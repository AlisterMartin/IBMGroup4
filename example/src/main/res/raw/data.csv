1,Designing for Outdoor Play,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Alsh 1,Gavin Wood  Northumbria University Jon Back  Uppsala University Jaz Hee-jeong Choi  RMIT University Thomas Dylan  Northumbria University Marti Louw  Carnegie Mellon University,There is widespread societal concern regarding the reduction in the amount of time that we all spend playing outdoors. Outdoor play can be important for our social and physical well-being and moreover helps us to connect to space  place and environment. Of course  the CHI community continues to explore play across many contexts; however  specifically designing for outdoor play remains underexplored. This workshop aims to bring together those who are interested in technological  social and design aspects of outdoor play for all ages. We will use participants' insights  energies and expertise to explore the challenges and focus on how we can build a community to share innovative designs  generate knowledge and make actionable research in this context.
2,With an Eye to the Future: HCI Practice and Research in the Arab World1,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Alsh 2,Ebtisam Alabdulqader  King Saud University Shaimaa Lazem  City of Scientific Research and Technology Applications Soud Nassir  University of Technology Sydney Mennatallah Saleh  Technical University inBerlin Sarah Armoush  Newcastle University Susan Dray  Dray Associates,ArabHCI initiative was inaugurated in a CHI17 SIG Meeting that brought together 45+ HCI Arab/non-Arab researchers/practitioners who are conducting/interested in HCI within Arab communities. The meeting started an ongoing dialogue that recognizes the fact that HCI is still in its infancy in the Arab world and explores challenges and opportunities for shaping the future of HCI in the region. The meeting was further followed by three successful meetings in SIGCHI sponsored events that included general discussions about the state of HCI research in Arab countries  and a thematic discussion on exploring participatory design practices with Arab communities. In this workshop  we build on the momentum generated by our previous meetings  and attempt to draw a roadmap for HCI research and practice in Arab world. Our goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss case studies from their own work  share experiences and lessons learned  and envision the future of the field in this area. We plan to share the results of our discussions and research agenda with the wider CHI community through various social and scholarly channels.
3,DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
4,DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.
5,DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
6,DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,"Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of ""futuring"" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities."
7,DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
8,DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
9,DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
10,DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.
11,DC09: Player Types of Gamers: Critical Evaluation,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Suvi K. Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
12,DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
13,DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
14,DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
15,DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
16,DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
17,DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
18,DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
19,DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
20,DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
21,DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.
22,DC20: Co-Designing Digital Technologies to Support Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Cara Wilson  Queensland University of Technology,This doctoral work considers how to best co-design with minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum in classroom contexts. It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.
23,HCI Across Borders and Intersections,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Neha Kumar  Georgia Institute of Technology Christian Sturm  Hamm-Lippstadt University of Applied Sciences Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed  University of Toronto Naveena Karusala  University of Washington Marisol Wong-Villacres  Georgia Institute of Technology Leonel Morales  Universidad Francisco Marroquín Rita Orji  Dalhousie University Michaelanne Dye  Georgia Institute of Technology Nova Ahmed  North South University Laura S. Gaytán-Lugo  Universidad de Colima Aditya Vashistha  University of Washington David Nemer  University of Kentucky Kurtis Heimerl  University of Washington Susan Dray  Dray Associates,The HCI Across Borders (HCIxB) community has been growing in recent years  thanks in particular to the Development Consortium at CHI 2016 and the HCIxB Symposia at CHI 2017 and 2018. This year  we propose an HCIxB symposium that continues to build scholarship potential of early career HCIxB researchers  strengthening ties between more and less experienced members of the community. We especially invite scholarship with a focus on intersections  examining and/or addressing multiple forms of marginalization (e.g. race  gender  class  among others).
24,EduCHI 2019 Symposium: Global Perspectives on HCI Education,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Argyll 3 CROWNE,Olivier St-Cyr  University of Toronto Craig M. MacDonald  Pratt Institute Elizabeth F. Churchill  Google Inc.,At CHI 2018  a workshop on developing a community of practice to support global HCI education was held  building on six years of research and collaboration in the area of HCI education. Many themes emerged from the workshop activities and discussions. Two particularly stood out: creating channels for discussions related to HCI education and providing a platform for sharing HCI curricula and teaching experiences. To that end  we are organizing a CHI 2019 symposium dedicated exclusively to HCI education: EduCHI 2019: Global Perspectives on HCI Education. The symposium will focus on the canons of HCI education in 2019 and beyond. It will offer a venue for HCI educators across disciplinary and geographical borders to discuss  dissect  and debate HCI teaching and learning. Through keynote addresses  paper presentations  and a panel discussion  we aim to discuss current and future HCI education trends  curricula  pedagogies  teaching practices  and diverse and inclusive HCI education. Post-symposium initiatives will aim to document and publish the discussions from the symposium.
25,HCI and Aging: Beyond Accessibility,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Boisdale 1,Bran Knowles  Lancaster University Vicki L. Hanson  The Association for Computing Machinery Yvonne Rogers  UCL Interaction Centre Anne Marie Piper  Northwestern University Jenny Waycott  The University of Melbourne Nigel Davies  Lancaster University,Despite improvements in the accessibility of digital technologies and growing numbers of tools designed specifically for older adults  adoption of such tools remains low for this demographic. This workshop aims to explore the contextual factors that contribute to reduced uptake among older adults in order to understand how to design digital technologies that will be appealing to and work for them  fitting with recent calls for more holistic approaches to designing for older adults. Going beyond standard accessibility considerations  and aiming to inform design of technologies for the general population rather than the design of senior-friendly variants of such tools  we will generate a set of principles for developing tools that older adults can and will use.
26,Looking into the Future: Weaving the Threads of Vehicle Automation,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Boisdale 2,Shadan Sadeghian Borojeni  Fraunhofer Institute Alexander Meschtscherjakov  University of Salzburg Bastian Pfleging  LMU Munich Wendy Ju  Cornell Tech Frank Flemisch  RWTH University Christian P. Janssen  Utrecht University Andrew L. Kun  University of New Hampshire Andreas Riener  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt,Automated driving is one of the most discussed disruptive technologies of this decade. It promises to increase drivers' safety and comfort  improve traffic flow  and lower fuel consumption. This has a significant impact on our everyday life and mobility behavior. Beyond the passengers of the vehicle  it also impacts others  for example by lowering the barriers to visit distant relatives. In line with the CHI2019 conference theme  our aim is to weave the threads of vehicle automation by gathering people from different disciplines  cultures  sectors  communities  and backgrounds (designers  researchers  and practitioners) in one community to look into concrete future scenarios of driving automation and its impact on HCI research and practice. Using design fiction  we will look into the future and use this fiction to guide discussions on how automated driving can be made a technology that works for people and society.
27,Where is the Human? Bridging the Gap Between AI and HCI,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Carron 1,Kori Inkpen  Microsoft Research Stevie Chancellor  Georgia Institute of Technology Munmun De Choudhury  Georgia Institute of Technology Michael Veale  University College London Eric P. S. Baumer  Lehigh University,In recent years  AI systems have become both more powerful and increasingly promising for integration in a variety of application areas. Attention has also been called to the social challenges these systems bring  particularly in how they might fail or even actively disadvantage marginalised social groups  or how their opacity might make them difficult to oversee and challenge. In the context of these and other challenges  the roles of humans working in tandem with these systems will be important  yet the HCI community has been only a quiet voice in these debates to date. This workshop aims to catalyse and crystallise an agenda around HCI's engagement with AI systems. Topics of interest include explainable and explorable AI; documentation and review; integrating artificial and human intelligence; collaborative decision making; AI/ML in HCI Design; diverse human roles and relationships in AI systems; and critical views of AI.
28,Hacking Blind Navigation,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Carron 2,João Guerreiro  Carnegie Mellon University Hernisa Kacorri  University of Maryland Jeffrey P. Bigham  Carnegie Mellon University Edward Cutrell  Microsoft Research Daisuke Sato  IBM Research - Tokyo Dragan Ahmetovic  Università degli Studi di Torino Chieko Asakawa  Carnegie Mellon University,Independent navigation in unfamiliar and complex environments is a major challenge for blind people. This challenge motivates a multi-disciplinary effort in the CHI community aimed at developing assistive technologies to support the orientation and mobility of blind people  including related disciplines such as accessible computing  cognitive sciences  computer vision  and ubiquitous computing. This workshop intends to bring these communities together to increase awareness on recent advances in blind navigation assistive technologies  benefit from diverse perspectives and expertises  discuss open research challenges  and explore avenues for multi-disciplinary collaborations. Interactions are fostered through a panel on Open Challenges and Avenues for Interdisciplinary Collaboration  Minute-Madness presentations  and a Hands-On Session where workshop participants can hack (design or prototype) new solutions to tackle open research challenges. An expected outcome is the emergence of new collaborations and research directions that can result in novel assistive technologies to support independent blind navigation.
29,Human-Centered Study of Data Science Work Practices,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Castle 1 CROWNE,Michael Muller  IBM Research Melanie Feinberg  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Timothy George  California Polytechnic Steven J. Jackson  Cornell University Bonnie E. John  Bloomberg L.P. Mary Beth Kery  Carnegie Mellon University Samir Passi  Cornell University,With the rise of big data  there has been an increasing need to understand who is working in data science and how they are doing their work. HCI and CSCW researchers have begun to examine these questions. In this workshop  we invite researchers to share their observations  experiences  hypotheses  and insights  in the hopes of developing a taxonomy of work practices and open issues in the behavioral and social study of data science and data science workers.
30,Troubling Innovation: Craft and Computing Across Boundaries,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Castle 2 CROWNE,Irene Posch  University of Art and Design Linz Ozge Subasi  Koc University Daniela K. Rosner  University of Washington Raune Frankjaer  Aarhus University Amit Zoran  Hebrew University Tania Pérez-Bustos  Universidad Nacional de Colombia,Craft practices such as needlework  ceramics  and woodworking have long informed and broadened the scope of HCI research. Whether through sewable microcontrollers or programs of small-scale production  they have helped widen the range of people and work recognised as technological and innovative. However  despite this promise  few organisational resources have successfully drawn together the disparate threads of scholarship and practice attending to HCI craft. In this workshop  we propose to gather a globally distributed group of craft contributors whose work reflects crucial but under-valued HCI positions  practices  and pedagogies  Through historically and politically engaged work  we seek to build community across boundaries and meaningfully broaden what constitutes innovation in HCI to date.
31,Designing for Digital Wellbeing: A Research & Practice Agenda,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Castle 3 CROWNE,Marta E. Cecchinato  Northumbria University John Rooksby  Northumbria University Alexis Hiniker  University of Washington Sean Munson  University of Washington Kai Lukoff  University of Washington Luigina Ciolfi  Sheffield Hallam University Anja Thieme  Microsoft Research Daniel Harrison  University College London,Traditionally  many consumer-focused technologies have been designed to maximize user engagement with their products and services. More recently  many technology companies have begun to introduce digital wellbeing features  such as for managing time spent and for encouraging breaks in use. These are in the context of  and likely in response to  renewed concerns in the media about technology dependency and even addiction. The promotion of technology abstinence is also increasingly widespread  e.g.  via digital detoxes. Given that digital technologies are an important and valuable feature of many people's lives  digital wellbeing features are arguably preferable to abstinence. However  how these are defined and designed is something that needs to be explored further. In this one-day workshop we welcome both industry and academic participants to discuss what digital wellbeing means  who is responsible for it  and whether and how we should design for it going forward.
32,Emerging Perspectives in Human-Centered Machine Learning,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Dochart 1,Gonzalo Ramos  Microsoft Research Jina Suh  Microsoft Research Soroush Ghorashi  Microsoft Research Christopher Meek  Microsoft Research Richard Banks  Microsoft Research Saleema Amershi  Microsoft Research Rebecca Fiebrink  Goldsmiths  University of London Alison Smith-Renner  University of Maryland Gagan Bansal  University of Washington,Current Machine Learning (ML) models can make predictions that are as good as or better than those made by people. The rapid adoption of this technology puts it at the forefront of systems that impact the lives of many  yet the consequences of this adoption are not fully understood. Therefore  work at the intersection of people's needs and ML systems is more relevant than ever. This area of work  dubbed Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML)  re-thinks ML research and systems in terms of human goals. HCML gathers an interdisciplinary group of HCI and ML practitioners  each bringing their unique  yet related perspectives. This one-day workshop is a successor of Gillies et al. 2016 CHI Workshop and focuses on recent advancements and emerging areas in HCML. We aim to discuss different perspectives on these areas and articulate a coordinated research agenda for the XXI century.

Mary Ellen Foster  University of Glasgow Kerstin Fischer  University of Southern Denmark Jessica R. Cauchard  Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya,The advances in Robotics offer exciting opportunities for robots to become socially collaborative technologies. But are we ready for and are the robots capable of enabling a good level of interaction and user experience? How can the CHI community work with the Human Robot Interaction (HRI) community to share best practices and methods in order to continue to advance research that crosses methodological and cultural boundaries between HRI and HCI? This workshop will bring together key researchers working in and across both HCI and HRI to share existing challenges and opportunities to advance the field of Socially Collaborative Robotics. We will look to share our recent research experiences and practices in order to build capacity in the crossings between HCI and HRI.
34,Technology to Mediate Role Conflict in Motherhood,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Fyne,Lisa Thomas  Northumbria University Elizabeth Sillence  Northumbria University Vicky Elsey  Northumbria University Emma Simpson  Newcastle University Louise Moody  Coventry University,Today  new mothers are experiencing parenthood differently. Digital resources can provide a wealth of information  present opportunities for socialising  and even assist in tracking a baby's development. However  women are often juggling the role of motherhood with other commitments  such as work. The aim of this workshop is to understand the digital support needs and practices during parenthood from the perspective of employed mothers. We are interested in exploring the ways that women utilise the technologies which have been designed to support mothers  and specifically  the importance of work-life balance and the various roles that mothers play. There is a need to better understand and identify which technologies are being used to support working women through their motherhood journey  and ensure a healthy transition to support women's changing identities.

The participants will reflect on how philosophy influenced the development of HCI in the past  how philosophical insights are being utilized in current HCI research  and how philosophy can help HCI identify and address the emerging challenges facing the field. The main objectives of the workshop are to bring together HCI researchers interested in philosophy and produce an agenda for future research bringing HCI and philosophy closer together.
37,DC^(2)S^(2): Designing Crowd-powered Creativity Support Systems,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Island A CROWNE,Jonas Oppenlaender  University of Oulu Maximilian Mackeprang  Freie Universität Berlin Abderrahmane Khiat  Freie Universität Berlin Maja Vuković  IBM Jorge Goncalves  The University of Melbourne Simo Hosio  University of Oulu,Supporting creativity has been considered as one of the grand challenges of Human Computer Interaction. All creativity lies within humanity and crowdsourcing is a powerful approach for tapping into the collective insights of diverse crowds. Thus  crowdsourcing has great potential in supporting creativity.In this workshop  we brainstorm new crowdsourcing systems and concepts for supporting creativity  by bringing together researchers and industry professionals in a full-day workshop. The workshop consists of discussions of ideas contributed by the participants and hands-on brainstorming sessions in groups for ideating new crowd-powered systems that support creativity. We center the workshop around two themes: supporting the individual and facilitating creativity in groups.
38,CHI 2019 Early Career Development Symposium,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Island B CROWNE,Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto Mississauga Sharon Oviatt  Monash University,The first few years after completing a PhD can be challenging to navigate. Job hunting  interviewing  navigating new contexts such as a junior academic position  applying for funding as a first time project investigator  learning to adapt to the culture of an industry-based workplace  supervising graduate students or full-time employees – these are just a few of the scenarios recent PhD graduates find themselves in. Within HCI  one may encounter more discipline-specific challenges  such as keeping up with the CHI publication cycles while taking on new administrative duties. The CHI community  however  strives to be collectively supportive and inclusive of researchers at all stages of their career – this is even more important as many of our design approaches are rooted in empathy for and empowerment of participants. By more actively supporting each other as researchers in our career paths  we can better grow as a community  and reflect it back into our collective body of practice. The Early Career Development Symposium has been proposed (and held yearly since 2016) to provide a more formal mentoring venue that reflects our aims as a community to more meaningfully support each other.

However  the work patients do to construct their functioning health service systems often remain invisible  with very little resources and technologies available to assist them. This workshop aims to bring together researchers  health practitioners  and patients to examine  discuss  and brainstorm ways to re-envision our healthcare service systems from the perspective of patients and caregivers. We aim to unpack the types of work that patients and caregivers do to reconfigure  reconstruct and adapt the healthcare infrastructure  and to brainstorm design solutions that can provide better infrastructuring assistance to them."

44,iHDI: International Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Alsh 1,Anke M. Brock  ENAC - University Toulouse Jessica R. Cauchard  IDC Herzliya Markus Funk  TU Darmstadt Jérémie Garcia  ENAC - University Toulouse Mohamed Khamis  University of Glasgow Matjaž Kljun  University of Primorska,Commercial drones have recently been developed to encompass use cases beyond aerial photography and videography. Researchers have explored wider applications of drones including using drones as social companions  as key components in virtual environments  as assistive tools for people with disabilities  and even as sport companions. However the uptake of research in Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) also brought forth a plethora of challenges that are unique to this platform. While drones were initially considered as flying robots  recent works have shown that traditional Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) methodologies cannot simply be applied to HDI. For example  how do we deal with privacy and safety concerns associated with drones in public space? What is the appropriate methodology to evaluate HDI applications? How do the size  altitude  and speed of drones influence their perception? The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to identify: 1) novel HDI applications  and 2) key challenges in this area to drive research in the coming decade. The long-term goal is to create a strong interdisciplinary research community that includes researchers and practitioners from HCI  HRI  Ubiquitous Computing  Interaction Techniques  User Privacy  and Design.
45,Challenges Using Head-Mounted Displays in Shared and Social Spaces,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Alsh 2,Jan Gugenheimer  Ulm University Christian Mai  LMU Munich Mark McGill  University of Glasgow Julie Williamson  University of Glasgow Frank Steinicke  Universität Hamburg Ken Perlin  New York University,Everyday mobile usage of AR and VR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) is becoming a feasible consumer reality. The current research agenda for HMDs has a strong focus on technological impediments (e.g. latency  field of view  locomotion  tracking  input) as well as perceptual aspect (e.g. distance compression  vergence-accomodation ). However  this ignores significant challenges in the usage and acceptability of HMDs in shared  social and public spaces. This workshop will explore these key challenges of HMD usage in shared  social contexts; methods for tackling the virtual isolation of the VR/AR user and the exclusion of collocated others; the design of shared experiences in shared spaces; and the ethical implications of appropriating the environment and those within it.
46,DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
47,DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.
48,DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
49,DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,"Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of ""futuring"" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities."
50,DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
51,DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
52,DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
53,DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.
54,DC09: Player Types of Gamers: Critical Evaluation,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Suvi K. Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
55,DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
56,DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
57,DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
58,DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
59,DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
60,DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
61,DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
62,DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
63,DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
64,DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.
65,DC20: Co-Designing Digital Technologies to Support Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Cara Wilson  Queensland University of Technology,This doctoral work considers how to best co-design with minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum in classroom contexts. It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.

We propose a Symposium at CHI 2019 to host WISH with the goal of facilitating a common space to share and discuss methods  study designs  and dissemination in a collaborative fashion. The symposium also aims to actively provide mentoring opportunities to junior and new health technology researchers – from undergraduates to mid-career researchers who want to focus on interactive systems in Healthcare. This will be the eighth WISH meeting in a series of successful workshops bringing together different research communities and practitioners around challenges of designing  implementing  and evaluating interactive health technologies.
67,4^(th) Symposium on Computing and Mental Health: Designing Ethical eMental Health Services,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Argyll 2 CROWNE,John Torous  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  Harvard Medical School Maria K. Wolters  University of Edinburgh Greg Wadley  University of Melbourne Rafael A. Calvo  University of Sydney,With psychiatric conditions like depression now the leading global causing of disability  the need for innovative solutions is apparent. The promise of mental health care delivered through technology (eMentalHealth) to provide personalized care offers a promising solution that has galvanized interest worldwide. However  in order to ensure that eMentalHealth is scalable and sustainable  service delivery and health and social care policies need to be integrated into the design of technology interventions. This will require new forms of interdisciplinary collaborations that we hope to foster in this symposium. Thus  in this fourth in our series of Symposia on Computing and Mental Health  the focus will beon the intersection of the communities innovating in this space: patients  designers  data scientists  clinicians  researchers  computer scientists  developers  and entrepreneurs guided by core medical ethical principles including respect for persons  beneficence  and justice. Our aim is thus to enable the vision of better mental health through ethical innovation powered by the right collaborations

69,Towards a Responsible Innovation Agenda for HCI,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Boisdale 1,Oliver Bates  Lancaster University Kathy New  Lancaster University Samantha Mitchell-Finnigan  Newcastle University Matthew Louis Mauriello  Stanford University Christian Remy  Aarhus University Roy Bendor  Delft University of Technology Samuel Mann  Otago Polytechnic Simran Chopra  Northumbria University Adrian K. Clear  Northumbria University Chris Preist  University of Bristol,In recent years responsible innovation has gained significant traction and can be seen to adorn a myriad of research platforms  education programs  and policy frameworks. In this workshop  we invite HCI researchers to discuss the relations between the CHI community and responsible innovation. This workshop looks to build provocations and principles for and with HCI researchers who are or wish to become responsible innovators. The workshop looks to do this by asking attendees to think about the social  environmental  and economic impacts of ICT and HCI and explore how research innovation frameworks speak to responsible HCI innovation. Through the workshop we look to examine 5 questions to develop a set of provocations and principles  which will help encourage HCI and computer science researchers  educators  and innovators to reflect on the impact of their research and innovation.

While automationsystems have been a realm for highly specialized tasks and trained experts until recently  now moreand more non-expert users encounter automated systems in their everyday life. The deploymentof these systems fundamentally changes practices and experiences in various domains. The overallgoal of this workshop is to investigate the requirements and design criteria for automation that areexperienced in everyday situations. In particular we will strive to come up with a set of principles forthree key areas of everyday automation experience: intelligibility  experienced control  and capturingautomation experience. This way  the workshop provides a first forum for knowledge exchange andnetworking across usage domains and contexts.
71,Computational Modeling in Human-Computer Interaction,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Carron 1,Nikola Banovic  University of Michigan Antti Oulasvirta  Aalto University Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge,We propose a workshop on rapidly emerging topic of Computational Modeling in HCI to address the challenges of increasing complexity of human behaviors we are able to track and collect today. The goal of this workshop is to reconcile two seemingly competing approaches to computational modeling: theoretical modeling  which seeks to explain behaviors vs. algorithmic modeling  which seeks to predict behaviors. The workshop will address: 1) convergence of the two approaches at the intersection of HCI  2) updates to theoretical and methodological foundations  3) bringing disparate modeling communities to CHI  and 4) sharing datasets  code  and best practices. This workshop seeks to establish Computational Modeling as a theoretical foundation for work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to model the human accurately across domains and support design  optimization  and evaluation of user interfaces to solve a variety of human-centered problems.
72,CHInclusion: Working Toward a More Inclusive HCI Community,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Carron 2,Angelika Strohmayer  Newcastle University Cayley MacArthur  University of Waterloo Velvet Spors  University of Nottingham Michael Muller  IBM Research Morgan Vigil-Hayes  Northern Arizona University Ebtisam Alabdulqader  King Saud University & Newcastle University,HCI has a growing body of work regarding important social and community issues  as well as various grassroots communities working to make CHI more international and inclusive. In this workshop  we will build on this work: first reflecting on the contemporary CHI climate  and then developing an actionable plan towards making CHI2019 and subsequent SIGCHI events and sister conferences more inclusive for all.
73,The Body as Starting Point: Applying Inside Body Knowledge for Inbodied Design,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Castle 1 CROWNE,Josh Andres  IBM Research & Exertion Games Lab and RMIT m.c. schraefel  University of Southampton Aaron Tabor  University of New Brunswick Eric B. Hekler  University of California  San Diego,Inbodied design is an emerging area in HCI that focuses on using knowledge of the body's internal systems and processes to better inform em-bodied and circum-bodied design spaces. The current challenge in developing an inbodied approach to HCI research/design is domain expertise: accessing sufficient and appropriate information about how the body itself works and how the body's different systems interact dynamically. In this workshop  we review and build on last year's introduction to inbodied foundations  focusing on applying inbodied knowledge to design challenges to explore (1) the foundational pillars of the inbodied design approach  and (2) how inbodied knowledge can affect / alter our understanding of em-bodied and circum-bodied design challenges and better inform design decisions. Our aim with this hands-on and cross-domain workshop is for HCI researchers to create innovative designs taking the body as a starting point
74,Sensitive Research  Practice and Design in HCI,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Castle 2 CROWNE,Stevie Chancellor  Georgia Tech Nazanin Andalibi  University of Michigan Lindsay Blackwell  University of Michigan David Nemer  University of Kentucky Wendy Moncur  University of Dundee,New research areas in HCI examine complex and sensitive research areas  such as crisis  life transitions  and mental health. Further  research in complex topics such as harassment and graphic content can leave researchers vulnerable to emotional and physical harm. There is a need to bring researchers together to discuss challenges across sensitive research spaces and environments. We propose a workshop to explore the methodological  ethical  and emotional challenges of sensitive research in HCI. We will actively recruit from diverse research environments (industry  academia  government  etc.) and methods areas (qualitative  quantitative  design practices  etc.) and identify commonalities in and encourage relationship-building between these areas. This one-day workshop will be led by academic and industry researchers with diverse methods  topical  and employment experiences.
75,Conversational Agents: Acting on the Wave of Research and Development,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Castle 3 CROWNE,Richard Jacques  Microsoft Asbjørn Følstad  SINTEF Elizabeth Gerber  Northwestern University Jonathan Grudin  Microsoft Ewa Luger  Edinburgh University Andrés Monroy-Hernández  Snap Inc. Dakuo Wang  IBM T.J. Watson Research Center,In the last five years  work on software that interacts with people via typed or spoken natural language  called chatbots  intelligent assistants  social bots  virtual companions  non-human players  and so on  increased dramatically. Chatbots burst into prominence in 2016. Then came a wave of research  more development  and some use. The time is right to assess what we have learned from endeavouring to build conversational user interfaces that simulate quasi-human partners engaged in real conversations with real people. This workshop brings together people who developed or studied various conversational agents  to explore themes that include what works (and hasn't) in home  education  healthcare  and work settings  what we have learned from this about people and their activities  and social or ethical possibilities for good or risk.

Alavi  University of Fribourg Silvia Lindtner  University of Michigan Ding Wang  Microsoft Research,We invite scholars  designers  developers  policymakers and provocateurs to explore non-standard  global and virtual work futures  to reflect on the impact of new sites and temporal patterns of work  and to consider emerging interpersonal and person-machine dynamics within work. We will frame these discussions with a consideration of the relationship between the future of work and existing modes of labor and political economy  with a view to identifying possibilities for both technological innovation and systemic change.
77,CHI4EVIL: Creative Speculation on the Negative Impacts of HCI Research,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Dochart 2,Robert Soden  University of Colorado Michael Skirpan  Carnegie Melon University Casey Fiesler  University of Colorado Zahra Ashktorab  IBM Research Eric P. S. Baumer  Lehigh University Mark Blythe  Northumbria University Jasmine Jones  University of Minnesota,The HCI community is experiencing a resurgence of interest in the ethical  social  and political dimensions of HCI research and practice. Despite increased attention to these issues is not always clear that our community has the tools or training to adequately think through some of the complex issues that these commitments raise. In this workshop  we will explore the creative use of HCI methods and concepts such as design fiction or speculative design to help anticipate and reflect on the potential downsides of our technology design  research  and implementation. How can these tools help us to critique some of the assumptions  metaphors  and patterns that drive our field forward? Can we  by intentionally adopting the personas of would-be evil-doers  learn something about how better to accomplish HCI for Good?
78,All the World (Wide Web)'s a Stage: A Workshop on Live Streaming,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Fyne,Raquel Breejon Robinson  University of Saskatchewan Jessica Hammer  Carnegie Mellon University Katherine Isbister  University of California Santa Cruz,With the rise of live streaming and esports in recent years  it becomes increasingly important for the HCI community to understand this phenomenon. The organizers encourage people to submit papers with novel interfaces they wish to explore in a live streaming context. In this workshop  participants will discuss different facets of the live streaming experience and obtain a greater understanding of the culture that exists on streaming platforms like Twitch. They will then participate in a design exercise  forming groups and iterating on a design together. Discussion/design topics will include ideas encouraging audience participation  moderation of toxicity  and other such topics. Participants will leave the workshop with ideas about how they can better design games and other experiences taking the live streaming ecosystem into consideration.
79,Addressing the Challenges of Situationally-Induced Impairments and Disabilities in Mobile Interaction,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Gala 1,Garreth W. Tigwell  University of Dundee Zhanna Sarsenbayeva  University of Melbourne Benjamin M. Gorman  Bournemouth University David R. Flatla  University of Guelph Jorge Goncalves  University of Melbourne Yeliz Yesilada  Middle East Technical University Northern Cyprus Campus Jacob O. Wobbrock  University of Washington,Situationally-induced impairments and disabilities (SIIDs) make it difficult for users of interactive computing systems to perform tasks due to context (e.g.  listening to a phone call when in a noisy crowd) rather than a result of a congenital or acquired impairment (e.g.  hearing damage). SIIDs are a great concern when considering the ubiquitousness of technology in a wide range of contexts. Considering our daily reliance on technology  and mobile technology in particular  it is increasingly important that we fully understand and model how SIIDs occur. Similarly  we must identify appropriate methods for sensing and adapting technology to reduce the effects of SIIDs. In this workshop  we will bring together researchers working on understanding  sensing  modelling  and adapting technologies to ameliorate the effects of SIIDs. This workshop will provide a venue to identify existing research gaps  new directions for future research  and opportunities for future collaboration.
80,Mid-Air Haptic Interfaces for Interactive Digital Signage and Kiosks,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Gala 2,Orestis Georgiou  Ultrahaptics Hannah Limerick  Ultrahaptics Loïc Corenthy  Ultrahaptics Mark Perry  Brunel University London Mykola Maksymenko  Softserve Sam Frish  Softserve Jörg Müller  University of Bayreuth Myroslav Bachynskyi  Bayreuth University Jin Ryong Kim  Alibaba Group,Digital signage systems are transitioning from static displays to rich  dynamic interactive experiences while new enabling technologies that support these interactions are also evolving. For instance  advances in computer vision and face  gaze  facial expression  body and hand-gesture recognition have enabled new ways of distal interactivity with digital content. Such possibilities are only just being adopted by advertisers and retailers  yet  they face important challenges e.g. the lack of a commonly accepted gesture  facial expressions or call-to-action set. Another common issue here is the absence of active tactile stimuli. Mid-air haptic interfaces can help alleviate these problems and aid in defining a gesture set  informing users about their interaction via haptic feedback loops  and enhancing the overall user experience. This workshop aims to examine the possibilities opened up by these technologies and discuss opportunities in designing the next generation of interactive digital signage kiosks.
81,HCI for Accurate  Impartial and Transparent Journalism: Challenges and Solutions,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Island A CROWNE,Tanja Aitamurto  Northwestern Mike Ananny  University of Southern California Chris W. Anderson  University of Leeds Larry Birnbaum  Northwestern University Nicholas Diakopoulos  Northwestern University Matilda Hanson  Dagens Nyheter Jessica Hullman  Northwestern Nick Ritchie  BBC,While new media technologies hold the potential to serve journalism's dual goals of informing and engaging the public  these technologies also challenge the journalistic norms of accuracy  impartiality and transparency. The key question in this workshop is: How can HCI support accurate  impartial and transparent journalism? This question is ever more timely as the need for accurate and credible journalism is growing amid the proliferation of disinformation and opinion manipulation. In this workshop  we will identify challenges and solutions in the design of user interfaces  user experiences and production processes in journalism. We bring together researchers and practitioners designing  deploying and studying new technologies in journalism. The goal of the workshop is to harness the potential of HCI for supporting accurate  impartial and transparent journalism.
82,New Directions for the IoT: Automate  Share  Build  and Care,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Island B CROWNE,Carolina Fuentes  University of Nottingham Martin Porcheron  University of Nottingham Joel Fischer  University of Nottingham Enrico Costanza  University College London Nervo Verdezoto  University of Leicester Valeria Herskovic  Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile Oren Zuckerman  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Leila Takayama  University of California  Santa Cruz,As the IoT is taking hold in the home  in healthcare  factories  and industry  new challenges and approaches arise for HCI research and design. For example  HCI is exploring agency delegation and automation to support the user in managing the deluge of IoT data  make decisions  or even take actions on behalf of the user  while economic models are being proposed to drive sharing economy services. This creates new problems including how to design appropriate solutions for uncertain and dynamic human behaviour  how to ensure resources are distributed fairly  and how to ensure that the user can understand system actions and ultimately remains in control. These issues are becoming more pertinent as the IoT diversifies into safety-critical domains such as manufacturing and healthcare. This one-day workshop intends to bring together the CHI community to explore the interactional  socio-cultural  ethical  and practical challenges and approaches that these new domains raise for the IoT. With this  we want to consider how such approaches could be integrated to achieve more sustainable  inclusive  or effective interactions.

Moore  University of Sheffield Jens Edlund  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Eva Szekely  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Patrick Healey  Queen Mary University of London Naomi Harte  Trinity College Dublin Ilaria Torre  Trinity College Dublin Philip Doyle  Voysis Ltd.,The use of speech as an interaction modality has grown considerably through the integration of Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs- e.g. Siri  Google Assistant) into smartphones and voice based devices (e.g. Amazon Echo). However  there remain significant gaps in using theoretical frameworks to understand user behaviours and choices and how they may applied to specific speech interface interactions. This part-day multidisciplinary workshop aims to critically map out and evaluate theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches across a number of disciplines and establish directions for new paradigms in understanding speech interface user behaviour. In doing so  we will bring together participants from HCI and other speech related domains to establish a cohesive  diverse and collaborative community of researchers from academia and industry with interest in exploring theoretical and methodological issues in the field.

New immersive technologies present many opportunities for enhancing humans' experiences with data interaction  but also present many challenges  a subset of which are specific to the analytics domain. This workshop is centered around a set of group prototyping sessions  aimed at identifying new approaches to existing design challenges. In addition to giving perspective on opportunities and difficulties faced by future designers  these exercises will also explore new prototyping methods and tools for the design of interactive data-centric interfaces. This part-day workshop aims to build new ties between the existing immersive analytics community with researchers across many disciplines of the CHI community.

93,SeeingVR: A Set of Tools to Make Virtual Reality More Accessible to People with Low Vision,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Yuhang Zhao  Cornell Tech & Microsoft Research Edward Cutrell  Microsoft Research Christian Holz  Microsoft Research Meredith Ringel Morris  Microsoft Research Eyal Ofek  Microsoft Research Andrew D. Wilson  Microsoft Research,Current virtual reality applications do not support people who have low vision  i.e.  vision loss that falls short of complete blindness but is not correctable by glasses. We present SeeingVR  a set of 14 tools that enhance a VR application for people with low vision by providing visual and audio augmentations. A user can select  adjust  and combine different tools based on their preferences. Nine of our tools modify an existing VR application post hoc via a plugin without developer effort. The rest require simple inputs from developers using a Unity toolkit we created that allows integrating all 14 of our low vision support tools during development. Our evaluation with 11 participants with low vision showed that SeeingVR enabled users to better enjoy VR and complete tasks more quickly and accurately. Developers also found our Unity toolkit easy and convenient to use.
94,Virtual Showdown: An Accessible Virtual Reality Game with Scaffolds for Youth with Visual Impairments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Ryan Wedoff  Microsoft Lindsay Ball  The College at Brockport  State University of New York Amelia Wang  University of Washington Yi Xuan Khoo  University of Iowa Lauren Lieberman  The College at Brockport  State University of New York Kyle K. Rector  University of Iowa,Virtual Reality (VR) is a growing source of entertainment  but people who are visually impaired have not been effectively included. Audio cues are motivated as a complement to visuals  making experiences more immersive  but are not a primary cue. To address this  we implemented a VR game called Virtual Showdown. We based Virtual Showdown on an accessible real-world game called Showdown  where people use their hearing to locate and hit a ball against an opponent. Further  we developed Verbal and Verbal/Vibration Scaffolds to teach people how to play Virtual Showdown. We assessed the acceptability of Virtual Showdown and compared our scaffolds in an empirical study with 34 youth who are visually impaired. Thirty-three participants wanted to play Virtual Showdown again  and we learned that participants scored higher with the Verbal Scaffold or if they had prior Showdown experience. Our empirical findings inform the design of future accessible VR experiences.
95,Examining Augmented Virtuality Impairment Simulation for Mobile App Accessibility Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo  Singapore Management University Rajesh Krishna Balan  Singapore Management University Youngki Lee  Seoul National University,With mobile apps rapidly permeating all aspects of daily living with use by all segments of the population  it is crucial to support the evaluation of app usability for specific impaired users to improve app accessibility. In this work  we examine the effects of using our augmented virtuality impairment simulation system--Empath-D--to support experienced designer-developers to redesign a mockup of commonly used mobile application for cataract-impaired users  comparing this with existing tools that aid designing for accessibility. We show that the use of augmented virtuality for assessing usability supports enhanced usability challenge identification  finding more defects and doing so more accurately than with existing methods. Through our user interviews  we also show that augmented virtuality impairment simulation supports realistic interaction and evaluation to provide a concrete understanding over the usability challenges that impaired users face  and complements the existing guidelines-based approaches meant for general accessibility.
96,The Effect of Field-of-View Restriction on Sex Bias in VR Sickness and Spatial Navigation Performance,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Majed Al Zayer  University of Nevada Isayas B. Adhanom  University of Nevada Paul MacNeilage  University of Nevada Eelke Folmer  University of Nevada,Recent studies show that women are more susceptible to visually-induced VR sickness  which might explain the low adoption rate of VR technology among women. Reducing field-of-view (FOV) during locomotion is already a widely used strategy to reduce VR sickness as it blocks peripheral optical flow perception and mitigates visual/vestibular conflict. Prior studies show that men are more adept at 3D spatial navigation than women  though this sex bias can be minimized by providing women with a larger FOV. Our study provides insight into the relationship between sex and FOV restriction with respect to VR sickness and spatial navigation performance which seem to conflict. We find the use of an FOV restrictor to be effective in mitigating VR sickness in both sexes while we did not find a negative effect of FOV restriction on spatial navigation performance.
97,Shape Structuralizer: Design  Fabrication  and User-driven Iterative Refinement of 3D Mesh Models,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Subramanian Chidambaram  Purdue University Yunbo Zhang  Rochester Institute of Technology Venkatraghavan Sundararajan  Purdue university Niklas Elmqvist  University of Maryland  College Park Karthik Ramani  Purdue University,Current Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools lack proper support for guiding novice users towards designs ready for fabrication. We propose Shape Structuralizer (SS)  an interactive design support system that repurposes surface models into structural constructions using rods and custom 3D-printed joints. Shape Structuralizer embeds a recommendation system that computationally supports the user during design ideation by providing design suggestions on local refinements of the design. This strategy enables novice users to choose designs that both satisfy stress constraints as well as their personal design intent. The interactive guidance enables users to repurpose existing surface mesh models  analyze them in-situ for stress and displacement constraints  add movable joints to increase functionality  and attach a customized appearance. This also empowers novices to fabricate even complex constructs while ensuring structural soundness. We validate the Shape Structuralizer tool with a qualitative user study where we observed that even novice users were able to generate a large number of structurally safe designs for fabrication.
98,JigFab: Computational Fabrication of Constraints to Facilitate Woodworking with Power Tools,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Danny Leen  Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Tom Veuskens  Hasselt University Kris Luyten  Hasselt University - tUL - Flanders Make Raf Ramakers  Hasselt University,We present JigFab  an integrated end-to-end system that supports casual makers in designing and fabricating constructions with power tools. Starting from a digital version of the construction  JigFab achieves this by generating various types of constraints that configure and physically aid the movement of a power tool. Constraints are generated for every operation and are custom to the work piece. Constraints are laser cut and assembled together with predefined parts to reduce waste. JigFab's constraints are used according to an interactive step-by-step manual. JigFab internalizes all the required domain knowledge for designing and building intricate structures  consisting of various types of finger joints  tenon & mortise joints  grooves  and dowels. Building such structures is normally reserved for artisans or automated with advanced CNC machinery.
99,Digital Fabrication of Soft Actuated Objects by Machine Knitting,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Lea Albaugh  Carnegie Mellon University Scott Hudson  Carnegie Mellon University Lining Yao  Carnegie Mellon University,With recent interest in shape-changing interfaces  material-driven design  wearable technologies  and soft robotics  digital fabrication of soft actuatable material is increasingly in demand. Much of this research focuses on elastomers or non-stretchy air bladders. Computationally-controlled machine knitting offers an alternative fabrication technology which can rapidly produce soft textile objects that have a very different character: breathable  lightweight  and pleasant to the touch. These machines are well established and optimized for the mass production of garments  but compared to other digital fabrication techniques such as CNC machining or 3D printing  they have received much less attention as general purpose fabrication devices. In this work  we explore new ways to employ machine knitting for the creation of actuated soft objects. We describe the basic operation of this type of machine  then show new techniques for knitting tendon-based actuation into objects. We explore a series of design strategies for integrating tendons with shaping and anisotropic texture design. Finally  we investigate different knit material properties  including considerations for motor control and sensing.
100,Understanding Metamaterial Mechanisms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Alexandra Ion  Hasso Plattner Institute David Lindlbauer  Technische Universität Berlin & ETH Zurich Philipp Herholz  Technische Universität Berlin Marc Alexa  Technische Universität Berlin Patrick Baudisch  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam ,In this paper  we establish the underlying foundations of mechanisms that are composed of cell structures---known as metamaterial mechanisms. Such metamaterial mechanisms were previously shown to implement complete mechanisms in the cell structure of a 3D printed material  without the need for assembly. However  their design is highly challenging. A mechanism consists of many cells that are interconnected and impose constraints on each other. This leads to unobvious and non-linear behavior of the mechanism  which impedes user design. In this work  we investigate the underlying topological constraints of such cell structures and their influence on the resulting mechanism. Based on these findings  we contribute a computational design tool that automatically creates a metamaterial mechanism from user-defined motion paths. This tool is only feasible because our novel abstract representation of the global constraints highly reduces the search space of possible cell arrangements.
101,Towards Metrics of Meaningfulness for Tech Practitioners,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Vanessa Julia Carpenter  IdemoLab  FORCE Technology & Aalborg University Elisa D. Mekler  University of Basel,HCI and the tech industry are increasingly interested in designing products that afford meaningful user experiences. Yet while several metrics of meaningfulness have been suggested  their utility and relevance for industry is unclear. We conducted workshops with 9 welfare technology companies and presented them with different metrics from existing literature in HCI  psychology  and industry  to evaluate their product and consider how relevant designing for meaningfulness is for them in their practice. We point to four metrics which companies considered particularly relevant  and suggest that further defining metrics of meaningfulness in HCI would be beneficial to both academia and industry.
102,Designing an Informal Learning Curriculum to Develop 3D Modeling Knowledge and Improve Spatial Thinking Skills,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Srinjita Bhaduri  University of Colorado Boulder Katie Van Horne  University of Colorado Boulder Tamara Sumner  University of Colorado Boulder,We report on the design and implementation of a 3-week long summer academy introducing high school students to 3D modeling and 3D printing experiences. Supporting youth in developing 3D modeling knowledge can enhance their capacity to effectively use an array of emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality  Augmented Reality  and digital fabrication. We used tools and practices from both formal and informal education  such as storylining  to inform the design of the curriculum. We collected data through surveys  artifacts  observations  screen recordings  and group videos. Our findings suggest that (1) emphasizing curricular coherence as a design goal and (2) providing youth with multiple avenues for engaging in 3D modeling can help to: spark youth interest in 3D printing/modeling  maintain youth engagement in learning activities over the course of several weeks  and provide youth with opportunities to develop their spatial thinking skills.

This program focused on generating a Single Usability Metric (SUM) score across products over time but encountered a number of issues including error rate reliability  challenges establishing objective time-on-task targets  and scale anchoring. These issues contributed to making SUM difficult to communicate  prompting exploration of an alternative single usability metric using simple thresholds developed from anchor text and inter-metric correlations.

Kyle Pedersen  Google Inc.,Measuring user experience (UX) is an important part of the design process  yet there are few methods to evaluate UX in the early phases of product development. We introduce Triptech  a method used to quickly explore novel product ideas. We present how it was used to gauge the frequency and importance of user needs  to assess the desirability and perceived usefulness of design concepts  and to draft UX requirements for Now Playing—an on-device music recognition system for the Pixel 2. We discuss the merits and limitations of the Triptech method and its applicability to tech-driven innovation practices.

What information can the visual system effortlessly extract  and what requires slower  more cognitive processes? What does eye-tracking data tell us about what users perceive? Vision scientists have recently made ground-breaking progress in understanding many aspects of vision that are key to good design. A critical determining factor is what information is available at a glance. This course reviews state-of-the-art vision science  including a computational model that visualizes the available information. We will demonstrate use of this model in evaluating and guiding visual designs.

107,NaviBike: Comparing Unimodal Navigation Cues for Child Cyclists,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Andrii Matviienko  OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology Swamy Ananthanarayan  University of Oldenburg Abdallah El Ali  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) Wilko Heuten  OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology Susanne Boll  University of Oldenburg,Navigation systems for cyclists are commonly screen-based devices mounted on the handlebar which show map information. Typically  adult cyclists have to explicitly look down for directions. This can be distracting and challenging for children  given their developmental differences in motor and perceptual-motor abilities compared with adults. To address this issue  we designed different unimodal cues and explored their suitability for child cyclists through two experiments. In the first experiment  we developed an indoor bicycle simulator and compared auditory  light  and vibrotactile navigation cues. In the second experiment  we investigated these navigation cues in-situ in an outdoor practice test track using a mid-size tricycle. To simulate road distractions  children were given an additional auditory task in both experiments. We found that auditory navigational cues were the most understandable and the least prone to navigation errors. However  light and vibrotactile cues might be useful for educating younger child cyclists.
108,At Your Service: Designing Voice Assistant Personalities to Improve Automotive User Interfaces: A Real World Driving Study,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Michael Braun  BMW Group Research  New Technologies  Innovations & Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Anja Mainz  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Ronee Chadowitz  BMW Group Research  New Technologies  Innovations Bastian Pfleging  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Florian Alt  Bundeswehr University Munich & Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich,This paper investigates personalized voice characters for in-car speech interfaces. In particular  we report on how we designed different personalities for voice assistants and compared them in a real world driving study. Voice assistants have become important for a wide range of use cases  yet current interfaces are using the same style of auditory response in every situation  despite varying user needs and personalities.To close this gap  we designed four assistant personalities (Friend  Admirer  Aunt  and Butler) and compared them to a baseline (Default) in a between-subject study in real traffic conditions. Our results show higher likability and trust for assistants that correctly match the user's personality while we observed lower likability  trust  satisfaction  and usefulness for incorrectly matched personalities  each in comparison with the Default character. We discuss design aspects for voice assistants in different automotive use cases.
109,In UX We Trust: Investigation of Aesthetics and Usability of Driver-Vehicle Interfaces and Their Impact on the Perception of Automated Driving,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Anna-Katharina Frison  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University Philipp Wintersberger  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University Andreas Riener  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt Clemens Schartmüller  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University Linda Ng Boyle  University of Washington Erika Miller  Colorado State University Klemens Weigl  Katholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt & Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt,In the evolution of technical systems  freedom from error and early adoption plays a major role for market success and to maintain competitiveness. In the case of automated driving  we see that faulty systems are put into operation and users trust these systems  often without any restrictions. Trust and use are often associated with users' experience of the driver-vehicle interfaces and interior design. In this work  we present the results of our investigations on factors that influence the perception of automated driving. In a simulator study  N=48 participants had to drive a SAE level 2 vehicle with either perfect or faulty driving function. As a secondary activity  participants had to solve tasks on an infotainment system with varying aesthetics and usability (2x2). Results reveal that the interaction of conditions significantly influences trust and UX of the vehicle system. Our conclusion is that all aspects of vehicle design cumulate to system and trust perception.
110,PicMe: Interactive Visual Guidance for Taking Requested Photo Composition,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Minju Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Jungjin Lee  KAI Inc.,PicMe is a mobile application that provides interactive on-screen guidance that helps the user take pictures of a composition that another person requires. Once the requester captures a picture of the desired composition and delivers it to the user (photographer)  a 2.5D guidance system  called the virtual frame  guides the user in real-time by showing a three-dimensional composition of the target image (i.e.  size and shape). In addition  according to the matching accuracy rate  we provide a small-sized target image in an inset window as feedback and edge visualization for further alignment of the detail elements. We implemented PicMe to work fully in mobile environments. We then conducted a preliminary user study to evaluate the effectiveness of PicMe compared to traditional 2D guidance methods. The results show that PicMe helps users reach their target images more accurately and quickly by giving participants more confidence in their tasks.
111,How to Design Voice Based Navigation for How-To Videos,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Minsuk Chang  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Anh Truong  Adobe Research Oliver Wang  Adobe Research Maneesh Agrawala  Stanford University Juho Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,When watching how-to videos related to physical tasks  users' hands are often occupied by the task  making voice input a natural fit. To better understand the design space of voice interactions for how-to video navigation  we conducted three think-aloud studies using: 1) a traditional video interface  2) a research probe providing a voice controlled video interface  and 3) a wizard-of-oz interface. From the studies  we distill seven navigation objectives and their underlying intents: pace control pause  content alignment pause  video control pause  reference jump  replay jump  skip jump  and peek jump. Our analysis found that users' navigation objectives and intents affect the choice of referent type and referencing approach in command utterances. Based on our findings  we recommend to 1) support conversational strategies like sequence expansions and command queues  2) allow users to identify and refine their navigation objectives explicitly  and 3) support the seven interaction intents.
112,B-Script: Transcript-based B-roll Video Editing with Recommendations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Bernd Huber  Harvard University Hijung Valentina Shin  Adobe Research Bryan Russell  Adobe Research Oliver Wang  Adobe Research Gautham J. Mysore  Adobe Research,In video production  inserting B-roll is a widely used technique to enrich the story and make a video more engaging. However  determining the right content and positions of B-roll and actually inserting it within the main footage can be challenging  and novice producers often struggle to get both timing and content right. We present B-Script  a system that supports B-roll video editing via interactive transcripts. B-Script has a built-in recommendation system trained on expert-annotated data  recommending users B-roll position and content. To evaluate the system  we conducted a within-subject user study with 110 participants  and compared three interface variations: a timeline-based editor  a transcript-based editor  and a transcript-based editor with recommendations. Users found it easier and were faster to insert B-roll using the transcript-based interface  and they created more engaging videos when recommendations were provided.
113,TutoriVR: A Video-Based Tutorial System for Design Applications in Virtual Reality,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Balasaravanan Thoravi Kumaravel  University of California  Berkeley Cuong Nguyen  Adobe Research Stephen DiVerdi  Adobe Research Björn Hartmann  University of California  Berkeley,Virtual Reality painting is a form of 3D-painting done in a Virtual Reality (VR) space. Being a relatively new kind of art form  there is a growing interest within the creative practices community to learn it. Currently  most users learn using community posted 2D-videos on the internet  which are a screencast recording of the painting process by an instructor. While such an approach may suffice for teaching 2D-software tools  these videos by themselves fail in delivering crucial details that required by the user to understand actions in a VR space. We conduct a formative study to identify challenges faced by users in learning to VR-paint using such video-based tutorials. Informed by results of this study  we develop a VR-embedded tutorial system that supplements video tutorials with 3D and contextual aids directly in the user's VR environment. An exploratory evaluation showed users were positive about the system and were able to use the proposed system to recreate painting tasks in VR.
114,Interactive Body-Driven Graphics for Augmented Video Performance,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Nazmus Saquib  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Rubaiat Habib Kazi  Adobe Research Li-Yi Wei  Adobe Research Wilmot Li  Adobe,We present a system that augments live presentation videos with interactive graphics to create a powerful and expressive storytelling environment. Using our system  the presenter interacts with the graphical elements in real-time with gestures and postures  thus leveraging our innate  everyday skills to enhance our communication capabilities with the audience. However  crafting such an interactive and expressive performance typically requires programming  or highly-specialized tools tailored for experts. Our core contribution is a flexible  direct manipulation UI which enables amateurs and experts to craft such presentations beforehand by mapping a variety of body movements to a wide range of graphical manipulations. By simplifying the mapping between gestures  postures  and their corresponding output effects  our UI enables users to craft customized  rich interactions with the graphical elements. Our user study demonstrates the potential usage and unique affordance of this mixed-reality medium for storytelling and presentation across a range of application domains.
115,Patient Perspectives on Self-Management Technologies for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Tabby Davies  University of Bath Simon L. Jones  University of Bath Ryan M. Kelly  The University of Melbourne,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating medical condition that is characterized by a range of physical  cognitive and social impairments. This paper investigates CFS patients' perspectives on the potential for technological support for self-management of their symptoms. We report findings from three studies in which people living with CFS 1) prioritized symptoms that they would like technologies to address  2) articulated their current approaches to self-management alongside challenges they face  and 3) reflected on their experiences with three commercial smartphone apps related to symptom management. We contribute an understanding of the specific needs of the ME/CFS population and the ways in which they currently engage in self-management using technology. The paper ends by describing five high-level design recommendations for ME/CFS self-management technologies.
116,Tricky to get your head around: Information Work of People Managing Chronic Kidney Disease in the UK,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Eleanor R. Burgess  Northwestern University Madhu C. Reddy  Northwestern University Andrew Davenport  Royal Free Hospital Paul Laboi  York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Ann Blandford  University College London,People diagnosed with a chronic health condition have many information needs which healthcare providers  patient groups  and resource designers seek to support. However  as a disease progresses  knowing when  how  and for what purposes patients want to interact with and construct personal meaning from health-related information is still unclear. This paper presents findings regarding the information work of chronic kidney disease patients. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 patients and 6 clinicians  and observations at 9 patient group events. We used the stages of the information journey – recognizing need  seeking  interpreting  and using information – to frame our data analysis. We identified two distinct but often overlapping information work phases  'Learning' and 'Living With' a chronic condition to show how patient information work activities shift over time. We also describe social and individual factors influencing information work  and discuss technology design opportunities including customized education and collaboration tools.
117,Supporting Communication About Values Between People with Multiple Chronic Conditions and their Providers,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Andrew B. L. Berry  University of Washington Catherine Y. Lim  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute Tad Hirsch  Northeastern University Andrea L. Hartzler  University of Washington Linda M. Kiel  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute Zoë A. Bermet  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute James D. Ralston  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute,People with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) often disagree with healthcare providers on priorities for care  leading to worse health outcomes. To align priorities  there is a need to support patient-provider communication about what patients consider important for their well-being and health (i.e.  their personal values). To address barriers to communication about values  we conducted a two-part study with key stakeholders in MCC care: patients  informal caregivers  and providers. In Part I  co-design activities generated seven dimensions that characterize stakeholders' diverse ideas for supporting communication about values: explicitness  effort  disclosure  guidance  intimacy  scale  and synchrony. In Part II  we used the dimensions to generate three design concepts and presented them in focus groups to further scrutinize findings from Part I. Based on these findings we outline directions for research and design to improve patient-provider communication about patients' personal values.
118,Facilitating Self-reflection about Values and Self-care Among Individuals with Chronic Conditions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Catherine Y. Lim  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute Andrew B. L. Berry  University of Washington Andrea L. Hartzler  University of Washington Tad Hirsch  Northeastern University David S. Carrell  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute Zoë A. Bermet  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute James D. Ralston  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute,Individuals with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) experience the overwhelming burden of treating MCC and frequently disagree with their providers on priorities for care. Aligning self-care with patients' values may improve healthcare for these patients. However  patients' values are not routinely discussed in clinical conversations and patients may not actively share this information with providers. In a qualitative field study  we interviewed 15 patients in their homes to investigate techniques that encourage patients to articulate values  self-care  and how they relate. Study activities facilitated self-reflection on values and self-care and produced varying responses  including: raising consciousness  evolving perspectives  identifying misalignments  and considering changes. We discuss how our findings extend prior work on supporting reflection in HCI and inform the design of tools for improving care for people with MCC.
119,The Continued Prevalence of Dichotomous Inferences at CHI,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Lonni Besançon  Linköping University Pierre Dragicevic  Inria,Dichotomous inference is the classification of statistical evidence as either sufficient or insufficient. It is most commonly done through null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Although predominant  dichotomous inferences have proven to cause countless problems. Thus  an increasing number of methodologists have been urging researchers to recognize the continuous nature of statistical evidence and to ban dichotomous inferences. We wanted to see whether they have had any influence on CHI. Our analysis of CHI proceedings from the past nine years suggests that they have not.
120,How we Guide  Write  and Cite at CHI,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Henning Pohl  University of Copenhagen Aske Mottelson  University of Copenhagen,There are many opinions on how to write an influential CHI paper  ranging from writing in an active voice to including colons in the title. However  little is known about how we actually write  and how writing influences impact. We conducted quantitative analyses of the full text of all 6578 CHI papers published since 1982 to investigate. We looked at readability  titles  novelty  and name-dropping and related these measures to the papers' citation count; overall and for different subcommittees. We found that CHI papers are more readable than papers from other fields. Furthermore  readability  title length  and novelty markers all influence citation counts.
121,We Did It Right  But It Was Still Wrong: Toward Assets-Based Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Lucy Pei  University of California  Irvine Bonnie Nardi  University of California  Irvine,"HCI interventions often fall short of delivering lasting impact in resource-constrained contexts. We reflect on a project where we followed the ""right"" steps of needs-based  human-centered design  yet failed to deliver impact to the community. We introduce a framework that evaluates an intervention's potential for sustainable impact by maximizing use of assets in the community and minimizing novelty. We propose assets-based design as an approach that starts with what a community has  leveraging those assets in a design  as opposed to a needs-based approach that focuses on adding what a community lacks."
122,Bringing Shades of Feminism to Human-Centered Computing,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Manasee Narvilkar  Georgia Institute of Technology Josiah Mangiameli  Georgia Institute of Technology Adriana Alvarado Garcia  Georgia Institute of Technology Azra Ismail  Georgia Institute of Technology Daniel Schiff  Georgia Institute of Technology Danielle Schechter  Georgia Institute of Technology Jordan Chen  Georgia Institute of Technology Karthik Bhat  Georgia Institute of Technology Marisol Wong-Villacres  Georgia Institute of Technology Anusha Vasudeva  Georgia Institute of Technology Aparna Ramesh  Georgia Institute of Technology Michaelanne Dye  Georgia Institute of Technology Naveena Karusala  University of Washington Pragati Singh  Georgia Institute of Technology Savanthi Murthy  Georgia Institute of Technology Shubhangi Gupta  Georgia Institute of Technology Udaya Lakshmi  Georgia Institute of Technology Neha Kumar  Georgia Institute of Technology,This consolidation of 18 stories from students and researchers of human-centered computing (HCC) represent some of the diverse shades of feminism that are present in our field. These stories  our stories  reflect how we see the world and why  also articulating the change we wish to bring.

Sketches are fast  easy to create  and – by varying their fidelity – can be used in all areas of HCI. Sketching in HCI will explore and demonstrate themes around sketching in HCI with the aim of producing tangible outputs. Attendees will leave the course with the confidence to engage actively with sketching on an everyday basis in their research practice.
124,How to Write CHI Papers (Third Edition),Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Lennart E. Nacke  University of Waterloo,We base everything that we do as researchers on what we write. Primarily for graduate students and young researchers  it is hard to turn a research project into a successful CHI publication. This struggle continues for postdocs and young professors trying to author excellent reviews for the CHI community that pinpoint flaws and improvements in research papers. This third edition of the successful CHI paper writing course offers hands-on advice and more in-depth tutorials on how to write papers with clarity  substance  and style. It is structured into three 80-minute units with a focus on writing CHI papers.
125,Making with Fabric: Foundations of Soft Goods and E-Textiles Fabrication,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Lucy E. Dunne  University of Minnesota,Wearable technologies afford more pervasive access to the human user: higher bandwidth for communication in multiple modalities  and better context-awareness through sensing the user's body and environment. However  stand-alone devices like wristbands and clip-ons are limited in the body areas they can simultaneously access. Clothing and textiles provide a useful platform for distributed systems  but present unique challenges in design and fabrication. This course provides an introduction to the tools  methods  and techniques of designing and fabricating with soft goods  including patternmaking and construction techniques for different material types at multiple scales  and e-textile methods and materials.
126,Career Mentoring in Online Communities: Seeking and Receiving Advice from an Online Community,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Maria Tomprou  Carnegie Mellon University Laura Dabbish  Carnegie Mellon University Robert E. Kraut  Carnegie Mellon University Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,Although people frequently seek mentoring or advice for their career  most mentoring is performed in person. Little research has examined the nature and quality of career mentoring online. To address this gap  we study how people use online Q&A forums for career advice. We develop a taxonomy of career advice requests based on a qualitative analysis of posts in a career-related online forum  identifying three key types: best practices  career threats  and time-sensitive requests. Our quantitative analysis of responses shows that both requesters and external viewers value general information  encouragement  and guidance  but not role modeling. We found no relation between the type of requests and features of responses  nor differences in responses valued by requesters versus external viewers. We present design recommendations for supporting online career advice exchange.
127,What Happens After Disclosing Stigmatized Experiences on Identified Social Media: Individual  Dyadic  and Social/Network Outcomes,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Nazanin Andalibi  University of Michigan,Disclosing stigmatized experiences or identity facets on identified social media (e.g.  Facebook) can be risky  inhibited  yet beneficial for the discloser. I investigate such disclosures' outcomes when they do happen on identified social media as perceived by the individuals who perform them. I draw on interviews with women who have experienced pregnancy loss and are social media users in the U.S. I document outcomes at the social/network  individual  and dyad levels. I highlight the powerful role of connecting with others with a similar experience within networks of known ties  how disclosures lead to relationship changes  how disclosers take on new social roles as mentors and support sources  and how helpful connections following disclosures originate from various kinds of ties via diverse communication channels. I emphasize reciprocal disclosures as an outcome contributing to further outcomes (e.g.  destigmatizing pregnancy loss). I provide design implications related to facilitating being a support source and mentor  helpful reciprocal disclosures  and finding similar others within networks of known ties.
128,Communication Breakdowns Between Families and Alexa,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Erin Beneteau  University of Washington Olivia K. Richards  Pennsylvania State University Mingrui Zhang  University of Washington Julie A. Kientz  University of Washington Jason C. Yip  University of Washington Alexis Hiniker  University of Washington,We investigate how families repair communication breakdowns with digital home assistants. We recruited 10 diverse families to use an Amazon Echo Dot in their homes for four weeks. All families had at least one child between four and 17 years old. Each family participated in pre- and post- deployment interviews. Their interactions with the Echo Dot (Alexa) were audio recorded throughout the study. We analyzed 59 communication breakdown interactions between family members and Alexa  framing our analysis with concepts from HCI and speech-language pathology. Our findings indicate that family members collaborate using discourse scaffolding (supportive communication guidance) and a variety of speech and language modifications in their attempts to repair communication breakdowns with Alexa. Alexa's responses also influence the repair strategies that families use. Designers can relieve the communication repair burden that primarily rests with families by increasing digital home assistants' abilities to collaborate together with users to repair communication breakdowns.
129,Nurturing Constructive Disagreement - Agonistic Design with Neurodiverse Children,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Christopher Frauenberger  TU Wien Katta Spiel  TU Wien Laura Scheepmaker  TU Wien Irene Posch  TU Wien,Participatory design (PD) with heterogeneous groups poses particular challenges  requiring spaces in which different agendas or visions can be negotiated. In this paper we report on our PD work with two groups of neurodiverse children to design technologies that support co-located  social play. The heterogeneity in the groups in terms of abilities  conceptions of play  motivations to be involved and individual preferences has challenged us to think of the design process and its outcomes as spaces for continuous negotiation. Drawing on the notion of agonistic PD  we sought not to necessarily reconcile all views  but foster constructive disagreement as a resource for and possible outcome of design. Using our project work as a case study  we report on controversies  big and small  and how they manifested themselves in the processes and outcomes. Reflecting on our experiences  we discuss possible implications on the notion of democratising technology innovation.
130,Development of a Checklist for the Prevention of Intradialytic Hypotension in Hemodialysis Care: Design Considerations Based on Activity Theory,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Pei-Yi Kuo  University of Michigan & National Tsing Hua University Rajiv Saran  University of Michigan Marissa Argentina  National Kidney Foundation Michael Heung  University of Michigan Jennifer L.

Veinot  University of Michigan,"Hemodialysis is life-saving therapy for end-stage renal disease; yet  20% of hemodialysis sessions are complicated by intradialytic hypotension (""IDH""). There is a need for approaches to preventing IDH that account for their implementation contexts. Using Activity Theory  we outline the design of a digital diagnostic checklist to identify patients at risk of IDH. Checklists were chosen a priori as an outcome due to prior evidence of effectiveness. Drawing on individual interviews with 20 clinicians and three focus groups with 17 patients  we describe four activity systems within hemodialysis care. We then outline a novel design process that includes co-design activities with clinicians  and four rapid-cycle iterations that progressively incorporated activity system elements into checklist design. We contribute a new type of checklist design to HCI: one that supports diagnostic thinking rather than consistent task completion. We further broaden checklist design by including a formal role for patients in checklist completion."
131,Comparing the Effects of Paper and Digital Checklists on Team Performance in Time-Critical Work,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Leah Kulp  Drexel University Aleksandra Sarcevic  Drexel University Megan Cheng  Children's National Medical Center Yinan Zheng  Children's National Medical Center Randall S. Burd  Children's National Medical Center,This mixed-methods study examines the effects of a tablet-based checklist system on team performance during a dynamic and safety-critical process of trauma resuscitation. We compared team performance from 47 resuscitations that used a paper checklist to that from 47 cases with a digital checklist to determine if digitizing a checklist led to improvements in task completion rates and in how fast the tasks were initiated for 18 most critical assessment and treatment tasks. We also compared if the checklist compliance increased with the digital design. We found that using the digital checklist led to more frequent completions of the initial airway assessment task but fewer completions of ear and lower extremities exams. We did not observe any significant differences in time to task performance  but found increased compliance with the checklist. Although improvements in team performance with the digital checklist were minor  our findings are important because they showed no adverse effects as a result of the digital checklist introduction. We conclude by discussing the takeaways and implications of these results for effective digitization of medical work.
132,Cognitive Aids in Acute Care: Investigating How Cognitive Aids Affect and Support In-hospital Emergency Teams,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Tobias Grundgeiger  Julius-Maximilians-University Stephan Huber  Julius-Maximilians-University Daniel Reinhardt  Julius-Maximilians-University Andreas Steinisch  University Hospital of Würzburg Oliver Happel  University Hospital of Würzburg Thomas Wurmb  University Hospital of Würzburg,Cognitive aids – artefacts that support a user in the completion of a task at the time – have raised great interest to support healthcare staff during medical emergencies. However  the mechanisms of how cognitive aids support or affect staff remain understudied. We describe the iterative development of a tablet-based cognitive aid application to support in-hospital resuscitation team leaders. We report a summative evaluation of two different versions of the application. Finally  we outline the limitations of current explanations of how cognitive aids work and suggest an approach based on embodied cognition. We discuss how cognitive aids alter the task of the team leader (distributed cognition)  the importance of the present team situation (socially situated)  and the result of the interaction between mind and environment (sensorimotor coupling). Understanding and considering the implications of introducing cognitive aids may help to increase acceptance and effectiveness of cognitive aids and eventually improve patient safety.
133,Human-Centered Tools for Coping with Imperfect Algorithms During Medical Decision-Making,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Carrie J. Cai  Google Brain Emily Reif  Google Brain Narayan Hegde  Google Brain Jason Hipp  Google Brain Been Kim  Google Brain Daniel Smilkov  Google Brain Martin Wattenberg  Google Brain Fernanda Viegas  Google Brain Greg S. Corrado  Google Brain Martin C. Stumpe  Google Brain Michael Terry  Google Brain,Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in image retrieval systems for medical decision making. One application of ML is to retrieve visually similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. However  no algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. In this paper  we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images retrieved using a deep learning algorithm  and developed tools that empower users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly  communicating what types of similarity are most important at different moments in time. In two evaluations with pathologists  we found that these tools increased the diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm. The tools were preferred over a traditional interface  without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. We also observed that users adopted new strategies when using refinement tools  re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying algorithm and to disambiguate ML errors from their own errors. Taken together  these findings inform future human-ML collaborative systems for expert decision-making.
134,(Re-)Framing Menopause Experiences for HCI and Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Jeffrey Bardzell  Indiana University Shaowen Bardzell  Indiana University Amanda Lazar  University of Maryland  College Park Norman Makoto Su  Indiana University,Informed by considerations from medicine and wellness research  experience design  investigations of new and emerging technologies  and sociopolitical critique  HCI researchers have demonstrated that women's health is a complex and rich topic. Turning these research outputs into productive interventions  however  is difficult. We argue that design is well positioned to address such a challenge thanks to its methodological traditions of problem setting and framing situated in synthetic (rather than analytic) knowledge production. In this paper  we focus on designing for experiences of menopause. Building on our prior empirical work on menopause and our commitment to pursue design informed by women's lived experience  we iteratively generated dozens of design frames and accompanying design crits. We document the unfolding of our design reasoning  showing how good-seeming insights nonetheless often lead to bad designs  while working progressively towards stronger insights and design constructs. The latter we offer as a contribution to researchers and practitioners who work at the intersections of women's health and design.
135,Parting the Red Sea: Sociotechnical Systems and Lived Experiences of Menopause,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Amanda Lazar  University of Maryland  College Park Norman Makoto Su  Indiana University Jeffrey Bardzell  Indiana University Shaowen Bardzell  Indiana University,Menopause is a major life change affecting roughly half of the population  resulting in physiological  emotional  and social changes. To understand experiences with menopause holistically  we conducted a study of a subreddit forum. The project was informed by feminist social science methodologies  which center knowledge production on women's lived experiences. Our central finding is that the lived experience of menopause is social: menopause is less about bodily experiences by themselves and more about how experiences with the body become meaningful over time in the social context. We find that gendered marginalization shapes diverse social relationships  leading to widespread feelings of alienation and negative transformation — often expressed in semantically dense figurative language. Research and design can accordingly address menopause not only as a women's health concern  but also as a matter of facilitating social support and a social justice issue.
136,Notjustgirls: Exploring Male-related Eating Disordered Content across Social Media Platforms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Jessica A. Pater  Parkview Research Center & Georgia Institute of Technology Lauren E. Reining  Parkview Research Center Andrew D. Miller  Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Tammy Toscos  Parkview Research Center Elizabeth D. Mynatt  Georgia Institute of Technology,Eating disorders (EDs) are a worldwide public health concern that impact approximately 10% of the U.S. population. Our previous research characterized these behaviors across online spaces. These characterizations have used clinical terminology  and their lexical variants  to identify ED content online. However  previous HCI research on EDs (including our own) suffers from a lack of gender and cultural diversity. In this paper  we designed a follow-up study of online ED characterizations  extending our previous methodologies to focus specifically on male/masculine-related content. We highlight the similarities and differences found in the terminology utilized and media archetypes associated with the social media content. Finally  we discuss other considerations highlighted through our analysis of the male-related content that is missing from the previous research.
137,Psychologically Inclusive Design: Cues Impact Women's Participation in STEM Education,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,René F. Kizilcec  Cornell University Andrew J. Saltarelli  Stanford University,Visual and verbal cues can reinforce barriers to access for women in science  technology  engineering  and math (STEM) disciplines. Psychologically inclusive design is an evidence-based approach to reduce psychological barriers by strategically placing content and design cues in the environment. Two large field experiments provide estimates of the behavioral impact of psychologically inclusive cues on women's and men's enrollment behaviors in an online learning environment. First  a gender-inclusive photo and statement in an online advertisement for a STEM course increased the click-through rate among women but not men by 26% (N=209 000). Second  an inclusivity statement with a gender-inclusive course image to the enrollment page raised the proportion of women enrolling in a STEM course by up to 18% (N=63 000). These findings contribute evidence of the behavioral impact of psychologically inclusive design to the literature and yield practical implications for the presentation of STEM opportunities.

139,Crowdworker Economics in the Gig Economy,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Forth,Jason T. Jacques  University of Cambridge Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge,The nature of work is changing. As labor increasingly trends to casual work in the emerging gig economy  understanding the broader economic context is crucial to effective engagement with a contingent workforce. Crowdsourcing represents an early manifestation of this fluid  laisser-faire  on-demand workforce. This work analyzes the results of four large-scale surveys of US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk workers recorded over a six-year period  providing comparable measures to national statistics. Our results show that despite unemployment far higher than national levels  crowdworkers are seeing positive shifts in employment status and household income. Our most recent surveys indicate a trend away from full-time-equivalent crowdwork  coupled with a reduction in estimated poverty levels to below national figures. These trends are indicative of an increasingly flexible workforce  able to maximize their opportunities in a rapidly changing national labor market  which may have material impacts on existing models of crowdworker behavior.
140,Crowdsourcing Multi-label Audio Annotation Tasks with Citizen Scientists,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Forth,Mark Cartwright  New York University Graham Dove  New York University Ana Elisa Méndez Méndez  New York University Juan Pablo Bello  New York University Oded Nov  New York University,Annotating rich audio data is an essential aspect of training and evaluating machine listening systems. We approach this task in the context of temporally-complex urban soundscapes  which require multiple labels to identify overlapping sound sources. Typically this work is crowdsourced  and previous studies have shown that workers can quickly label audio with binary annotation for single classes. However  this approach can be difficult to scale when multiple passes with different focus classes are required to annotate data with multiple labels. In citizen science  where tasks are often image-based  annotation efforts typically label multiple classes simultaneously in a single pass. This paper describes our data collection on the Zooniverse citizen science platform  comparing the efficiencies of different audio annotation strategies. We compared multiple-pass binary annotation  single-pass multi-label annotation  and a hybrid approach: hierarchical multi-pass multi-label annotation. We discuss our findings  which support using multi-label annotation  with reference to volunteer citizen scientists' motivations.
141,Navigating Ride-Sharing Regulations: How Regulations Changed the 'Gig' of Ride-Sharing for Drivers in Taiwan,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Forth,Anita Chen  Pennsylvania State University Chien Wen (Tina) Yuan  Fu Jen University Ning F. Ma  Pennsylvania State University Chi-Yang Hsu  Pennsylvania State University Benjamin V. Hanrahan  Pennsylvania State University,"Ride-sharing platforms have rapidly spread and disrupted ride hailing markets  resulting in conflicts between ride-sharing and taxi drivers. Taxi drivers claim that their counterparts have unfair advantages in terms of lower prices and a more stable customer base  making it difficult to earn a living. Local government entities have dealt with this disruption and conflict in different ways  often looking towards some form of regulation. While there have been discussions about what the regulation should be  there has been less work looking at what impacts regulations have on ride-sharing drivers and their usage of the platforms. In this paper we present our interview study of ride-sharing drivers in Taiwan  who have gone through three distinct phases of regulation. Drivers felt that regulations legitimized their work  while having to navigate consequences related to regulated access to platforms and fundamental changes to the ""gig'' of ride-sharing."
142,Why Do You Need This? Selective Disclosure of Data Among Citizen Scientists,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Forth,Anna Rudnicka  University College London Anna L. Cox  University College London Sandy J. J. Gould  University of Birmingham,Recent scandals involving data from participatory research have contributed to broader public concern about online privacy. Such concerns might make people more reluctant to participate in research that asks them to volunteer personal data  compromising many researchers' data collection. We tested several motivational messages that encouraged participation in a citizen science project. We measured people's willingness to disclose personal information. While participants were less likely to share sensitive data than neutral data  disclosure behaviour was not affected by attitudes to privacy. Importantly  we found that citizen scientists who were exposed to a motivational message that emphasised 'learning' were more likely to share sensitive information than those presented with other types of motivational cues. Our results suggest that priming individuals with motivational messages can increase their willingness to contribute personal data to a project  even if the request pertains to sensitive information.
143,Understanding Life Transitions: A Case Study of Support Needs of Low-Income Mothers,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Gala,Annu Sible Prabhakar  University of Cincinnati Erik Stolterman Bergqvist  Indiana University Bloomington Selma Šabanović  Indiana University,Life transitions are an integral part of the human experience. However  research shows that lack of support during life transitions can result in adverse health outcomes. To better understand the support needs and structures of low-income women during transition to motherhood  we interviewed 10 women and their 14 supporters during the transition. Our findings suggest that support needs and structures of mothers evolve during transition  and that they also vary by socio-economic contexts. In this paper  we detail our study design and findings. Informed by our findings  we posit that all life-transitions are not the same  and that therefore  the optimal support intervention point varies for different life transitions. Currently there are no tools available to identify optimal support intervention points during life transitions. To this end  we also introduce a preliminary framework - the Strength-Stress-Analysis (SSA) framework - to identify optimal support intervention points during life-transitions.
144,Accessing a New Land: Designing for a Social Conceptualisation of Access,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Gala,Lizzie Coles-Kemp  Royal Holloway University of London Rikke Bjerg Jensen  Royal Holloway University of London,"This paper presents a study of mobile phone use by people settling in a new land to access state provided digital services. It shows that digital literacy and access to technology are not the only resources and capabilities needed to successfully access digital services and do not guarantee a straightforward resettlement process. Using creative engagement methods  the research involved 132 ""newcomers"" seeking to settle in Sweden. Ribot and Peluso's theory of access (2003) was employed to examine the complex web of access experienced by our participants. We uncover that when communities are dealing with high levels of precarity  their primary concerns are related to accessing the benefits of a service  rather than controlling access. Broadening the HCI framework  the paper concludes that a sociotechnical model of access needs to connect access control and access benefit to facilitate the design of an effective digital service."
145,I Bought This for Me to Look More Ordinary: A Study of Blind People Doing Online Shopping,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Gala,Guanhong Liu  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Xianghua Ding  Fudan University Chun Yu  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Lan Gao  Beihang University Xingyu Chi  Kensington Park School Yuanchun Shi  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education,Online shopping  by reducing the needs for traveling  has become an essential part of lives for people with visual impairments. However  in HCI  research on online shopping for them has only been limited to the analysis of accessibility and usability issues. To develop a broader and better understanding of how visually impaired people shop online and design accordingly  we conducted a qualitative study with twenty blind people. Our study highlighted that blind people's desire of being treated as ordinary had significantly shaped their online shopping practices: very attentive to the visual appearance of the goods even they themselves could not see and taking great pain to find and learn what commodities are visually appropriate for them. This paper reports how their trying to appear ordinary is manifested in online shopping and suggests design implications to support these practices.
146,I was really  really nervous posting it: Communicating about Invisible Chronic Illnesses across Social Media Platforms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Gala,Shruti Sannon  Cornell University Elizabeth Murnane  Stanford University Natalya N. Bazarova  Cornell University Geri Gay  Cornell University,People with invisible chronic illnesses (ICIs) can use social media to seek both informational and emotional support  but these individuals also face social and health-related challenges in posting about their often-stigmatized conditions online. To understand how they evaluate different platforms for disclosure  we interviewed 19 people with ICIs who post on general social media about their illnesses  such as Facebook  Instagram  and Twitter. We present a cross-platform analysis of how platforms varied in their suitability to achieve participants' goals  as well as the challenges posed by each platform. We also found that as participants' ICIs progressed  their goals  challenges  and social media use similarly evolved over time. Our findings highlight how people with ICIs select platforms from a broader ecology of social media and suggest a general need to understand shifts in social media use for populations with chronic but changing health concerns.
147,Exploring How Privacy and Security Factor into IoT Device Purchase Behavior,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Pardis Emami-Naeini  Carnegie Mellon University Henry Dixon  Carnegie Mellon University Yuvraj Agarwal  Carnegie Mellon University Lorrie Faith Cranor  Carnegie Mellon University,Despite growing concerns about security and privacy of Internet of Things (IoT) devices  consumers generally do not have access to security and privacy information when purchasing these devices. We interviewed 24 participants about IoT devices they purchased. While most had not considered privacy and security prior to purchase  they reported becoming concerned later due to media reports  opinions shared by friends  or observing unexpected device behavior. Those who sought privacy and security information before purchase  reported that it was difficult or impossible to find. We asked interviewees to rank factors they would consider when purchasing IoT devices; after features and price  privacy and security were ranked among the most important. Finally  we showed interviewees our prototype privacy and security label. Almost all found it to be accessible and useful  encouraging them to incorporate privacy and security in their IoT purchase decisions.
148,Defending My Castle: A Co-Design Study of Privacy Mechanisms for Smart Homes,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Yaxing Yao  Syracuse University Justin Reed Basdeo  Syracuse University Smirity Kaushik  Syracuse University Yang Wang  Syracuse University,"Home is a person's castle  a private and protected space. Internet-connected devices such as locks  cameras  and speakers might make a home ""smarter"" but also raise privacy issues because these devices may constantly and inconspicuously collect  infer or even share information about people in the home. To explore user-centered privacy designs for smart homes  we conducted a co-design study in which we worked closely with diverse groups of participants in creating new designs. This study helps fill the gap in the literature between studying users' privacy concerns and designing privacy tools only by experts. Our participants' privacy designs often relied on simple strategies  such as data localization  disconnection from the Internet  and a private mode. From these designs  we identified six key design factors: data transparency and control  security  safety  usability and user experience  system intelligence  and system modality. We discuss how these factors can guide design for smart home privacy."

Thus  shoulder-surfing is a serious threat. To address this threat  we present the first investigation of shoulder-surfing resistant text password entry on gamepads by (1) identifying the requirements of this context; (2) assessing whether shoulder-surfing resistant authentication schemes proposed in non-gamepad contexts can be viably adapted to meet these requirements; (3) proposing ""Colorwheels""  a novel shoulder-surfing resistant authentication scheme specifically geared towards this context; (4) using two different methodologies proposed in the literature for evaluating shoulder-surfing resistance to compare ""Colorwheels""  on-screen keyboards (the de facto standard in this context)  and an existing shoulder-surfing resistant scheme which we identified during our assessment and adapted for the gamepad context; (5) evaluating all three schemes regarding their usability. Having applied different methodologies to measure shoulder-surfing resistance  we discuss their strengths and pitfalls and derive recommendations for future research."
150,Voice Presentation Attack Detection through Text-Converted Voice Command Analysis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Il-Youp Kwak  Samsung Research Jun Ho Huh  Samsung Research Seung Taek Han  Samsung Research Iljoo Kim  Samsung Research Jiwon Yoon  Korea University,Voice assistants are quickly being upgraded to support advanced  security-critical commands such as unlocking devices  checking emails  and making payments. In this paper  we explore the feasibility of using users' text-converted voice command utterances as classification features to help identify users' genuine commands  and detect suspicious commands. To maintain high detection accuracy  our approach starts with a globally trained attack detection model (immediately available for new users)  and gradually switches to a user-specific model tailored to the utterance patterns of a target user. To evaluate accuracy  we used a real-world voice assistant dataset consisting of about 34.6 million voice commands collected from 2.6 million users. Our evaluation results show that this approach is capable of achieving about 3.4% equal error rate (EER)  detecting 95.7% of attacks when an optimal threshold value is used. As for those who frequently use security-critical (attack-like) commands  we still achieve EER below 5%.
151,Mapping the Margins: Navigating the Ecologies of Domestic Violence Service Provision,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Rosanna Bellini  Newcastle University Angelika Strohmayer  Newcastle University Patrick Olivier  Monash University Clara Crivellaro  Newcastle University,Work addressing the negative impacts of domestic violence on victim-survivors and service providers has slowly been contributing to the HCI discourse. However  work discussing the necessary  pre-emptive steps for researchers to enter these spaces sensitively and considerately  largely remains opaque. Heavily-politicised specialisms that are imbued with conflicting values and practices  such as domestic violence service delivery can be especially difficult to navigate. In this paper  we report on a mixed methods study consisting of interviews  a design dialogue and an ideation workshop with domestic violence service providers to explore the potential of an online service directory to support their work. Through this three-stage research process  we were able to characterise this unique service delivery landscape and identify tensions in services' access  understandings of technologies and working practices. Drawing from our findings  we discuss opportunities for researchers to work with and sustain complex information ecologies in sensitive settings.
152,Technologies for Social Justice: Lessons from Sex Workers on the Front Lines,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Angelika Strohmayer  Newcastle University Jenn Clamen  Stella  l'amie de Maimie Mary Laing  Northumbria University,This paper provides analysis and insight from a collaborative process with a Canadian sex worker rights organization called Stella  l'amie de Maimie  where we reflect on the use of and potential for digital technologies in service delivery. We analyze the Bad Client and Aggressor List – a reporting tool co-produced by sex workers in the community and Stella staff to reduce violence against sex workers. We analyze its current and potential future formats as an artefact for communication  in a context of sex work criminalization and the exclusion of sex workers from traditional routes for reporting violence and accessing governmental systems for justice. This paper addresses a novel aspect of HCI research that relates to digital technologies and social justice. Reflecting on the Bad Client and Aggressor List  we discuss how technologies can interact with justice-oriented service delivery and develop three implications for design.
153,Street-Level Algorithms: A Theory at the Gaps Between Policy and Decisions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Ali Alkhatib  Stanford University Michael S. Bernstein  Stanford University,Errors and biases are earning algorithms increasingly malignant reputations in society. A central challenge is that algorithms must bridge the gap between high-level policy and on-the-ground decisions  making inferences in novel situations where the policy or training data do not readily apply. In this paper  we draw on the theory of street-level bureaucracies  how human bureaucrats such as police and judges interpret policy to make on-the-ground decisions. We present by analogy a theory of street-level algorithms  the algorithms that bridge the gaps between policy and decisions about people in a socio-technical system. We argue that unlike street-level bureaucrats  who reflexively refine their decision criteria as they reason through a novel situation  street-level algorithms at best refine their criteria only after the decision is made. This loop-and-a-half delay results in illogical decisions when handling new or extenuating circumstances. This theory suggests designs for street-level algorithms that draw on historical design patterns for street-level bureaucracies  including mechanisms for self-policing and recourse in the case of error.

In the present work  we introduce a novel approach to address this problem: using psychologically ""embedded'' CAPTCHAs containing stimuli intended to prime positive emotions and mindsets. An exploratory randomized experiment (N = 454 Mechanical Turk workers) tested the impact of eight new CAPTCHA designs implemented on a simulated  politically charged comment thread. Results revealed that the two interventions that were the most successful at activating positive affect also significantly increased the positivity of tone and analytical complexity of argumentation in participants' responses. A focused follow-up experiment (N = 120 Mechanical Turk workers) revealed that exposure to CAPTCHAs featuring image sets previously validated to evoke low-arousal positive emotions significantly increased the positivity of sentiment and the levels of complexity and social connectedness in participants' posts. We offer several explanations for these results and discuss the practical and ethical implications of designing interfaces to influence discourse in online forums."

Lee  New Jersey Institute of Technology Viktoria Pammer-Schindler  Graz University of Technology Amy Ogan  Carnegie Mellon University Joseph Jay Williams  University of Toronto,In this SIG  we propose a gathering of researchers and practitioners thinking about HCI in learning and educational contexts to foster an ongoing Learning and Education community at CHI. With the recent increase in CHI submissions relating to learning (40% more submissions than previous CHI)  this SIG is an opportunity to foster an inclusive dialogue on designing and studying phenomena  tools  and processes related to learning and education. This SIG will bring together researchers  educators  and practitioners with three goals in mind: (1) discussing more inclusive cross-disciplinary perspectives on learning; (2) defining future directions and standards for learning and education contributions in CHI; and (3) building community across research/practice boundaries.
156,Ethical Mediation in UX Practice,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Lomond,Colin M. Gray  Purdue University Shruthi Sai Chivukula  Purdue University,HCI scholars have become increasingly interested in describing the complex nature of UX practice. In parallel  HCI and STS scholars have sought to describe the ethical and value-laden relationship between designers and design outcomes. However  little research describes the ethical engagement of UX practitioners as a form of design complexity  including the multiple mediating factors that impact ethical awareness and decision-making. In this paper  we use a practice-led approach to describe ethical complexity  presenting three varied cases of UX practitioners based onin situ observations and interviews. In each case  we describe salient factors relating to ethical mediation  including organizational practices  self-driven ethical principles  and unique characteristics of specific projects the practitioner is engaged in. Using the concept of mediation from activity theory  we provide a rich account of practitioners' ethical decision making. We propose future work on ethical awareness and design education based on the concept of ethical mediation.
157,An Exploration of Bitcoin Mining Practices: Miners' Trust Challenges and Motivations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Lomond,Irni Eliana Khairuddin  Universiti Teknologi MARA Corina Sas  Lancaster University,Bitcoin blockchain technology is a distributed ledger of nodes authorizing transactions between anonymous parties. Its key actors are miners using computational power to solve mathematical problems for validating transactions. By sharing blockchain's characteristics  mining is a decentralized  transparent and unregulated practice  less explored in HCI  so we know little about miners' motivations and experiences  and how these may impact on different dimensions of trust. This paper reports on interviews with 20 bitcoin miners about their practices and trust challenges. Findings contribute to HCI theories by extending the exploration of blockchain's characteristics relevant to trust with the competitiveness dimension underpinning the social organization of mining. We discuss the risks of collaborative mining due to centralization and dishonest administrators  and conclude with design implications highlighting the need for tools monitoring the distribution of rewards in collaborative mining  tools tracking data centers' authorization and reputation  and tools supporting the development of decentralized pools.
158,Analyzing Value Discovery in Design Decisions Through Ethicography,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Lomond,Shruthi Sai Chivukula  Purdue University Colin M. Gray  Purdue University Jason A. Brier  Purdue University,HCI scholarship is increasingly concerned with the ethical impact of socio-technical systems. Current theoretically driven approaches that engage with ethics generally prescribe only abstract approaches by which designers might consider values in the design process. However  there is little guidance on methods that promote value discovery  which might lead to more specific examples of relevant values in specific design contexts. In this paper  we elaborate a method for value discovery  identifying how values impact the designer's decision making. We demonstrate the use of this method  called Ethicography  in describing value discovery and use throughout the design process. We present analysis of design activity by user experience (UX) design students in two lab protocol conditions  describing specific human values that designers considered for each task  and visualizing the interplay of these values. We identify opportunities for further research  using the Ethicograph method to illustrate value discovery and translation into design solutions.
159,Autonomous Distributed Energy Systems: Problematising the Invisible through Design  Drama and Deliberation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Lomond,Larissa Pschetz  University of Edinburgh Kruakae Pothong  University College London Chris Speed  University of Edinburgh,Technologies such as blockchains  smart contracts and programmable batteries facilitate emerging models of energy distribution  trade and consumption  and generate a considerable number of opportunities for energy markets. However  these developments complicate relationships between stakeholders  disrupting traditional notions of value  control and ownership. Discussing these issues with the public is particularly challenging as energy consumption habits often obscure the competing values and interests that shape stakeholders' relationships. To make such difficult discussions more approachable and examine the missing relational aspect of autonomous energy systems  we combined the design of speculative hairdryers with performance and deliberation. This integrated method of inquiry makes visible the competing values and interests  eliciting people's wishes to negotiate these terms. We argue that the complexity of mediated energy distribution and its convoluted stakeholder relationships requires more sophisticated methods of inquiry to engage people in debates concerning distributed energy systems.

The rapid pace of change leaves some tools and technologies behind. We must focus our attention primarily on current developments. Why look in the rear-view mirror? Some topics that are being actively explored now will soon be of less interest  so career planning benefits from thoughtfully identifying trajectories. To make use of relevant information in other fields you must understand how their terminologies  priorities  and methods evolved. We will cover the history of several HCI fields and discuss opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Software evolved from passively reacting to human input to today's dynamic partnership. In some areas HCI advanced steadily  elsewhere it reached dead ends or seemed to go in circles. Understanding these patterns will prepare you to respond to unexpected developments in years to come. The forces that shaped HCI in computer science  human factors  information systems  information science  and design are covered  with examples and implications for our new era.

Drucker  Microsoft Research Eytan Adar  University of Michigan,Despite the availability of software to support Affinity Diagramming (AD)  practitioners still largely favor physical sticky-notes. Physical notes are easy to set-up  can be moved around in space and offer flexibility when clustering un-structured data. However  when working with mixed data sources such as surveys  designers often trade off the physicality of notes for analytical power. We propose AffinityLens  a mobile-based augmented reality (AR) application for Data-Assisted Affinity Diagramming (DAAD). Our application provides just-in-time quantitative insights overlaid on physical notes. Affinity Lens uses several different types of AR overlays (called lenses) to help users find specific notes  cluster information  and summarize insights from clusters. Through a formative study of AD users  we developed design principles for data-assisted AD and an initial collection of lenses. Based on our prototype  we find that Affinity Lens supports easy switching between qualitative and quantitative 'views' of data  without surrendering the lightweight benefits of existing AD practice.

When documents are presented on digital devices  however  they can provide unique functionality to users  such as the ability to search  view dynamic multimedia content  and make use of indexing. This work explores the fusion of physical and digital paper documents. It first presents the results of a study that probed how users perform document-intensive analytical tasks when both physical and digital versions of documents were available. The study findings then informed the design of HoloDoc  a mixed reality system that augments physical artifacts with rich interaction and dynamic virtual content. Finally  we present the interaction techniques that HoloDoc affords  and the results of a second study that assessed HoloDoc's utility when working with digital and physical copies of academic articles.

Thomas  University of South Australia Mark Billinghurst  University of South Australia,We propose a multi-scale Mixed Reality (MR) collaboration between the Giant  a local Augmented Reality user  and the Miniature  a remote Virtual Reality user  in Giant-Miniature Collaboration (GMC). The Miniature is immersed in a 360-video shared by the Giant who can physically manipulate the Miniature through a tangible interface  a combined 360-camera with a 6 DOF tracker. We implemented a prototype system as a proof of concept and conducted a user study (n=24) comprising of four parts comparing: A) two types of virtual representations  B) three levels of Miniature control  C) three levels of 360-video view dependencies  and D) four 360-camera placement positions on the Giant. The results show users prefer a shoulder mounted camera view  while a view frustum with a complimentary avatar is a good visualization for the Miniature virtual representation. From the results  we give design recommendations and demonstrate an example Giant-Miniature Interaction.
166,DMove: Directional Motion-based Interaction for Augmented Reality Head-Mounted Displays,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Wenge Xu  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Hai-Ning Liang  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Yuxuan Zhao  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Difeng Yu  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Diego Monteiro  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,We present DMove  directional motion-based interaction for Augmented Reality (AR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) that is both hands- and device-free. It uses directional walk-ing as a way to interact with virtual objects. To use DMove  a user needs to perform directional motions such as mov-ing one foot forward or backward. In this research  we first investigate the recognition accuracy of the motion direc-tions of our method and the social acceptance of this type of interactions together with users' comfort rating for each direction. We then optimize its design and conduct a sec-ond study to compare DMove in task performance and user preferences (workload  motion sickness  user experience)  with two approaches—Hand interaction (Meta 2-like) and Head+Hand interaction (HoloLens-like) for menu selection tasks. Based on the results of these two studies  we provide a set of guidelines for DMove and further demonstrate two applications that utilize directional motions.
167,Spaces and Traces: Implications of Smart Technology in Public Housing,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Sandjar Kozubaev  Georgia Institute of Technology Fernando Rochaix  Georgia Statue University Carl DiSalvo  Georgia Institute of Technology Christopher A. Le Dantec  Georgia Institute of Technology,Smart home technologies are beginning to become more widespread and common  even as their deployment and implementation remain complex and spread across different competing commercial ecosystems. Looking beyond the middle-class  single-family home often at the center of the smart home narrative  we report on a series of participatory design workshops held with residents and building managers to better understand the role of smart home technologies in the context of public housing in the U.S. The design workshops enabled us to gather insight into the specific challenges and opportunities of deploying smart home technologies in a setting where issues of privacy  data collection and ownership  and autonomy collide with diverse living arrangements  where income  age  and the consequences of monitoring and data aggregation setup an expanding collection of design implications in the ecosystems of smart home technologies.
168,My Naturewatch Camera: Disseminating Practice Research with a Cheap and Easy DIY Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,William Gaver  Goldsmiths  University of London Andy Boucher  Goldsmiths  University of London Michail Vanis  Goldsmiths  University of London Andy Sheen  Goldsmiths  University of London Dean Brown  Goldsmiths  University of London Liliana Ovalle  Goldsmiths  University of London Naho Matsuda  Goldsmiths  University of London Amina Abbas-Nazari  Royal College of Art Robert Phillips  Royal College of Art,My Naturewatch Camera is an inexpensive wildlife camera that we designed for people to make themselves as a way of promoting engagement with nature and digital making. We aligned its development to the interests of the BBC's Natural History Unit as part of an orchestrated engagement strategy also involving our project website and outreach to social media. Since June 2018  when the BBC featured the camera on one of their Springwatch 2018 broadcasts  over 1000 My Naturewatch Cameras have been constructed using instructions and software from our project website and commercially available components  without direct contact with our studio. In this paper  we describe the project and outcomes with a focus on its success in promoting engagement with nature  engagement with digital making  and the effectiveness of this strategy for sharing research products outside traditional commercial channels.
169,Life-Affirming Biosensing in Public: Sounding Heartbeats on a Red Bench,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Noura Howell  University of California  Berkeley Greg Niemeyer  University of California  Berkeley Kimiko Ryokai  University of California  Berkeley,"Smart city narratives promise IoT data-driven innovations leveraging biosensing technologies. We argue this overlooks a potential benefit of city living: affirmation. We designed the Heart Sounds Bench  which amplifies the heart sounds of those sitting on it  as well as recording and playing back the heart sounds of previous sitters. We outline our design intent to invite rest  reflection  and recognition of others' lives in public space. We share results from a study with 19 participants. Participants expressed feeling connected to a shared life energy including others and the environment  and described heart sounds as feeling intimate yet anonymous. Finally  we elaborate the concept of life-affirmation in terms of recognition of others' lives  feeling connection  and respecting untranslatable differences with opacity  as a way of helping ""smart city"" designs embrace a multiplicity of desires."
170,City Explorer: The Design and Evaluation of a Location-Based Community Information System,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Carolyn Pang  Simon Fraser University Rui Pan  Simon Fraser University Carman Neustaedter  Simon Fraser University Kate Hennessy  Simon Fraser University,Many working professionals commute via public transit  yet they have limited tools for learning about their urban neighborhoods and fellow commuters. We designed a location-based game called City Explorer to investigate how transit commuters capture  share  and view community information that is specifically tied to locations. Through a four-week field study  we found that participants valued the increased awareness of their personal travel routines that they gained through City Explorer. When viewing community information  they preferred information that was factual rather than opinion-based and was presented at the start and end of their commutes. Participants found less value in connecting with other transit riders because transit rides were often seen as opportunities to disengage from others. We discuss how location-based technologies can be designed to display factual community information before  during  and at the end of transit commutes.
171,Participatory Design of a Virtual Reality-Based Reentry Training with a Women's Prison,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Melissa Qingqing Teng  Emerson College James Hodge  Newcastle University Eric Gordon  Emerson College,This study examines the participatory design process of a virtual reality (VR) reentry training program with a women's prison. Conceptually drawing on previous work in VR exposure training  this prototype consists of guided  first-person 3D-360° video episodes that depict psychologically stressful situations that women commonly face when returning home. Critical story and production elements  including screenplay  acting  and narration  were created with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women. The institutional  technological  and cultural restrictions of prison  combined with the tensions of making media with often exploited groups  forced adaptations of participatory design methods. The inclusion of incarcerated female voices resulted in an immersive narrative that reflects this group's specific challenges. The next phase is to evaluate its efficacy against non-immersive comparative trainings for reentry-related anxieties.
172,A Change of Perspective: Designing the Automated Vehicle as a New Social Actor in a Public Space,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Lenja Sorokin  BMW Group Ronee Chadowitz  BMW Group Nina Kauffmann  BMW Group,With the rise of automated vehicles  a new road user had to be designed  an autonomous system that needs to integrate into an ecosystem of human-human interaction. Traditionally automotive UX is focused on the interaction between the driver and the vehicle. This new design challenge however comprised a change of perspective from driver/inside to road user/outside and from a system that is steered by a human being to an intelligent system that proactively makes decisions in a public space. A new approach was necessary to handle this change of perspective in the design process and to instill it into the heads of the stakeholders. We modified a user centered process to satisfy the challenge of designing the automated vehicle as a social actor. For example  we designed for acceptance by defining a character based on hopes and concerns of the public. The flow of communication was analyzed and intent based visual and acoustic signals were designed and evaluated in a purpose-built simulator. The lessons we learned from this process might also be applicable to the design of other autonomous  public facing systems.
173,Understanding Abusive Behaviour Between Online and Offline Group Discussions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Abdulwhab Alkharashi  University of Glasgow Tim Storer  University of Glasgow Joemon Jose  University of Glasgow Andrew Hoskins  University of Glasgow Catherine Happer  University of Glasgow,Online discussion platforms can face multiple challenges of abusive behaviour. In order to understand the reasons for persisting such behaviour  we need to understand how users behave inside and outside a community. In this paper  we propose a novel methodology to generate a dataset from offline and online group discussion conversations. We advocate an empirical-based approach to explore the space of abusive behaviour. We conducted a user-study (N = 15) to understand what factors facilitate or amplify forms of behaviour in cases of online conversation that are less likely to be tolerated in face-to-face. The preliminary analysis validates our approach to analyse large-scale conversation dataset.
174,Lab Hackathons to Overcome Laboratory Equipment Shortages in Africa: Opportunities and Challenges,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Helena Webb  University of Oxford Jason R.C. Nurse  University of Kent Louise Bezuidenhout  University of Oxford Marina Jirotka  University of Oxford,Equipment shortages in Africa undermine Science  Technology  Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education. We have pioneered the LabHackathon (LabHack): a novel initiative that adapts the conventional hackathon and draws on insights from the Open Hardware movement and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). LabHacks are fun  educational events that challenge student participants to build frugal and reproducible pieces of laboratory equipment. Completed designs are then made available to others. LabHacks can therefore facilitate the open and sustainable design of laboratory equipment  in situ  in Africa. In this case study we describe the LabHackathon model  discuss its application in a pilot event held in Zimbabwe and outline the opportunities and challenges it presents.

177,Beautiful Seams: Strategic Revelations and Concealments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Sarah Inman  University of Washington David Ribes  University of Washington,This paper tracks a debate that occurred  first  within the field of Ubiquitous Computing but quickly spread to CHI and beyond  in which design scholars argued that seamlessness had long been an implicit and privileged design virtue  often at the expense of seamfulness. Seamless design emphasizes clarity  simplicity  ease of use  and consistency to facilitate technological interaction. Seamful design emphasizes configurability  user appropriation  and revelation of complexity  ambiguity or inconsistency. Here we review these literatures together and argue that  rather than rival approaches  seamful and seamless design are complements  each emphasizing different aspects of downstream user agency. Ultimately  we situate this debate within the larger  perennial discussion about the strategic revelation and concealment of human and technological operations  and therein the role of design.
178,Designing for the Infrastructure of the Supply Chain of Malay Handwoven Songket in Terengganu,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Min Zhang  Lancaster University Corina Sas  Lancaster University Zoe Lambert  Lancaster University Masitah Ahmad  Universiti Teknologi MARA,The growing HCI interest in developing contexts and cultural craft practices is ripe to focus on their under-explored homegrown sociotechnical infrastructures. This paper explores the creative infrastructural actions embedded within the practices of songket's supply chain in Terengganu  Malaysia. We report on contextual interviews with 92 participants including preparation workers  weavers  designers  merchants  and customers. Findings indicate that increased creative infrastructural actions are reflected in these actors' resourcefulness for mobilizing information  materials  and equipment  and for making creative artifacts through new technologies weaved within traditional practices. We propose two novel approaches to design in this craft-based infrastructure. First  we explore designing for the social layer of infrastructure and its mutually advantageous exploitative relationships rooted in culture and traditions. Second  we suggest designing for roaming value-creation artifacts  which blend physical and digital materializations of songket textile design. Developed through a collaborative and asynchronous process  we argue that these artifacts represent less-explored vehicles for value co-creation  and that sociotechnical infrastructures as emerging sites of innovation could benefit from HCI research.
179,Multi-plié: A Linear Foldable and Flattenable Interactive Display to Support Efficiency  Safety and Collaboration,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Sylvain Pauchet  University of Toulouse - ENAC & Astrolab Jean-Luc Vinot  University of Toulouse - ENAC Catherine Letondal  University of Toulouse - ENAC Alexandre Lemort  Ingenuity i/o Claire Lavenir  Intactile Design Timothée Lecomte  University of Toulouse - ENAC Stéphanie Rey  Berger-Levrault Valentin Becquet  University of Toulouse - ENAC Guillaume Crouzet  University of Toulouse - ENAC,We present the design concept of an accordion-fold interactive display to address the limits of touch-based interaction in airliner cockpits. Based on an analysis of pilot activity  tangible design principles for this design concept are identified. Two resulting functional prototypes are explored during participatory workshops with pilots  using activity scenarios. This exploration validated the design concept by revealing its ability to match pilot responsibilities in terms of safety  efficiency and collaboration. It provides an efficient visual perception of the system for real-time collaborative operations and tangible interaction to strengthen the perception of action and to manage safety through anticipation and awareness. The design work and insights enabled to specify further our needs regarding flexible screens. They also helped to better characterize the design concept as based on continuity of a developed surface  predictability of aligned folds and pleat face roles  embodied interactive properties  and flexibility through affordable reconfigurations.
180,FiberWire: Embedding Electronic Function into 3D Printed Mechanically Strong  Lightweight Carbon Fiber Composite Objects,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Saiganesh Swaminathan  Carnegie Mellon University Kadri Bugra Ozutemiz  Carnegie Mellon University Carmel Majidi  Carnegie Mellon University Scott Hudson  Carnegie Mellon University,3D printing offers significant potential in creating highly customized interactive and functional objects. However  at present ability to manufacture functional objects is limited by available materials (e.g.  various polymers) and their process properties. For instance  many functional objects need stronger materials which may be satisfied with metal printers. However  to create wholly interactive devices  we need both conductors and insulators to create wiring  and electronic components to complete circuits. Unfortunately  the single material nature of metal printing  and its inherent high temperatures  preclude this. Thus  in 3D printed devices  we have had a choice of strong materials  or embedded interactivity  but not both. In this paper  we introduce a set of techniques we call FiberWire  which leverages a new commercially available capability to 3D print carbon fiber composite objects. These objects are light weight and mechanically strong  and our techniques demonstrate a means to embed circuitry for interactive devices within them. With FiberWire  we describe a fabrication pipeline takes advantage of laser etching and fiber printing between layers of carbon-fiber composite to form low resistance conductors  thereby enabling the fabrication of electronics directly embedded into mechanically strong objects. Utilizing the fabrication pipeline  we show a range of sensor designs  their performance characterization on these new materials and finally three fully printed example object that are both interactive and mechanically strong -- a bicycle handle bar with interactive controls  a swing and impact sensing golf club and an interactive game controller (Figure 1).
181,Sensory Alignment in Immersive Entertainment,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Joe Marshall  University of Nottingham Steve Benford  University of Nottingham Richard Byrne  RMIT University Paul Tennent  University of Nottingham,When we use digital systems to stimulate the senses  we typically stimulate only a subset of users' senses  leaving other senses stimulated by the physical world. This creates potential for misalignment between senses  where digital and physical stimulation give conflicting signals to users. We synthesize knowledge from HCI  traditional entertainments  and underlying sensory science research relating to how senses work when given conflicting signals. Using this knowledge we present a design dimension of sensory alignment  and show how this dimension presents opportunities for a range of creative strategies ranging from full alignment of sensory stimulation  up to extreme conflict between senses.
182,A Framework for the Experience of Meaning in Human-Computer Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Elisa D. Mekler  University of Basel Kasper Hornbæk  University of Copenhagen,The view of quality in human-computer interaction continuously develops  having in past decades included consistency  transparency  usability  and positive emotions. Recently  meaning is receiving increased interest in the user experience literature and in industry  referring to the end  purpose or significance of interaction with computers. However  the notion of meaning remains elusive and a bewildering number of senses are in use. We present a framework of meaning in interaction  based on a synthesis of psychological meaning research. The framework outlines five distinct senses of the experience of meaning: connectedness  purpose  coherence  resonance  and significance. We illustrate the usefulness of the framework by analyzing a selection of recent papers at the CHI conference and by raising a series of open research questions about the interplay of meaning  user experience  reflection  and well-being.
183,Understanding the Impact of Information Representation on Willingness to Share Information,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Stefan Schneegass  University of Duisburg-Essen Romina Poguntke  University of Stuttgart Tonja Machulla  LMU Munich,Since the release of the first activity tracker  there has been a steady increase in the number of sensors embedded in wearable devices and with it in the amount and diversity of information that can be derived from these sensors. This development leads to novel privacy threats for users. In a web survey with 248 participants  we explored whether users' willingness to share private data is dependent on how the data is requested by an application. Specifically  requests can be formulated as access to sensor data or as access to information derived from the sensor data (e.g.  accelerometer vs. sleep quality). We show that non-expert users lack an understanding of how the two representation levels relate to each other. The results suggest that the willingness to share sensor data over derived information is governed by whether the derived information has positive or negative connotations (e.g.  training intensity vs. life expectancy). Using the results of the survey  we derive implications for supporting users in protecting their private data collected via wearable sensors.
184,Making Sense of Human-Food Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Ferran Altarriba Bertran  University of California  Santa Cruz Samvid Jhaveri  University of California  Santa Cruz Rosa Lutz  University of California  Santa Cruz Katherine Isbister  University of California  Santa Cruz Danielle Wilde  University of Southern Denmark,Activity in Human-Food Interaction (HFI) research is skyrocketing across a broad range of disciplinary interests and concerns. The dynamic and heterogeneous nature of this emerging field presents a challenge to scholars wishing to critically engage with prior work  identify gaps and ensure impact. It also challenges the formation of community. We present a Systematic Mapping Study of HFI research and an online data visualisation tool developed to respond to these issues. The tool allows researchers to engage in new ways with the HFI literature  propose modifications and additions to the review  and thereby actively engage in community-making. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we characterize the state of HFI  reporting trends  challenges and opportunities; (2) we provide a taxonomy and tool for diffractive reading of the literature; and (3) we offer our approach for adaptation by research fields facing similar challenges  positing value of the tool and approach beyond HFI.
185,Communication Cost of Single-user Gesturing Tool in Laparoscopic Surgical Training,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Yuanyuan Feng  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Katie Li  Pomona College Azin Semsar  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Hannah McGowan  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Jacqueline Mun  Vassar College H. Reza Zahiri  Anne Arundel Medical Center Ivan George  Johns Hopkins University Adrian Park  Anne Arundel Medical Center Andrea Kleinsmith  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Helena M. Mentis  University of Maryland  Baltimore County,Multi-user input over a shared display has been shown to support group process and improve performance. However  current gesturing systems for instructional collaborative tasks limit the input to experts and overlook the needs of novices in making references on a shared display. In this paper  we investigate the effects of a single-user gesturing tool on the communication between trainer and trainees in a laparoscopic surgical training. By comparing the communication structure and content between the trainings with and without the gesturing tool  we show that the communication becomes more imbalanced and the trainees become less active when using the single-user gesturing tool. Our findings highlight the needs to grant all parties the same level of access to a shared display and suggest further directions in designing a shared display for instructional collaborative tasks.
186,An Autonomy-Perspective on the Design of Assistive Technology Experiences of People with Multiple Sclerosis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Florian Güldenpfennig  New Design University and Technische Universität Wien Peter Mayer  Technische Universität Wien Paul Panek  Technische Universität Wien Geraldine Fitzpatrick  Technische Universität Wien,In HCI and Assistive Technology design  autonomy is regularly equated with independence. This is a shortcut and leaves out design opportunities by omitting a more nuanced idea of autonomy. To improve our understanding of how people with severe physical disabilities experience autonomy  particularly in the context of Assistive Technologies  we engaged in in-depth fieldwork with 15 people with Multiple Sclerosis who were used to assistive devices. We constructed a grounded theory from a series of interviews  focus groups and observations  pointing to strategies in which participants sought autonomy either in the short-term (managing their daily energy reserve) or in the long-term (making future plans). The theory shows how factors like enabling technologies  capital (human  social  psychological resources)  and compatibility with daily practices facilitated a sense of being in control for our participants. Moreover  we show how over-ambitious or bad design (e.g.  paternalism) can lead to opposite results and restrict autonomy.
187,Exploring the Opportunities for Technologies to Enhance Quality of Life with People who have Experienced Vision Loss,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Rachel Bartlett  University of Iowa Yi Xuan Khoo  University of Iowa Juan Pablo Hourcade  University of Iowa Kyle K. Rector  University of Iowa,Research predicts that 196 million people will be diagnosed with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) by 2020. People who experience AMD and other vision loss face barriers that affect their Quality of Life (QoL). People experience only modest improvement from technologies (e.g.  screen readers  CCTV)  tools (e.g.  magnifying glasses  tactile buttons)  and human help (e.g.  friends  blindness organizations). Further  there are issues to accessing these resources based on one's place of residence. To explore these challenges and determine design implications to support people who have experienced vision loss (PVL)  we conducted a qualitative semi-structured interview study exploring QoL with 10 PVL. We uncovered themes of supporting creative work  recognizing the impact of one's living in a non-urban setting on QoL  and increasing efficiency at accomplishing tasks. We motivate the inclusion of PVL in the design process because they learned skills while sighted and are now low vision or blind.
188,Seekers  Providers  Welcomers  and Storytellers: Modeling Social Roles in Online Health Communities,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Diyi Yang  Carnegie Mellon University Robert E. Kraut  Carnegie Mellon University Tenbroeck Smith  American Cancer Society  Inc. Elijah Mayfield  Carnegie Mellon University Dan Jurafsky  Stanford University,Participants in online communities often enact different roles when participating in their communities. For example  some in cancer support communities specialize in providing disease-related information or socializing new members. This work clusters the behavioral patterns of users of a cancer support community into specific functional roles. Based on a series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations  this research identified eleven roles that members occupy  such as welcomer and story sharer. We investigated role dynamics  including how roles change over members' lifecycles  and how roles predict long-term participation in the community. We found that members frequently change roles over their history  from ones that seek resources to ones offering help  while the distribution of roles is stable over the community's history. Adopting certain roles early on predicts members' continued participation in the community. Our methodology will be useful for facilitating better use of members' skills and interests in support of community-building efforts.
189,Augmenting Couples' Communication with Lifelines: Shared Timelines of Mixed Contextual Information,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Carla F. Griggio  University Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria & Université Paris-Saclay Midas Nouwens  Aarhus University & University Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay Joanna McGrenere  University of British Columbia & University Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay Wendy E. Mackay  Inria & Université Paris-Saclay,Couples exhibit special communication practices  but apps rarely offer couple-specific functionality. Research shows that sharing streams of contextual information (e.g. location  motion) helps couples coordinate and feel more connected. Most studies explored a single  ephemeral stream; we study how couples' communication changes when sharing multiple  persistent streams. We designed Lifelines  a mobile-app technology probe that visualizes up to six streams on a shared timeline: closeness to home  battery level  steps  media playing  texts and calls. A month-long study with nine couples showed that partners interpreted information mostly from individual streams  but also combined them for more nuanced interpretations. Persistent streams allowed missing data to become meaningful and provided new ways of understanding each other. Unexpected patterns from any stream can trigger calls and texts  whereas seeing expected data can replace direct communication  which may improve or disrupt established communication practices. We conclude with design implications for mediating awareness within couples.
190,Understanding Digitally-Mediated Empathy: An Exploration of Visual  Narrative  and Biosensory Informational Cues,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Max T. Curran  University of California  Berkeley Jeremy Raboff Gordon  University of California  Berkeley Lily Lin  University of California  Berkeley Priyashri Kamlesh Sridhar  Singapore University of Technology and Design John Chuang  University of California  Berkeley,"Digitally sharing our experiences engages a process of empathy shaped by available informational cues. Biosensory data is one informative cue  but the relationship to empathy is underexplored. In this study  we investigate this process by showing a video of a ""target'' person's visual perspective watching a virtual reality film to sixty ""observers''. We vary information available to observers via three experimental conditions: a baseline unmodified video  video with narrative text  or with a graph of electrodermal activity (EDA) of the target. Compared to baseline  narrative text increased empathic accuracy (EA) while EDA had an opposite  negative effect. Qualitatively  observers describe their empathic processes as using their own feelings supplemented with the information presented depending on the interpretability of that information. Both narration and EDA prompted observers to reconsider assumptions about another's experience. Our findings lead to a discussion of digitally-mediated empathy with implications for associated research and product development."
191,Reveal: Investigating Proactive Location-Based Reminiscing with Personal Digital Photo Repositories,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 2,David McGookin  Aalto University,Recording experiences and memories is an important role for digital photography  with smartphone cameras leading to individuals taking increasing numbers of pictures of everyday experiences. Increasingly  these are automatically stored in personal  cloud-backed  photo repositories. However  such experiences can be forgotten quickly  with images 'lost' within the user's library  loosing their role in supporting reminiscing. We investigate how users might be provoked to view these images and the benefits they bring through the development and evaluation of a proactive  location-based reminiscing tool  called Reveal. We outline how a location-based approach allowed participants to reflect more widely on their photo practice  and the potential of such reminiscing tools to support effective management and curation of individual's increasingly large personal photo collections.
192,Emotional Utility and Recall of the Facebook News Feed,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Pawarat Nontasil  University of Bath Stephen J. Payne  University of Bath,We report a laboratory study (N=53) in which participants browsed their own Facebook news feeds for 10-15 minutes  choosing exactly when to quit  and later rated the overall emotional utility of the episode before attempting to recall threads. Finally  the emotional utility of each encountered thread was rated while looking over a recording of the interaction. We report that Facebook browsing was  overall  an emotionally positive experience; that recall of threads exhibited classic primacy and recency serial order effects; that recalled threads were both more positive and more valenced (less neutral) on average  than forgotten threads; and that overall emotional valence judgments were predicted  statistically  by the peak and end thread judgments. We find no evidence that local quit decisions were driven by the emotional utility of threads. In the light of these findings  we discuss the suggestion that emotional utility might partly explain the attractiveness of reading the news feed  and that an emotional memory bias might further increase the attractiveness of the newsfeed in prospect.
193,Sketching in HCI: Hands-on Course of Sketching Techniques,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,Makayla Lewis  Brunel University London Miriam Sturdee  University of Calgary Nicolai Marquardt  University College London,Freehand sketching is a valuable process  input  output  and tool  often used by people to communicate and express ideas  as well as document  explore and describe concepts between researcher  user  or client. Sketches are fast  easy to create  and – by varying their fidelity – can be used in all areas of HCI. Sketching in HCI will explore and demonstrate themes around sketching in HCI with the aim of producing tangible outputs. Attendees will leave the course with the confidence to engage actively with sketching on an everyday basis in their research practice.
194,How to Write CHI Papers (Third Edition),Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Lennart E. Nacke  University of Waterloo,We base everything that we do as researchers on what we write. Primarily for graduate students and young researchers  it is hard to turn a research project into a successful CHI publication. This struggle continues for postdocs and young professors trying to author excellent reviews for the CHI community that pinpoint flaws and improvements in research papers. This third edition of the successful CHI paper writing course offers hands-on advice and more in-depth tutorials on how to write papers with clarity  substance  and style. It is structured into three 80-minute units with a focus on writing CHI papers.
195,Professional Presentation Training: Improve the User Experience of your CHI Presentation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Ash Brown  Bloomberg L.P.

196,Preemptive Action: Accelerating Human Reaction using Electrical Muscle Stimulation Without Compromising Agency,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Shunichi Kasahara  Sony CSL & University of Tokyo Jun Nishida  University of Chicago Pedro Lopes  University of Chicago,We enable preemptive force-feedback systems to speed up human reaction time without fully compromising the user's sense of agency. Typically these interfaces actuate by means of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) or mechanical actuators; they preemptively move the user to perform a task  such as to improve movement performance (e.g.  EMS-assisted drumming). Unfortunately  when using preemptive force-feedback users do not feel in control and loose their sense of agency. We address this by actuating the user's body  using EMS  within a particular time window (160 ms after visual stimulus)  which we found to speed up reaction time by 80 ms in our first study. With this preemptive timing  when the user and system move congruently  the user feels that they initiated the motion  yet their reaction time is faster than usual. As our second study demonstrated  this particular timing significantly increased agency when compared to the current practice in EMS-based devices. We conclude by illustrating  using examples from the HCI literature  how to leverage our findings to provide more agency to automated haptic interfaces.
197,ChewIt. An Intraoral Interface for Discreet Interactions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Pablo Gallego Cascón  The University of Auckland Denys J.C. Matthies  Auckland Bioengineering Institute Sachith Muthukumarana  The University of Auckland Suranga Nanayakkara  Auckland Bioengineering Institute  The University of Auckland,Sensing interfaces relying on head or facial gestures provide effective solutions for hands-free scenarios. Most of these interfaces utilize sensors attached to the face  as well as into the mouth  being either obtrusive or limited in input bandwidth. In this paper  we propose ChewIt -- a novel intraoral input interface. ChewIt resembles an edible object that allows users to perform various hands-free input operations  both simply and discreetly. Our design is informed by a series of studies investigating the implications of shape  size  locations for comfort  discreetness  maneuverability  and obstructiveness. Additionally  we evaluated potential gestures that users could use to interact with such an intraoral interface.
198,Clench Interface: Novel Biting Input Techniques,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Xuhai Xu  University of Washington & Tsinghua University Chun Yu  Tsinghua University Anind K. Dey  University of Washington Jennifer Mankoff  University of Washington,People eat every day and biting is one of the most fundamental and natural actions that they perform on a daily basis. Existing work has explored tooth click location and jaw movement as input techniques  however clenching has the potential to add control to this input channel. We propose clench interaction that leverages clenching as an actively controlled physiological signal that can facilitate interactions. We conducted a user study to investigate users' ability to control their clench force. We found that users can easily discriminate three force levels  and that they can quickly confirm actions by unclenching (quick release). We developed a design space for clench interaction based on the results and investigated the usability of the clench interface. Participants preferred the clench over baselines and indicated a willingness to use clench-based interactions. This novel technique can provide an additional input method in cases where users' eyes or hands are busy  augment immersive experiences such as virtual/augmented reality  and assist individuals with disabilities.
199,Interferi: Gesture Sensing using On-Body Acoustic Interferometry,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Yasha Iravantchi  Carnegie Mellon University Yang Zhang  Carnegie Mellon University Evi Bernitsas  Carnegie Mellon University Mayank Goel  Carnegie Mellon University Chris Harrison  Carnegie Mellon University,Interferi is an on-body gesture sensing technique using acoustic interferometry. We use ultrasonic transducers resting on the skin to create acoustic interference patterns inside the wearer's body  which interact with anatomical features in complex  yet characteristic ways. We focus on two areas of the body with great expressive power: the hands and face. For each  we built and tested a series of worn sensor configurations  which we used to identify useful transducer arrangements and machine learning fea-tures. We created final prototypes for the hand and face  which our study results show can support eleven- and nine-class gestures sets at 93.4% and 89.0% accuracy  re-spectively. We also evaluated our system in four continu-ous tracking tasks  including smile intensity and weight estimation  which never exceed 9.5% error. We believe these results show great promise and illuminate an inter-esting sensing technique for HCI applications.
200,Printer Pals: Experience-Centered Design to Support Agency for People with Dementia,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Sarah Foley  University College Cork Daniel Welsh  Newcastle University Nadia Pantidi  University College Cork Kellie Morrissey  Newcastle University Thomas Nappey  Newcastle University John McCarthy  University College Cork,Whereas there have been significant improvements in the quality of care provided for people with dementia  limited attention to the importance for people with dementia being enabled to make positive social contributions within care home contexts can restrict their sense of agency. In this paper we describe the design and deployment of 'Printer Pals' a receipt-based print media device  which encourages social contribution and agency within a care home environment. The design followed a two-year ethnography  from which the need for highlighting participation and supporting agency for residents within the care home became clear. The residents use of Printer Pals mediated participation in a number of different ways  such as engaging with the technology itself  offering shared experiences and participating in co-constructive and meaningful ways  each of which is discussed. We conclude with a series of design consideration to support agentic and caring interactions through inclusive design practices.
201,Towards Enabling Blind People to Independently Write on Printed Forms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Shirin Feiz  Stony Brook University Syed Masum Billah  Stony Brook University Vikas Ashok  Stony Brook University Roy Shilkrot  Stony Brook University IV Ramakrishnan  Stony Brook University,Filling out printed forms (e.g.  checks) independently is currently impossible for blind people  since they cannot pinpoint the locations of the form fields  and quite often  they cannot even figure out what fields (e.g.  name) are present in the form. Hence  they always depend on sighted people to write on their behalf  and help them affix their signatures. Extant assistive technologies have exclusively focused on reading  with no support for writing. In this paper  we introduce WiYG  a Write-it-Yourself guide that directs a blind user to the different form fields  so that she can independently fill out these fields without seeking assistance from a sighted person. Specifically  WiYG uses a pocket-sized custom 3D printed smartphone attachment  and well-established computer vision algorithms to dynamically generate audio instructions that guide the user to the different form fields. A user study with 13 blind participants showed that with WiYG  users could correctly fill out the form fields at the right locations with an accuracy as high as 89.5%.
202,ALAP: Accessible LaTeX Based Mathematical Document Authoring and Presentation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Ahtsham Manzoor  Lahore University of Management Sciences Safa Arooj  Lahore University of Management Sciences Shaban Zulfiqar  Lahore University of Management Sciences Murayyiam Parvez  Lahore University of Management Sciences Suleman Shahid  Lahore University of Management Sciences Asim Karim  Lahore University of Management Sciences,Assistive technologies such as screen readers and text editors have been used in past to improve the accessibility and authoring of scientific and mathematical documents. However  most screens readers fail to narrate complex mathematical notations and expressions as they skip symbols and necessary information required for the accurate narration of mathematical content. This study aims at evaluating a new Accessible LaTeX Based Mathematical Document Authoring and Presentation (ALAP) tool  which assist people with visual impairments in reading and writing mathematical documents. ALAP includes features like  assistive debugging  Math Mode for reading and writing mathematical notations  and automatic generation of an accessible PDF document. These features aim to improve the LaTeX debugging experience and make it simple for blind users to author mathematical content by narrating it in natural language through the use of integrated text to speech (TTS) engine. We evaluated ALAP by conducting a study with 18 visually impaired LaTeX users. The results showed that users preferred ALAP over another comparable LaTeX based authoring tool and were relatively more comfortable in completing the tasks while using ALAP.
203,Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Shaomei Wu  Facebook Lindsay Reynolds  Facebook Xian Li  Facebook Francisco Guzmán  Facebook,People with dyslexia face challenges expressing themselves in writing on social networking sites (SNSs). Such challenges come from not only the technicality of writing  but also the self-representation aspect of sharing and communicating publicly on social networking sites such as Facebook. To empower people with dyslexia-style writing to express them-selves more confidently on SNSs  we designed and implemented Additional Writing Help(AWH) - a writing assistance tool to proofread text produced by users with dyslexia before they post on Facebook. AWH was powered by a neural machine translation (NMT) model that translates dyslexia style to non-dyslexia style writing. We evaluated the performance and the design of AWH through a week-long field study with 19 people with dyslexia and received highly positive feedback. Our field study demonstrated the value of providing better and more extensive writing support on SNSs  and the potential of AI for building a more inclusive Internet.
204,Signal Appropriation of Explicit HIV Status Disclosure Fields in Sex-Social Apps used by Gay and Bisexual Men,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Mark Warner  University College London Juan Fernando Maestre  Indiana University Bloomington Jo Gibbs  University College London Chia-Fang Chung  Indiana University Ann Blandford  University College London,"HIV status disclosure fields in online sex-social applications (""apps"") are designed to help increase awareness  reduce stigma  and promote sexual health. Public disclosure could also help those diagnosed relate to others with similar statuses to feel less isolated. However  in our interview study (n=28) with HIV positive and negative men who have sex with men (MSM)  we found some users preferred to keep their status private  especially when disclosure could stigmatise and disadvantage them  or risk revealing their status to someone they knew offline in a different context. How do users manage these tensions between health  stigma  and privacy? We analysed our interview data using signalling theory as a conceptual framework and identify participants developing 'signal appropriation' strategies  helping them manage the disclosure of their HIV status. Additionally  we propose a set of design considerations that explore the use of signals in the design of sensitive disclosure fields."
205,Local Standards for Anonymization Practices in Health  Wellness  Accessibility  and Aging Research at CHI,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Jacob Abbott  Indiana University Bloomington Haley MacLeod  Indiana University Bloomington Novia Nurain  Indiana University Bloomington Gustave Ekobe  Indiana University Bloomington Sameer Patil  Indiana University Bloomington,When studying technologies pertaining to health  wellness  accessibility  and aging  researchers are often required to perform a balancing act between controlling and sharing sensitive data of the people in their studies and protecting the privacy of these participants. If the data can be anonymized and shared  it can boost the impact of the research by facilitating replication and extension. Despite anonymization  data reporting and sharing may lead to re-identification of participants  which can be particularly problematic when the research deals with sensitive topics  such as health. We analyzed 509 CHI papers in the domains of health  wellness  accessibility  and aging to examine data reporting and sharing practices. Our analysis revealed notable patterns and trends regarding the reporting of age  gender  participant types  sample sizes  methodology  ethical considerations  anonymization techniques  and data sharing. Based on our findings  we propose several suggestions for community standards and practices that could facilitate data reporting and sharing while limiting the privacy risks for study participants.
206,"Emotion and Experience in Negotiating HIV-Related Digital Resources: ""It's not just a runny nose!""",Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Aneesha Singh  University College London Jo Gibbs  University College London Ann Blandford  University College London,While digital technologies are increasingly being used to provide support and diagnoses remotely  it is unclear whether they offer adequate emotional support and appropriate messages in navigating complex  stigmatised and sensitive conditions that can have a momentous impact on people's lives. In this paper  we investigate how and why people access existing HIV resources  and their experiences of using these resources through a survey with 197 respondents and an interview and think-aloud study with 28 participants. Our findings indicate that many HIV-related resources do not address the anxiety-provoking reasons for access  reinforce stigma and neglect to provide important information and emotional support. We finally discuss potential ways of addressing these issues in the current environment where more sexual health services are being delivered online.
207,This Girl is on Fire Sensemaking in an Online Health Community for Vulvodynia,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Alyson L. Young  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Andrew D. Miller  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,Online health communities (OHCs) allow people living with a shared diagnosis or medical condition to connect with peers for social support and advice. OHCs have been well studied in conditions like diabetes and cancer  but less is known about their role in enigmatic diseases with unknown or complex causal mechanisms. In this paper  we study one such condition: Vulvodynia  a chronic pain syndrome of the vulvar region. Through observations of and interviews with members of a vulvodynia Facebook group  we found that while the interaction types are broadly similar to those found in other OHCs  the women spent more time seeking basic information and building individualized management plans. They also encounter significant emotional and interpersonal challenges  which they discuss with each other. We use this study to extend the field's understanding of OHCs  and to propose implications for the design of self-tracking tools to support sensemaking in enigmatic conditions.

209,SIGCHI Lifetime Research Award Talk: Making Digital Tangible,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Forth,Hiroshi Ishii  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Today's mainstream Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research primarily addresses functional concerns – the needs of users  practical applications  and usability evaluation. Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms are driven by vision and carried out with an artistic approach. While today's technologies will become obsolete in one year  and today's applications will be replaced in 10 years  true visions – we believe – can last longer than 100 years. Tangible Bits (3  4) seeks to realize seamless interfaces between humans  digital information  and the physical environment by giving physical form to digital information and computation  making bits directly manipulatable and perceptible both in the foreground and background of our consciousness (peripheral awareness). Our goal is to invent new design media for artistic expression as well as for scientific analysis  taking advantage of the richness of human senses and skills we develop throughout our lifetime interacting with the physical world  as well as the computational reflection enabled by real-time sensing and digital feedback. Radical Atoms (5) leaps beyond Tangible Bits by assuming a hypothetical generation of materials that can change form and properties dynamically  becoming as reconfigurable as pixels on a screen. Radical Atoms is the future material that can transform its shape  conform to constraints  and inform the users of their affordances. Radical Atoms is a vision for the future of Human-Material Interaction  in which all digital information has a physical manifestation  thus enabling us to interact directly with it.
210,SIGCHI Lifetime Practice Award Talk The Business of UX,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Forth,Daniel J. Rosenberg  San Jose State University,"After four decades of practice  User Experience design has reached a maturity level integral to the success of every business venture. Whether the product or service provided competes in the consumer  enterprise or medical sector  UX quality is known to directly impact effectiveness  efficiency and satisfaction  the combination of which determines consumer acceptance. However  great design alone is not sufficient to achieve meaningful impact. Products with high usability lab ratings have been rejected in the crucible of real-life usage because they don't add sufficient value for either the consumer or company that delivers them to market. The failure of these so called ""great designs"" reduces them at best to museum or portfolio pieces. True impact is only achieved when the designed artifact reaches a critical level of market adoption. The service benchmarks today are Facebook with over two billion active users and Google with 1.2 trillion searches a year. Achieving significant market adoption is difficult. It requires not only delightfully fulfilling users' needs but also a UX strategy and design optimization to fit corporate business models and marketing channels  both characterized by substantial financial risk. If there is no ROI for the product  then by association there is no ROI for design or the UX team itself. UX earns a ""seat at the table"" by simultaneously delivering value for both the business and the user. Owning the Business of UX role contains strategy and management challenges. Mastering them can bring UX to corporate parity with the more established engineering and marketing professions."
211,Monotasking or Multitasking: Designing for Crowdworkers' Preferences,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Gala,Laura Lascau  University College London Sandy J. J. Gould  University of Birmingham Anna L. Cox  University College London Elizaveta Karmannaya  University College London Duncan P. Brumby  University College London,Crowdworkers receive no formal training for managing their tasks  time or working environment. To develop tools that support such workers  an understanding of their preferences and the constraints they are under is essential. We asked 317 experienced Amazon Mechanical Turk workers about factors that influence their task and time management. We found that a large number of the crowdworkers score highly on a measure of polychronicity; this means that they prefer to frequently switch tasks and happily accommodate regular work and non-work interruptions. While a preference for polychronicity might equip people well to deal with the structural demands of crowdworking platforms  we also know that multitasking negatively affects workers' productivity. This puts crowdworkers' working preferences into conflict with the desire of requesters to maximize workers' productivity. Combining the findings of prior research with the new knowledge obtained from our participants  we enumerate practical design options that could enable workers  requesters and platform developers to make adjustments that would improve crowdworkers' experiences.
212,Cicero: Multi-Turn  Contextual Argumentation for Accurate Crowdsourcing,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Gala,Quanze Chen  University of Washington Jonathan Bragg  University of Washington Lydia B. Chilton  Columbia University Dan S. Weld  University of Washington,Traditional approaches for ensuring high quality crowdwork have failed to achieve high-accuracy on difficult problems. Aggregating redundant answers often fails on the hardest problems when the majority is confused. Argumentation has been shown to be effective in mitigating these drawbacks. However  existing argumentation systems only support limited interactions and show workers general justifications  not context-specific arguments targeted to their reasoning. This paper presents Cicero  a new workflow that improves crowd accuracy on difficult tasks by engaging workers in multi-turn  contextual discussions through real-time  synchronous argumentation. Our experiments show that compared to previous argumentation systems which only improve the average individual worker accuracy by 6.8 percentage points on the Relation Extraction domain  our workflow achieves 16.7 percentage point improvement. Furthermore  previous argumentation approaches don't apply to tasks with many possible answers; in contrast  Cicero works well in these cases  raising accuracy from 66.7% to 98.8% on the Codenames domain.
213,Rehumanized Crowdsourcing: A Labeling Framework Addressing Bias and Ethics in Machine Learning,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Gala,Natã M. Barbosa  Syracuse University & Figure Eight Inc. Monchu Chen  Figure Eight Technologies  INC.,The increased use of machine learning in recent years led to large volumes of data being manually labeled via crowdsourcing microtasks completed by humans. This brought about dehumanization effects  namely  when task requesters overlook the humans behind the task  leading to issues of ethics (e.g.  unfair payment) and amplification of human biases  which are transferred into training data and affect machine learning in the real world. We propose a framework that allocates microtasks considering human factors of workers such as demographics and compensation. We deployed our framework to a popular crowdsourcing platform and conducted experiments with 1 919 workers collecting 160 345 human judgments. By routing microtasks to workers based on demographics and appropriate pay  our framework mitigates biases in the contributor sample and increases the hourly pay given to contributors. We discuss potential extensions and how it can promote transparency in crowdsourcing.
214,The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Gala,Maitraye Das  Northwestern University Brent Hecht  Northwestern University Darren Gergle  Northwestern University,Millions of people worldwide contribute content to peer production repositories that serve human information needs and provide vital world knowledge to prominent artificial intelligence systems. Yet  extreme gender participation disparities exist in which men significantly outnumber women. A central concern has been that due to self-focus bias  these disparities can lead to corresponding gender content disparities  in which content of interest to men is better represented than content of interest to women. This paper investigates the relationship between participation and content disparities in OpenStreetMap. We replicate findings that women are dramatically under-represented as OSM contributors  and observe that men and women contribute different types of content and do so about different places. However  the character of these differences confound simple narratives about self-focus bias: we find that on a proportional basis  men produced a higher proportion of contributions in feminized spaces compared to women  while women produced a higher proportion of contributions in masculinized spaces compared to men.
215,Multilayer Haptic Feedback for Pen-Based Tablet Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Ernst Kruijff  Simon Fraser University & University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg Saugata Biswas  Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences Christina Trepkowski  Institute of Visual Computing Jens Maiero  Institue of Visual Computing George Ghinea  Brunel University London Wolfgang Stuerzlinger  Simon Fraser University,We present a novel  multilayer interaction approach that enables state transitions between spatially above-screen and 2D on-screen feedback layers. This approach supports the exploration of haptic features that are hard to simulate using rigid 2D screens. We accomplish this by adding a haptic layer above the screen that can be actuated and interacted with (pressed on) while the user interacts with on-screen content using pen input. The haptic layer provides variable firmness and contour feedback  while its membrane functionality affords additional tactile cues like texture feedback. Through two user studies  we look at how users can use the layer in haptic exploration tasks  showing that users can discriminate well between different firmness levels  and can perceive object contour characteristics. Demonstrated also through an art application  the results show the potential of multilayer feedback to extend on-screen feedback with additional widget  tool and surface properties  and for user guidance.
216,Magnetact: Magnetic-sheet-based Haptic Interfaces for Touch Devices,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Kentaro Yasu  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,We describe a method for rapid prototyping of haptic interfaces for touch devices. A sheet-like touch interface is constructed from magnetic rubber sheets and conductive materials. The magnetic sheet is thin  and the capacitive sensor of the touch device can still detect the user's finger above the sheet because of the rubber's dielectric nature. Furthermore  tactile feedback can be customized with ease by using our magnetizing toolkit to change the magnetic patterns. Using the magnetizing toolkit  we investigated the appropriate size and thickness of haptic interfaces and demonstrated several interfaces such as buttons  sliders  switches  and dials. Our method is an easy and convenient way to customize the size  shape  and haptic feedback of a wide variety of interfaces.
217,Aarnio: Passive Kinesthetic Force Output for Foreground Interactions on an Interactive Chair,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Shan-Yuan Teng  National Taiwan University Da-Yuan Huang  National Chiao Tung University Chi Wang  National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Jun Gong  Dartmouth College Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary Xing-Dong Yang  Dartmouth College Bing-Yu Chen  National Taiwan University,We propose a new type of haptic output for foreground interactions on an interactive chair  where input is carried out explicitly in the foreground of the user's consciousness. This type of force output restricts a user's motion by modulating the resistive force when rotating a seat  tilting the backrest  or rolling the chair. These interactions are useful for many applications in a ubiquitous computing environment  ranging from immersive VR games to rapid and private query of information for people who are occupied with other tasks (e.g. in a meeting). We carefully designed and implemented our proposed haptic force output on a standard office chair and determined the recognizability of five force profiles for rotating  tilting  and rolling the chair. We present the result of our studies  as well as a set of novel interaction techniques enabled by this new force output for chairs.
218,HaptiVec: Presenting Haptic Feedback Vectors in Handheld Controllers using Embedded Tactile Pin Arrays,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Daniel K.Y. Chen  Shanghai Jiao Tong University Jean-Baptiste Chossat  Shanghai Jiao Tong University Peter B. Shull  Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"HaptiVec is a new haptic feedback paradigm for handheld controllers which allows users to feel directional haptic pressure vectors on their fingers and hands while interacting with virtual environments. We embed a 3 by 5 tactile pin array (with an average pin spacing of 25 mm) into the handles of two custom VR type controllers. By presenting directional pressure vectors in eight cardinal directions (N  NE  E  SE  S  SW  W  NW) to users without prior training  they were able to distinguish the correct direction with an accuracy of at least 79%. We illustrate two applications where our device enhances virtual experiences over traditional vibrotactile feedback. In the first application  through the classic first-person shooter Doom  we demonstrate that users can receive directional pressure feedback corresponding to the direction of incident enemy projectiles. In the second application  we demonstrate how our controller can create a more immersive experience by allowing the user to feel their virtual climate by randomizing the directional vectors and presenting the user with ""haptic rain"" which adapts with the intensity of the rainfall."
219,Context-Informed Scheduling and Analysis: Improving Accuracy of Mobile Self-Reports,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Niels van Berkel  The University of Melbourne Jorge Goncalves  The University of Melbourne Peter Koval  The University of Melbourne Simo Hosio  University of Oulu Tilman Dingler  University of Melbourne Denzil Ferreira  University of Oulu Vassilis Kostakos  University of Melbourne,Mobile self-reports are a popular technique to collect participant labelled data in the wild. While literature has focused on increasing participant compliance to self-report questionnaires  relatively little work has assessed response accuracy. In this paper  we investigate how participant context can affect response accuracy and help identify strategies to improve the accuracy of mobile self-report data. In a 3-week study we collect over 2 500 questionnaires containing both verifiable and non-verifiable questions. We find that response accuracy is higher for questionnaires that arrive when the phone is not in ongoing or very recent use. Furthermore  our results show that long completion times are an indicator of a lower accuracy. Using contextual mechanisms readily available on smartphones  we are able to explain up to 13% of the variance in participant accuracy. We offer actionable recommendations to assist researchers in their future deployments of mobile self-report studies.
220,Investigating the Effect of Orientation and Visual Style on Touchscreen Slider Performance,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Ashley Colley  University of Lapland Sven Mayer  University of Stuttgart Niels Henze  University of Regensburg,Sliders are one of the most fundamental components used in touchscreen user interfaces (UIs). When entering data using a slider  errors occur due e.g. to visual perception  resulting in inputs not matching what is intended by the user. However  it is unclear if the errors occur uniformly across the full range of the slider or if there are systematic offsets. We conducted a study to assess the errors occurring when entering values with horizontal and vertical sliders as well as two common visual styles. Our results reveal significant effects of slider orientation and style on the precision of the entered values. Furthermore  we identify systematic offsets that depend on the visual style and the target value. As the errors are partially systematic  they can be compensated to improve users' precision. Our findings provide UI designers with data to optimize user experiences in the wide variety of application areas where slider based touchscreen input is used.
221,LocknType: Lockout Task Intervention for Discouraging Smartphone App Use,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Jaejeung Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Joonyoung Park  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Hyunsoo Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Minsam Ko  Hanyang University Uichin Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Instant access and gratification make it difficult for us to self-limit the use of smartphone apps. We hypothesize that a slight increase in the interaction cost of accessing an app could successfully discourage app use. We propose a proactive intervention that requests users to perform a simple lockout task (e.g.  typing a fixed length number) whenever a target app is launched. We investigate how a lockout task with varying workloads (i.e.  pause only without number input  10-digit input  and 30-digit input) influence a user's decision making  by a 3-week  in-situ experiment with 40 participants. Our findings show that even the pause-only task that requires a user to press a button to proceed discouraged an average of 13.1% of app use  and the 30-digit-input task discouraged 47.5%. We derived determinants of app use and non-use decision making for a given lockout task. We further provide implications for persuasive technology design for discouraging undesired behaviors.
222,Diagnosing and Coping with Mode Errors in Korean-English Dual-language Keyboard,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Sangyoon Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Jaeyeon Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Geehyuk Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,In countries where languages with non-Latin characters are prevalent  people use a keyboard with two language modes namely  the native language and English  and often experience mode errors. To diagnose the mode error problem  we conducted a field study and observed that 78% of the mode errors occurred immediately after application switching. We implemented four methods (Auto-switch  Preview  Smart-toggle  and Preview & Smart-toggle) based on three strategies to deal with the mode error problem and conducted field studies to verify their effectiveness. In the studies considering Korean-English dual input  Auto-switch was ineffective. On the contrary  Preview significantly reduced the mode errors from 75.1% to 41.3%  and Smart-toggle saved typing cost for recovering from mode errors. In Preview & Smart-toggle  Preview reduced mode errors and Smart-toggle handled 86.2% of the mode errors that slipped past Preview. These results suggest that Preview & Smart-toggle is a promising method for preventing mode errors for the Korean-English dual-input environment.

Walter Lee  University of Minnesota,Augmenting grassroots community policing (CP) efforts with technologies that assist citizens is a promising strategy for reducing real and perceived fear of crime. We used a human-centered design approach  working with residents of the St. Paul Summit-University neighborhood  to discern abstract functionalities for developing new CP technology. We then created and evaluated NeighBoard (Figure 1)  which aims to enhance the social fabric of communities by letting citizens implement their own strategies for preventing crime and maintaining safety in their neighborhood.

Joseph  National Institute of Design Lamha Bijili  National Institute of Design Md. Aasif Anwar  National Institute of Design Urvi  National Institute of Design,The current Indian education system promotes competition among students  emphasizing highly on ranks and marks scored. As a consequence  students tend to drift away from a collaborative mindset to a competitive one. The learning gap is even larger in schools catering to lower income groups due to the absence of digital infrastructure and digital knowledge. As a result  a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge  the internet  causing the gap to increase between students in the society. With co ed  we attempt to bridge these gaps by providing a platform to foster mutual learning as well as combining digital mediums and the long-established pen and paper in a seamless manner.
226,SDC03: Drawxi: An Accessible Drawing Tool for Collaboration,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Suraj Chiplunkar  Indiana University Anany Maini  Indiana University Dinesh Ram  Indiana University Zixuan Zheng  Indiana University Yaxin Zheng  Indiana University Bloomington,Visual impairment can profoundly impact well-being and social advancement. Current solutions for accessing graphical information fail to provide an affordable  user-friendly collaborative platform for visually impaired and sighted people to work together. Therefore  sighted users tend to have low expectations from visually impaired people while working in a team. Hence  visually impaired people feel discouraged to participate in a mixed population collaborative environment. Consequently  their generative capabilities remain devalued. In this paper  we propose an audio-haptic enabled tool (Drawxi) for free-form sketching and sharing simple diagrams (processes  workflows  ideas  perspectives  etc.). It provides a common platform for visually-impaired and sighted people to work together by communicating each other's ideas visually. Thus  enabling the discovery of generative capabilities in a hands-on way. We relied upon participatory research methods (Contextual inquiry  Co-Design) involving visually impaired participants throughout the design process. We evaluated our proposed design through usability testing which revealed that collaboration between visually impaired and sighted people benefits from the use of common tools and platforms. Thereby  enhancing the degree of their participation in a collaborative environment and quality of co-creation activities.

While people are constantly suffering from body shape anxiety  they do not realize that beauty standard is not an absolute truth and that it is changing and depends on time and space. To help people free from the constraint imposed by social beauty standards and connect those who have concerns over their body shape  we devised a technological solution named ""Shadoji""  which can bring people a new perspective on their body shapes  give them a chance to create their unique body shape emoji  and to explore diverse body shapes from users around the world."

We collected data through 18 semi-structured interviews with primary family and respite caregivers and qualitatively analyzed the interviews to extract common needs. Participants identified three main needs that our designs address: building trust through status updates  learning routines & care management  and accessing technology. Based on those needs  we designed a prototype of an application which connects primary family caregivers with respite caregivers and facilitates communication between the involved parties. This design can serve as a framework for future work designed to improve elder care in general  the well-being of caregivers  and the effectiveness of respite care.

Sharing feelings  emotions  thoughts  activities  and even finances enables couples to spend quality time with each other. In particular  financial management plays an important role in relationship quality of emerging adult couples. We present Amor  a mobile application that bridges emerging adult couples closely to pool and spend their money together for a common goal. Amor also allows the couples to explore activities that harmonize with their characteristics as well as an encouragement for the two to achieve their desired goals.

Reconnect with Yourself to Better Connect with Others,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Audrey Drolet  Université Laval Thomas Lemonde-Marzell  Université Laval Pablo Matos Da Silva  Université Laval Kim Lamontagne  Université Laval Marjorie Bédard  Université Laval,Occidental societies are becoming increasingly demanding. Citizens often feel overwhelmed and feel the need to rest  which they do so by isolating themselves from others. Individuals who use this time alone to reflect on their situation find that this reflection helps create deeper connections with others afterwards. With this in mind  we developed Senti?  a solution that aims to encourage people to take time for themselves in hopes that it will lead them to be more open-minded when interacting with others. The solution helps people focus on bodily sensations and generates a comfortable and effortless time for introspection. Senti? uses the subconscious benefits of perceiving one's heartbeat to foster personal reflection.

Care staff and family members want to be able to connect with residents/loved ones but have limitations (time constraints  unsure how)  and it can be challenging to feel a connection to another resident who has differing abilities. We propose that through sharing strong positive memories  members of a nursing home community (residents  care staff  and families) will be able to build empathy for one another and thus strengthen their community bonds. By applying multi-modal technologies to a familiar medium  the book  we provided a means by which intergenerational users  from various backgrounds  could interact with and gain meaning from the content.

Loss of local activities and mobility may leave children prepared for transitions to adulthood and make them less independent and may have negative health effects. In this paper  we discuss the findings of our research on children's unsupervised play in their neighborhoods. We propose HelloBox  a system including an app  wearable RFID tags  and check-in stations to keep track of children when they are outside without an adult. HelloBox lets parents know where their children are without restricting their independence and builds community between local families. The project focuses on improving children's independent mobility and encouraging social interactions between families within neighborhoods.
233,SDC10: HearU: An Integrated System to Raise Awareness of Hearing Loss,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Beijia Wang  University of Washington Mengxiao Song  University of Washington Yuting Han  University of Washington Duo Wang  University of Washington,Hearing loss is a prevalent public health crisis that often goes unnoticed in public eye due to its invisibility. People who are hard of hearing (HH) often experience social isolation caused by the lack of understanding from the hearing community. Our research revealed that there is a communication gap between the hearing and HH communities. The current state of art tends to focus on assisting HH people to participate in conversations  which places more responsibility on the HH community. There is a lack of responsibility of people in the hearing community. However  communication works in two directions; it requires both parties to take responsibility. In this paper  we present HearU - an integrated  multichannel system that includes public interaction. Through the creation of an immersive experience that increases people's awareness of hearing loss  we aim to use HearU as a medium to weave these two communities together as a whole.

Our research found that people with ALS express a lack of connection with other people with the disease  and that the general public lacks awareness about ALS. We also identified an engagement problem with the currently available resources to connect and support people with ALS. To address these issues  we introduce 'PALS' - an accessible crowdsourcing and connection quilt  first hung like a tapestry in the ALS clinic  then later used as an interactive public display. The quilt offers the opportunity to access crowdsourced information concerning individual experiences of ALS. Our work offers three primary contributions: 1) adding to limited HCI research concerning the ALS community by establishing the needs  2) applying the 'PALS' quilt design solution to these needs  and 3) combining three modalities: crowdsourcing  tangible tapestry displays  and interactive waiting education in a unique way.
235,SDC12: TechBuddies: Engaging Students to Teach Retirees about Technology,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Jim Philippe Neussl  University College London Rebecca Zheng  University College London George Hanson  University College London Boyin Yang  University College London,Retirees suffer from impaired mobility  loss of friends and family  and loneliness. Although these problems could be mitigated through the use of digital communication devices and the internet  many retirees lack the skill and confidence to use them effectively. The existing community initiatives that aim to help retirees understand technology often lack volunteers to teach them. This is why we developed TechBuddies  a two-component system aimed at engaging more students as volunteers. The first component consists of an interactive display that raises awareness about volunteering opportunities by simulating an interaction between a retiree and the potential volunteer. The second component involves an app-based platform that facilitates communication about events and encourages long-term engagement. TechBuddies raises awareness about and provides a platform for inter-generational interactions between students and retirees who are a part of the same local community.
236,Neighborhood Perception in Bar Charts,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Lomond,Mingqian Zhao  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Huamin Qu  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Michael Sedlmair  University of Stuttgart,In this paper  we report three user experiments that investigate in how far the perception of a bar in a bar chart changes based on the height of its neighboring bars. We hypothesized that the perception of the very same bar  for instance  might differ when it is surrounded by the top highest vs. the top lowest bars. Our results show that such neighborhood effects exist: a target bar surrounded by high neighbor bars  is perceived to be lower as the same bar surrounded with low neighbors. Yet  the effect size of this neighborhood effect is small compared to other data-inherent effects: the judgment accuracy largely depends on the target bar rank  number of data items  and other data characteristics of the dataset. Based on the findings  we discuss design implications for perceptually optimizing bar charts.
237,Ranked-List Visualization: A Graphical Perception Study,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Lomond,Pranathi Mylavarapu  University of Maryland  College Park Adil Yalcin  Keshif  LLC. Xan Gregg  SAS Institute  Inc. Niklas Elmqvist  University of Maryland  College Park,Visualization of ranked lists is a common occurrence  but many in-the-wild solutions fly in the face of vision science and visualization wisdom. For example  treemaps and bubble charts are commonly used for this purpose  despite the fact that the data is not hierarchical and that length is easier to perceive than area. Furthermore  several new visual representations have recently been suggested in this area  including wrapped bars  packed bars  piled bars  and Zvinca plots. To quantify the differences and trade-offs for these ranked-list visualizations  we here report on a crowdsourced graphical perception study involving six such visual representations  including the ubiquitous scrolled barchart  in three tasks: ranking (assessing a single item)  comparison (two items)  and average (assessing global distribution). Results show that wrapped bars may be the best choice for visualizing ranked lists  and that treemaps are surprisingly accurate despite the use of area rather than length to represent value.
238,Saliency Deficit and Motion Outlier Detection in Animated Scatterplots,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Lomond,Rafael Veras  University of Ontario Institute of Technology Christopher Collins  University of Ontario Institute of Technology,We report the results of a crowdsourced experiment that measured the accuracy of motion outlier detection in multivariate  animated scatterplots. The targets were outliers either in speed or direction of motion  and were presented with varying levels of saliency in dimensions that are irrelevant to the task of motion outlier detection (e.g.  color  size  position). We found that participants had trouble finding the outlier when it lacked irrelevant salient features and that visual channels contribute unevenly to the odds of an outlier being correctly detected. Direction of motion contributes the most to accurate detection of speed outliers  and position contributes the most to accurate detection of direction outliers. We introduce the concept of saliency deficit in which item importance in the data space is not reflected in the visualization due to a lack of saliency. We conclude that motion outlier detection is not well supported in multivariate animated scatterplots.
239,Measuring the Separability of Shape  Size  and Color in Scatterplots,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Lomond,Stephen Smart  University of Colorado Boulder Danielle Albers Szafir  University of Colorado Boulder,Scatterplots commonly use multiple visual channels to encode multivariate datasets. Such visualizations often use size  shape  and color as these dimensions are considered separable--dimensions represented by one channel do not significantly interfere with viewers' abilities to perceive data in another. However  recent work shows the size of marks significantly impacts color difference perceptions  leading to broader questions about the separability of these channels. In this paper  we present a series of crowdsourced experiments measuring how mark shape  size  and color influence data interpretation in multiclass scatterplots. Our results indicate that mark shape significantly influences color and size perception  and that separability among these channels functions asymmetrically: shape more strongly influences size and color perceptions in scatterplots than size and color influence shape. Models constructed from the resulting data can help designers anticipate viewer perceptions to build more effective visualizations.

Such a system can enable easy and large-scale deployment for multi-user tracking and sensing without the need for additional sensors through the use of existing WiFi devices (e.g.  desktops  laptops and smart appliances). The basic idea is to identify and extract the signal reflection corresponding to each individual user with the help of multiple WiFi links and all the available WiFi channels at 5GHz. Given the extracted signal reflection of each user  MultiTrack examines the path of the reflected signals at multiple links to simultaneously track multiple users. It further reconstructs the signal profile of each user as if only a single user has performed activity in the environment to facilitate multi-user activity recognition. We evaluate MultiTrack in different multipath environments with up to 4 users for multi-user tracking and up to 3 users for activity recognition. Experimental results show that our system can achieve decimeter localization accuracy and over 92% activity recognition accuracy under multi-user scenarios.
243,SurfaceSight: A New Spin on Touch  User  and Object Sensing for IoT Experiences,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 1,Gierad Laput  Carnegie Mellon University Chris Harrison  Carnegie Mellon University,"IoT appliances are gaining consumer traction  from smart thermostats to smart speakers. These devices generally have limited user interfaces  most often small buttons and touchscreens  or rely on voice control. Further  these devices know little about their surroundings – unaware of objects  people and activities happening around them. Consequently  interactions with these ""smart"" devices can be cumbersome and limited. We describe SurfaceSight  an approach that enriches IoT experiences with rich touch and object sensing  offering a complementary input channel and increased contextual awareness. For sensing  we incorporate LIDAR into the base of IoT devices  providing an expansive  ad hoc plane of sensing just above the surface on which devices rest. We can recognize and track a wide array of objects  including finger input and hand gestures. We can also track people and estimate which way they are facing. We evaluate the accuracy of these new capabilities and illustrate how they can be used to power novel and contextually-aware interactive experiences."

For example  social researchers are interested in studying domestic abuse  and healthcare professionals are interested in caregiver-patient interaction. Today  such studies rely on diaries and questionnaires  which are subjective  erroneous  and hard to sustain in longitudinal studies. We introduce Marko  a system that automatically collects behavior-related data  without asking people to write diaries or wear sensors. Marko transmits a low power wireless signal and analyses its reflections from the environment. It maps those reflections to how users interact with the environment (e.g.  access to medication cabinet) and with each other (e.g.  watch TV together). It provides novel algorithms for identifying who-does-what  and bootstrapping the system in new homes without asking users for new annotations. We evaluate Marko with a one-month deployment in six homes  and demonstrate its value for studying couple relationships and caregiver-patient interaction.
245,MilliSonic: Pushing the Limits of Acoustic Motion Tracking,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 1,Anran Wang  University of Washington Shyamnath Gollakota  University of Washington,Recent years have seen interest in device tracking and localization using acoustic signals. State-of-the-art acoustic motion tracking systems however do not achieve millimeter accuracy and require large separation between microphones and speakers  and as a result  do not meet the requirements for many VR/AR applications. Further  tracking multiple concurrent acoustic transmissions from VR devices today requires sacrificing accuracy or frame rate. We present MilliSonic  a novel system that pushes the limits of acoustic based motion tracking. Our core contribution is a novel localization algorithm that can provably achieve sub-millimeter 1D tracking accuracy in the presence of multipath  while using only a single beacon with a small 4-microphone array.Further  MilliSonic enables concurrent tracking of up to four smartphones without reducing frame rate or accuracy. Our evaluation shows that MilliSonic achieves 0.7mm median 1D accuracy and a 2.6mm median 3D accuracy for smartphones  which is 5x more accurate than state-of-the-art systems. MilliSonic enables two previously infeasible interaction applications: a) 3D tracking of VR headsets using the smartphone as a beacon and b) fine-grained 3D tracking for the Google Cardboard VR system using a small microphone array.

Gordon  Stanford University Shumin Zhai  Google,We study the effects of haptic augmentation on tapping  path following  and drag & drop tasks based on a recent flagship smartphone with refined touch sensing and haptic actuator technologies. Results show actuated haptic confirmation on tapping targets was subjectively appreciated by some users but did not improve tapping speed or accuracy. For drag & drop  a clear performance improvement was measured when haptic feedback is applied to target boundary crossing  particularly when the targets are small. For path following tasks  virtual haptic feedback improved accuracy at a reduced speed in a sitting condition. Stronger results were achieved in a physical haptic mock-up. Overall  we found actuated touchscreen haptic feedback particularly effective when the touched object was visually interfered by the finger. Participants subjective experience of haptic feedback in all tasks tended to be more positive than their time or accuracy performance suggests. We compare and discuss these findings with previous results on early generations of devices. The work provides an empirical foundation to product design and future research of touch input and haptic systems.
247,Effect of Orientation on Unistroke Touch Gestures,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Sven Mayer  University of Stuttgart Valentin Schwind  University of Stuttgart Huy Viet Le  University of Stuttgart Dominik Weber  University of Stuttgart Jonas Vogelsang  University of Stuttgart Johannes Wolf  University of Stuttgart Niels Henze  University of Regensburg,As touchscreens are the most successful input method of current mobile devices  touch gestures became a widely used input technique. While gestures provide users with advantages to express themselves  they also introduce challenges regarding accuracy and memorability. In this paper  we investigate the effect of a gesture's orientation on how well the gesture can be performed. We conducted a study in which participants performed systematically rotated unistroke gestures. For straight lines as well as for compound lines  we found that users tend to align gestures with the primary axes. We show that the error can be described by a Clausen function with R² = .93. Based on our findings  we suggest design implications and highlight the potential for recognizing flick gestures  visualizing gestures and improving recognition of compound gestures.
248,An Evaluation of Touch Input at the Edge of a Table,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Nikhita Joshi  University of Waterloo Daniel Vogel  University of Waterloo,Tables  desks  and counters are often nearby  motivating their use as interactive surfaces. However  they are typically cluttered. As an alternative  we explore touch input along the 'edge' of table-like surfaces. The performance of tapping  crossing  and dragging is tested along the two ridges and front face of a table edge. Results show top ridge movement time is comparable to the top face when tapping or dragging. When crossing  both ridges are at least 11% faster than the top face. Effective width analysis is used to model performance and provide recommended target sizes. Based on observed user behaviour  variations of top and bottom ridge crossing are explored in a second study  and design recommendations with example applications are provided.
249,Modeling Fully and Partially Constrained Lasso Movements in a Grid of Icons,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Shota Yamanaka  Yahoo Japan Corporation Wolfgang Stuerzlinger  Simon Fraser University,Lassoing objects is a basic function in illustration software and presentation tools. Yet  for many common object arrangements lassoing is sometimes time-consuming to perform and requires precise pen operation. In this work  we studied lassoing movements in a grid of objects similar to icons. We propose a quantitative model to predict the time to lasso such objects depending on the margins between icons  their sizes  and layout  which all affect the number of stopping and crossing movements. Results of two experiments showed that our models predict fully and partially constrained movements with high accuracy. We also analyzed the speed profiles and pen stroke trajectories and identified deeper insights into user behaviors  such as that an unconstrained area can induce higher movement speeds even in preceding path segments.

253,PersonalTouch: Improving Touchscreen Usability by Personalizing Accessibility Settings based on Individual User's Touchscreen Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 1,Yi-Hao Peng  National Taiwan University Muh-Tarng Lin  National Taiwan University Yi Chen  National Taiwan University TzuChuan Chen  National Taiwan University Pin Sung Ku  National Taiwan University Paul Taele  Texas A&M University Chin Guan Lim  National Taiwan University Mike Y. Chen  National Taiwan University,Modern touchscreen devices have recently introduced customizable touchscreen settings to improve accessibility for users with motor impairments. For example  iOS 10 introduced the following four Touch Accommodation settings: 1) Hold Duration  2) Ignore Repeat  3) Tap Assistance  and 4) Tap Assistance Gesture Delay. These four independent settings lead to a total of more than 1 million possible configurations  making it impractical to manually determine the optimal settings. We present PersonalTouch  which collects and analyzes touchscreen gestures performed by individual users  and recommends personalized  optimal touchscreen accessibility settings. Results from our user study show that PersonalTouch significantly improves touch input success rate for users with motor impairments (20.2%  N=12  p=.00054) and for users without motor impairments (1.28%  N=12  p=.032).
254,Cluster Touch: Improving Touch Accuracy on Smartphones for People with Motor and Situational Impairments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 1,Martez E. Mott  University of Washington Jacob O. Wobbrock  University of Washington,We present Cluster Touch  a combined user-independent and user-specific touch offset model that improves the accuracy of touch input on smartphones for people with motor impairments  and for people experiencing situational impairments while walking. Cluster Touch combines touch examples from multiple users to create a shared user-independent touch model  which is then updated with touch examples provided by an individual user to make it user-specific. Owing to this combination  Cluster Touch allows people to quickly improve the accuracy of their smartphones by providing only 20 touch examples. In a user study with 12 people with motor impairments and 12 people without motor impairments  but who were walking  Cluster Touch improved touch accuracy by 14.65% for the former group and 6.81% for the latter group over the native touch sensor. Furthermore  in an offline analysis of existing mobile interfaces  Cluster Touch improved touch accuracy by 8.21% and 4.84% over the native touch sensor for the two user groups  respectively.
255,Accessible Gesture Typing for Non-Visual Text Entry on Smartphones,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 1,Syed Masum Billah  Stony Brook University Yu-Jung Ko  Stony Brook University Vikas Ashok  Stony Brook University Xiaojun Bi  Stony Brook University IV Ramakrishnan  Stony Brook University,Gesture typing--entering a word by gliding the finger sequentially over letter to letter-- has been widely supported on smartphones for sighted users. However  this input paradigm is currently inaccessible to blind users: it is difficult to draw shape gestures on a virtual keyboard without access to key visuals. This paper describes the design of accessible gesture typing  to bring this input paradigm to blind users. To help blind users figure out key locations  the design incorporates the familiar screen-reader supported touch exploration that narrates the keys as the user drags the finger across the keyboard. The design allows users to seamlessly switch between exploration and gesture typing mode by simply lifting the finger. Continuous touch-exploration like audio feedback is provided during word shape construction that helps the user glide in the right direction of the key locations constituting the word. Exploration mode resumes once word shape is completed. Distinct earcons help distinguish gesture typing mode from touch exploration mode  and thereby avoid unintended mix-ups. A user study with 14 blind people shows 35% increment in their typing speed  indicative of the promise and potential of gesture typing technology for non-visual text entry.
256,Stroke-Gesture Input for People with Motor Impairments: Empirical Results & Research Roadmap,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 1,Radu-Daniel Vatavu  University Ştefan cel Mare of Suceava Ovidiu-Ciprian Ungurean  University Ştefan cel Mare of Suceava,We examine the articulation characteristics of stroke-gestures produced by people with upper body motor impairments on touchscreens as well as the accuracy rates of popular classification techniques  such as the $-family  to recognize those gestures. Our results on a dataset of 9 681 gestures collected from 70 participants reveal that stroke-gestures produced by people with motor impairments are recognized less accurately than the same gesture types produced by people without impairments  yet still accurately enough (93.0%) for practical purposes; are similar in terms of geometrical criteria to the gestures produced by people without impairments; but take considerably more time to produce (3.4s vs. 1.7s) and exhibit lower consistency (-49.7%). We outline a research roadmap for accessible gesture input on touchscreens for users with upper body motor impairments  and we make our large gesture dataset publicly available in the community.
257,Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Filip Škola  Faculty of Informatics  Masaryk University Fotis Liarokapis  Faculty of Informatics  Masaryk University,Virtual reality (VR) can be immersive to such a degree that users sometimes report feeling tactile sensations based on visualization of the touch  without any actual physical contact. This effect is not only interesting for studies of human perception  but can also be leveraged to improve the quality of VR by evoking tactile sensations without usage of specialized equipment. The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch  transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG)  that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain  as well as to identify its neural correlates. Results confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation  and some of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.
258,To Repeat or Not to Repeat? Redesigning Repeating Auditory Alarms Based on EEG Analysis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Yi-Chen Lee  National Chiao Tung University Fu-Yin Cherng  National Chiao Tung University Jung-Tai King  National Chaio Tung Univerity Wen-Chieh Lin  National Chiao Tung University,Auditory alarms that repeatedly interrupt users until they react are common  especially in the context of alarms. However  when an alarm repeats  our brains habituate to it and perceive it less and less  with reductions in both perception and attention-shifting: a phenomenon known as the repetition-suppression effect (RS). To retain users' perception and attention  this paper proposes and tests the use of pitch- and intensity-modulated alarms. Its experimental findings suggest that the proposed modulated alarms can reduce RS  albeit in different patterns  depending on whether pitch or intensity is the focus of the modulation. Specifically  pitch-modulated alarms were found to reduce RS more when the number of repetitions was small  while intensity-modulated alarms reduced it more as the number of repetitions increased. Based on these results  we make several recommendations for the design of improved repeating alarms  based on which modulation approach should be adopted in various situations.
259,Detecting Visuo-Haptic Mismatches in Virtual Reality using the Prediction Error Negativity of Event-Related Brain Potentials,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Lukas Gehrke  Technical University of Berlin Sezen Akman  Technical University of Berlin Pedro Lopes  University of Chicago & Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Albert Chen  University of Chicago Avinash Kumar Singh  National Chiao Tung University Hsiang-Ting Chen  University of Technology Sydney Chin-Teng Lin  University of Technology Sydney Klaus Gramann  University of California  San Diego & Technische Universität Berlin,Designing immersion is the key challenge in virtual reality; this challenge has driven advancements in displays  rendering and recently  haptics. To increase our sense of physical immersion  for instance  vibrotactile gloves render the sense of touching  while electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) renders forces. Unfortunately  the established metric to assess the effectiveness of haptic devices relies on the user's subjective interpretation of unspecific  yet standardized  questions. Here  we explore a new approach to detect a conflict in visuo-haptic integration (e.g.  inadequate haptic feedback based on poorly configured collision detection) using electroencephalography (EEG). We propose analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) during interaction with virtual objects. In our study  participants touched virtual objects in three conditions and received either no haptic feedback  vibration  or vibration and EMS feedback. To provoke a brain response in unrealistic VR interaction  we also presented the feedback prematurely in 25% of the trials. We found that the early negativity component of the ERP (so called prediction error) was more pronounced in the mismatch trials  indicating we successfully detected haptic conflicts using our technique. Our results are a first step towards using ERPs to automatically detect visuo-haptic mismatches in VR  such as those that can cause a loss of the user's immersion.
260,Measuring the Influences of Musical Parameters on Cognitive and Behavioral Responses to Audio Notifications Using EEG and Large-scale Online Studies,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Fu-Yin Cherng  National Chiao Tung University Yi-Chen Lee  National Chiao Tung University Jung-Tai King  National Chaio Tung Univerity Wen-Chieh Lin  National Chiao Tung University,Prior studies have evaluated various designs for audio notifications. However  calls for more in-depth research on how such notifications work  especially at the level of users' cognitive states  have gone unanswered; and studies evaluating audio notifications with large numbers of participants in multiple environments have been rare. This study conducted an electroencephalography study (N=20) and an online study (N=967) to enhance understandings of how three musical parameters – melody (simple  complex)  pitch (high  low)  and tempo (fast  slow) – influenced users' cognition and behaviors. There are eight different notifications with different combinations of these parameters. The online study analyzed the effects of user-specific and environmental information on users' behaviors while they listened to these notifications. The results revealed that tempo and pitch have the main effect on the speed and strength (accuracy) of users' cognition and behaviors. The users' characteristics and environments influenced the effects of these musical parameters.
261,Personal Health Oracle: Explorations of Personalized Predictions in Diabetes Self-Management,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Pooja M. Desai  Columbia University Teachers College Elliot G. Mitchell  Columbia University Medical Center Maria L. Hwang  Fashion Institute of Technology Matthew E. Levine  California Institute of Technology David J. Albers  University of Colorado Medicine; Columbia University Medical Center Lena Mamykina  Columbia University Medical Center,The increasing availability of health data and knowledge about computationally modeling human physiology opens new opportunities for personalized predictions in health. Yet little is known about how individuals interact and reason with personalized predictions. To explore these questions  we developed a smartphone app  GlucOracle  that uses self-tracking data of individuals with type 2 diabetes to generate personalized forecasts for post-meal blood glucose levels. We pilot-tested GlucOracle with two populations: members of an online diabetes community  knowledgeable about diabetes and technologically savvy; and individuals from a low socio-economic status community  characterized by high prevalence of diabetes  low literacy and limited experience with mobile apps. Individuals in both communities engaged with personal glucose forecasts and found them useful for adjusting immediate meal options  and planning future meals. However  the study raised new questions as to appropriate time  form  and focus of forecasts and suggested new research directions for personalized predictions in health.
262,Communicating Uncertainty in Fertility Prognosis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Hanna Schneider  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Julia Wayrauther  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Mariam Hassib  Bundeswehr University Munich Andreas Butz  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich,Communicating uncertainty has been shown to provide positive effects on user understanding and decision-making. Surprisingly however  most personal health tracking applications fail to disclose the accuracy of their measurements and predictions. In the case of fertility tracking applications (FTAs)  inaccurate predictions have already led to numerous unwanted pregnancies and law suits. However  integrating uncertainty into FTAs is challenging: Prediction accuracy is hard to understand and communicate  and its effect on users' trust and behavior is not well understood. We created a prototype for uncertainty visualizations for FTAs and evaluated it in a four-week field study with real users and their own data (N=9). Our results uncover far-reaching effects of communicating uncertainty: For example  users interpreted prediction accuracy as a proxy for their cycle health and as a security indicator for contraception. Displaying predicted and detected fertile phases next to each other helped users to understand uncertainty without negative emotional effects.
263,A Wee Bit More Interaction: Designing and Evaluating an Overactive Bladder App,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Ana-Maria Salai  Heriot-Watt University Lynne Baillie  Heriot-Watt University,Overactive Bladder (OAB) is a widespread condition  affecting 20% of the population. Even though it is a treatable condition  people often do not seek treatment. In this paper  we describe how we co-designed and evaluated with 30 stakeholders (9 medical professionals and 21 end-users) an OAB mobile health application that aims to increase adherence to self-managed treatment. Our results support previous research that visualizing progress  setting goals  receiving reminders and feedback increases use. We discovered that games could be used successfully as a distraction technique for urge suppression. Contrary to the current research direction  automatically calculated features could be a detriment to app interaction. Regarding evaluation  we found that designers may not want to rely only on questionnaires when assessing the success of a game and its emotional impact on users.
264,My blood sugar is higher on the weekends: Finding a Role for Context and Context-Awareness in the Design of Health Self-Management Technology,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Shriti Raj  University of Michigan Kelsey Toporski  University of Michigan Ashley Garrity  University of Michigan Joyce M. Lee  University of Michigan Mark W. Newman  University of Michigan,Tools for self-care of chronic conditions often do not fit the contexts in which self-care happens because the influence of context on self-care practices is unclear. We conducted a diary study with 15 adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes and their caregivers to understand how context affects self-care. We observed different contextual settings  which we call contextual frames  in which diabetes self-management varied depending on certain factors - physical activity  food  emotional state  insulin  people  and attitudes. The relative prevalence of these factors across contextual frames impacts self-care necessitating different types of support. We show that contextual frames  as phenomenological abstractions of context  can help designers of context-aware systems systematically explore and model the relation of context with behavior and with technology supporting behavior. Lastly  considering contextual frames as sensitizing concepts  we provide design direction for using context in technology design.
265,Springlets: Expressive  Flexible and Silent On-Skin Tactile Interfaces,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Nur Al-huda Hamdan  RWTH Aachen University Adrian Wagner  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jürgen Steimle  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,We introduce Springlets  expressive  non-vibrating mechanotactile interfaces on the skin. Embedded with shape memory alloy springs  we implement Springlets as thin and flexible stickers to be worn on various body locations  thanks to their silent operation even on the neck and head. We present a technically simple and rapid technique for fabricating a wide range of Springlet interfaces and computer-generated tactile patterns. We developed Springlets for six tactile primitives: pinching  directional stretching  pressing  pulling  dragging  and expanding. A study placing Springlets on the arm and near the head demonstrates Springlets' effectiveness and wearability in both stationary and mobile situations. We explore new interactive experiences in tactile social communication  physical guidance  health interfaces  navigation  and virtual reality gaming  enabled by Springlets' unique and scalable form factor.
266,Magnetips: Combining Fingertip Tracking and Haptic Feedback for Around-Device Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Jess McIntosh  University of Copenhagen Paul Strohmeier  University of Copenhagen Jarrod Knibbe  Monash University Sebastian Boring  University of Copenhagen Kasper Hornbæk  University of Copenhagen,Around-device interaction methods expand the available interaction space for mobile devices; however  there is currently no way to simultaneously track a user's input and provide haptic feedback at the tracked point away from the device. We present Magnetips  a simple  mobile solution for around-device tracking and mid-air haptic feedback. Magnetips combines magnetic tracking and electromagnetic feedback that works regardless of visual occlusion  through most common materials  and at a size that allows for integration with mobile devices. We demonstrate: (1) high-frequency around-device tracking and haptic feedback; (2) the accuracy and range of our tracking solution which corrects for the effects of geomagnetism  necessary for enabling mobile use; and (3) guidelines for maximising strength of haptic feedback  given a desired tracking frequency. We present technical and usability evaluations of our prototype  and demonstrate four example applications of its use.
267,Pulp Friction: Exploring the Finger Pad Periphery for Subtle Haptic Feedback,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Alix Goguey  Swansea University Deepak Ranjan Sahoo  Swansea University Simon Robinson  Swansea University Jennifer Pearson  Swansea University Matt Jones  Swansea University,Current haptic feedback techniques on handheld devices are applied to the finger pad or the palm of the user. These state-of-the-art approaches are coarse-grained and tend to be intrusive  rather than subtle. In contrast  we present a new feedback technique that applies stimuli around the periphery of the finger pulp  demonstrating how this can provide rich  nuanced haptic information. We use a reconfigurable haptic device employing a ferromagnetic marble for back-of-the device handheld use  which  for the first time  probes  without instrumenting the user  the periphery of the distal phalanx with localised stimulation. We present the design-space afforded by this new technique and evaluate the human-factors of finger-peripheral touch interaction in a controlled user-study. We report results with marbles of different diameters  speeds and a combination of poking  lateral vibration and patterns; present the resulting design guidelines for finger-periphery haptic feedback; and  illustrate its potential with use case scenarios.
268,Leveraging Distal Vibrotactile Feedback for Target Acquisition,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Jay Henderson  University of Waterloo Jeff Avery  University of Waterloo Laurent Grisoni  University of Lille Edward Lank  INRIA & University of Waterloo,Many touch based interactions provide limited opportunities for direct tactile feedback; examples include multi-user touch displays  augmented reality based projections on passive surfaces  and mid-air input. In this paper  we consider distal feedback  through vibrotactile stimulation on a smart-watch placed on the user's non-dominant wrist  as an alternative feedback mechanism to interaction location vibrotactile feedback  under the user's finger. We compare the effectiveness of interaction location feedback vs. distal feedback through a Fitts's Law task completed on a smartphone. Results show that distal and interaction location feedback both reduce errors in target acquisition and exhibit statistically comparable performance  suggesting that distal vibrotactile feedback is a suitable alternative when interaction location feedback is not readily available.
269,Sketching in HCI: Hands-on Course of Sketching Techniques,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,Makayla Lewis  Brunel University London Miriam Sturdee  University of Calgary Nicolai Marquardt  University College London,Freehand sketching is a valuable process  input  output  and tool  often used by people to communicate and express ideas  as well as document  explore and describe concepts between researcher  user  or client. Sketches are fast  easy to create  and – by varying their fidelity – can be used in all areas of HCI. Sketching in HCI will explore and demonstrate themes around sketching in HCI with the aim of producing tangible outputs. Attendees will leave the course with the confidence to engage actively with sketching on an everyday basis in their research practice.
270,How to Write CHI Papers (Third Edition),Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Lennart E. Nacke  University of Waterloo,We base everything that we do as researchers on what we write. Primarily for graduate students and young researchers  it is hard to turn a research project into a successful CHI publication. This struggle continues for postdocs and young professors trying to author excellent reviews for the CHI community that pinpoint flaws and improvements in research papers. This third edition of the successful CHI paper writing course offers hands-on advice and more in-depth tutorials on how to write papers with clarity  substance  and style. It is structured into three 80-minute units with a focus on writing CHI papers.

272,SottoVoce: An Ultrasound Imaging-Based Silent Speech Interaction Using Deep Neural Networks,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Naoki Kimura  The University of Tokyo Michinari Kono  The University of Tokyo Jun Rekimoto  The University of Tokyo & Sony Computer Science Laboratories  Inc.,The availability of digital devices operated by voice is expanding rapidly. However  the applications of voice interfaces are still restricted. For example  speaking in public places becomes an annoyance to the surrounding people  and secret information should not be uttered. Environmental noise may reduce the accuracy of speech recognition. To address these limitations  a system to detect a user's unvoiced utterance is proposed. From internal information observed by an ultrasonic imaging sensor attached to the underside of the jaw  our proposed system recognizes the utterance contents without the user's uttering voice. Our proposed deep neural network model is used to obtain acoustic features from a sequence of ultrasound images. We confirmed that audio signals generated by our system can control the existing smart speakers. We also observed that a user can adjust their oral movement to learn and improve the accuracy of their voice recognition.
273,VoiceAssist: Guiding Users to High-Quality Voice Recordings,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Prem Seetharaman  Northwestern University Gautham J. Mysore  Adobe Research Bryan Pardo  Northwestern University Paris Smaragdis  University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Celso Gomes  Adobe Research,Voice recording is a challenging task with many pitfalls due to sub-par recording environments  mistakes in recording setup  microphone quality  etc. Newcomers to voice recording often have difficulty recording their voice  leading to recordings with low sound quality. Many amateur recordings of poor quality have two key problems: too much reverberation (echo)  and too much background noise (e.g. fans  electronics  street noise). We present VoiceAssist  a system that helps inexperienced users produce high quality recordings by providing real-time visual feedback on audio quality. We integrate modern audio quality measures into an interactive human-machine feedback loop  so that the audio quality can be maximized at capture-time. We demonstrate the utility of this feedback for improving the recording quality with a user study. When presented with visual feedback about recording quality  users produced recordings that were strongly preferred by third-party listeners  when compared to recordings made without this feedback.
274,Vocal Shortcuts for Creative Experts,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Yea-Seul Kim  University of Washington Mira Dontcheva  Adobe Research Eytan Adar  University of Michigan Jessica Hullman  Northwestern University,Vocal shortcuts  short spoken phrases to control interfaces  have the potential to reduce cognitive and physical costs of interactions. They may benefit expert users of creative applications (e.g.  designers  illustrators) by helping them maintain creative focus. To aid the design of vocal shortcuts and gather use cases and design guidelines for speech interaction  we interviewed ten creative experts. Based on our findings  we built VoiceCuts  a prototype implementation of vocal shortcuts in the context of an existing creative application. In contrast to other speech interfaces  VoiceCuts targets experts' unique needs by handling short and partial commands and leverages document model and application context to disambiguate user utterances. We report on the viability and limitations of our approach based on feedback from creative experts.
275,VARI-SOUND: A Varifocal Lens for Sound,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Gianluca Memoli  University of Sussex Letizia Chisari  University of Sussex Jonathan P. Eccles  University of Sussex Mihai Caleap  University of Bristol Bruce W. Drinkwater  University of Bristol Sriram Subramanian  University of Sussex,"Centuries of development in optics have given us passive devices (i.e. lenses  mirrors and filters) to enrich audience immersivity with light effects  but there is nothing similar for sound. Beam-forming in concert halls and outdoor gigs still requires a large number of speakers  while headphones are still the state-of-the-art for personalized audio immersivity in VR. In this work  we show how 3D printed acoustic meta-surfaces  assembled into the equivalent of optical systems  may offer a different solution. We demonstrate how to build them and how to use simple design tools  like the thin-lens equation  also for sound. We present some key acoustic devices  like a ""collimator""  to transform a standard computer speaker into an acoustic ""spotlight""; and a ""magnifying glass""  to create sound sources coming from distinct locations than the speaker itself. Finally  we demonstrate an acoustic varifocal lens  discussing applications equivalent to auto-focus cameras and VR headsets and the limitations of the technology."
276,Engaging High School Students in Cameroon with Exam Practice Quizzes via SMS and WhatsApp,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Anthony Poon  Cornell University Sarah Giroux  Cornell University Parfait Eloundou-Enyegue  Cornell University François Guimbretière  Cornell University Nicola Dell  Cornell Tech,We created a quiz-based intervention to help secondary school students in Cameroon with exam practice. We sent regularly-spaced  multiple-choice questions to students' own mobile devices and examined factors which influenced quiz participation. These quizzes were delivered via either SMS or WhatsApp per each student's preference. We conducted a 3-week deployment with 546 students at 3 schools during their month of independent study prior to their graduating exam. We found that participation rates were heavily impacted by trust in the intervening organization and perceptions of personal security in the socio-technical environment. Parents also played a key gate-keeping role on students' digital activities. We describe how this role - along with different perceptions of smartphones versus basic phones - may manifest in lower participation rates among WhatsApp-based users as compared to SMS. Finally  we discuss design implications for future educational interventions that target students' personal cellphones outside of the classroom.
277,Voice-Based Quizzes for Measuring Knowledge Retention in Under-Connected Populations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Agha Ali Raza  Information Technology University Zain Tariq  Information Technology University Shan Randhawa  Information Technology University Bilal Saleem  Information Technology University Awais Athar  European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) Umar Saif  Information Technology University Roni Rosenfeld  Carnegie Mellon University,Information dissemination using automated phone calls allows reaching low-literate and tech-naive populations. Open challenges include rapid verification of expected knowledge gaps in the community  dissemination of specific information to address these gaps  and follow-up measurement of knowledge retention. We report Sawaal  a voice-based telephone service that uses audio-quizzes to address these challenges. Sawaal allows its open community of users to post and attempt multiple-choice questions and to vote and comment on them. Sawaal spreads virally as users challenge friends to quiz competitions. Administrator-posted questions allow confirming specific knowledge gaps  spreading correct information and measuring knowledge retention via rephrased  repeated questions. In 14 weeks and with no advertisement  Sawaal reached 3 433 users (120 119 calls) in Pakistan  who contributed 13 276 questions that were attempted 455 158 times by 2 027 users. Knowledge retention remained significant for up to two weeks. Surveys revealed that 71% of the mostly low-literate  young  male users were blind.
278,Freedom to Personalize My Digital Classroom: Understanding Teachers' Practices and Motivations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Laton Vermette  Simon Fraser University Joanna McGrenere  University of British Columbia Colin Birge  Microsoft Corporation Adam Kelly  Microsoft Corporation Parmit K. Chilana  Simon Fraser University,Although modern classrooms are increasingly moving towards digital immersion and personalized learning  we have few insights into K-12 teachers' current practices  motivations  and barriers in setting up their digital classroom ecosystems. We interviewed 20 teachers on their process of discovering and integrating a vast range of productivity software and educational platforms in their classrooms  with a particular focus on how they personalize the UI and content of these tools (e.g.  with plugins  templates  or option menus). We found that teachers largely depended on their own experimentation and professional circles to find  personalize  and troubleshoot software tools to support student needs or their own preferences. Teachers were often hesitant to attempt more advanced personalizations due to concerns over student confusion and increased troubleshooting load. We derive several design implications for HCI to better support teachers in sharing their personalized setups and helping their students benefit from digital immersion.
279,Designing Interactive 3D Printed Models with Teachers of the Visually Impaired,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Lei Shi  Cornell University Holly Lawson  Portland State University Zhuohao Zhang  Zhejiang University Shiri Azenkot  Cornell University & Cornell Tech,Students with visual impairments struggle to learn various concepts in the academic curriculum because diagrams  images  and other visual are not accessible to them. To address this  researchers have design interactive 3D printed models (I3Ms) that provide audio descriptions when a user touches components of a model. In prior work  I3Ms were designed on an ad hoc basis  and it is currently unknown what general guidelines produce effective I3M designs. To address this gap  we conducted two studies with Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVIs). First  we led two design workshops with 35 TVIs  who modified sample models and added interactive elements to them. Second  we worked with three TVIs to design three I3Ms in an iterative instructional design process. At the end of this process  the TVIs used the I3Ms we designed to teach their students. We conclude that I3Ms should (1) have effective tactile features (e.g.  distinctive patterns between components)  (2) contain both auditory and visual content (e.g.  explanatory animations)  and (3) consider pedagogical methods (e.g.  overview before details).
280,How Users Interpret Bugs in Trigger-Action Programming,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Will Brackenbury  University of Chicago Abhimanyu Deora  University of Chicago Jillian Ritchey  University of Chicago Jason Vallee  University of Chicago Weijia He  University of Chicago Guan Wang  Brown University Michael L. Littman  Brown University Blase Ur  University of Chicago,Trigger-action programming (TAP) is a programming model enabling users to connect services and devices by writing if-then rules. As such systems are deployed in increasingly complex scenarios  users must be able to identify programming bugs and reason about how to fix them. We first systematize the temporal paradigms through which TAP systems could express rules. We then identify ten classes of TAP programming bugs related to control flow  timing  and inaccurate user expectations. We report on a 153-participant online study where participants were assigned to a temporal paradigm and shown a series of pre-written TAP rules. Half of the rules exhibited bugs from our ten bug classes. For most of the bug classes  we found that the presence of a bug made it harder for participants to correctly predict the behavior of the rule. Our findings suggest directions for better supporting end-user programmers.
281,Evaluating the Effect of Feedback from Different Computer Vision Processing Stages: A Comparative Lab Study,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Jacob Kittley-Davies  University of Southampton Ahmed Alqaraawi  University College London Rayoung Yang  University College London Enrico Costanza  University College London Alex Rogers  University of Oxford Sebastian Stein  University of Southampton,Computer vision and pattern recognition are increasingly being employed by smartphone and tablet applications targeted at lay-users. An open design challenge is to make such systems intelligible without requiring users to become technical experts. This paper reports a lab study examining the role of visual feedback. Our findings indicate that the stage of processing from which feedback is derived plays an important role in users' ability to develop coherent and correct understandings of a system's operation. Participants in our study showed a tendency to misunderstand the meaning being conveyed by the feedback  relating it to processing outcomes and higher level concepts  when in reality the feedback represented low level features. Drawing on the experimental results and the qualitative data collected  we discuss the challenges of designing interactions around pattern matching algorithms.

Bennett  Microsoft Kori Inkpen  Microsoft Jaime Teevan  Microsoft Ruth Kikin-Gil  Microsoft Eric Horvitz  Microsoft,Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades  but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge  highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations  we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies  and to researchers interested in the further development of human-AI interaction design principles.
283,Toward Algorithmic Accountability in Public Services: A Qualitative Study of Affected Community Perspectives on Algorithmic Decision-making in Child Welfare Services,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Anna Brown  College of Creative Arts  Massey University Alexandra Chouldechova  Carnegie Mellon University & Microsoft Research Emily Putnam-Hornstein  University of Southern California Andrew Tobin  College of Creative Arts  Massey University Rhema Vaithianathan  Auckland University of Technology,Algorithmic decision-making systems are increasingly being adopted by government public service agencies. Researchers  policy experts  and civil rights groups have all voiced concerns that such systems are being deployed without adequate consideration of potential harms  disparate impacts  and public accountability practices. Yet little is known about the concerns of those most likely to be affected by these systems. We report on workshops conducted to learn about the concerns of affected communities in the context of child welfare services. The workshops involved 83 study participants including families involved in the child welfare system  employees of child welfare agencies  and service providers. Our findings indicate that general distrust in the existing system contributes significantly to low comfort in algorithmic decision-making. We identify strategies for improving comfort through greater transparency and improved communication strategies. We discuss the implications of our study for accountable algorithm design for child welfare applications.

285,SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award: A Quantified Past,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Forth,Chris Elsden  Northumbria University,A 'data-driven life' has become an established feature of present and future technological visions. This dissertation interrogates the human experience of a data-driven life  by conceptualising  investigating  and speculating about personal informatics tools as new technologies of memory. I argue that the prevalence of quantified data and metrics is creating fundamentally new and distinct records of everyday life: a 'quantified past'. To address this  I conducted qualitative and idiographic fieldwork -- with long-term self-trackers  and subsequently with users of 'smart journals' -- to investigate how this data-driven record mediates the experience of remembering. Further  I undertook a speculative and design-led inquiry to explore the context of a 'quantified wedding'. Adopting a context where remembering is centrally valued  this Research through Design project demonstrated opportunities for the design of data-driven tools for remembering. Crucially  while speculative  this project maintained a central focus on individual experience  and introduced an innovative methodological approach 'Speculative Enactments' for engaging participants meaningfully in speculative inquiry.
286,SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award: Assignment Problems for Optimizing Text Input,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Forth,Anna Maria Feit  ETH Zurich,Text input methods are an integral part of our daily interaction with digital devices. However  their design poses a complex problem: for any method  we must decide which input action (a button press  a hand gesture  etc.) produces which symbol (e.g.  a character or word). With only 26 symbols and input actions  there are already more than 1026 distinct solutions  making it impossible to find the best one through manual design. Prior work has shown that we can use optimization methods to search such large design spaces efficiently and automatically find a good user interface with respect to the given objectives [6]. However  work in the text entry domain has been limited mostly to the performance optimization of (soft-)keyboards (see [2] for an overview). The Ph.D. thesis [2] advances the field of text-entry optimization by enlarging the space of optimizable text-input methods and proposing new criteria for assessing their optimality. Firstly  the design problem is formulated as an assignment problem for integer programming. This enables the use of standard mathematical solvers and algorithms for efficiently finding good solutions. Then  objective functions are developed  for assessing their optimality with respect to motor performance  ergonomics  and learnability. The corresponding models extend beyond interaction with soft keyboards  to consider multi-finger input  novel sensors  and alternative form factors. In addition  the thesis illustrates how to formulate models from prior work in terms of an assignment problem  providing a coherent theoretical basis for text entry optimization. The proposed objectives are applied in the optimization of three assignment problems: text input with multi-finger gestures in mid-air [8]  text input on a long piano keyboard [4]  and – for a contribution to the official French keyboard standard – input of special characters via a physical keyboard [3]. Combining the proposed models offers a multi-objective optimization approach able to capture the complex cognitive and motor processes during typing. . .
287,SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award: On-World Computing,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Forth,Robert Xiao  University of British Columbia,"Computers are now ubiquitous. However  computers and digital content have remained largely separate from the physical world – users explicitly interact with computers through small screens and input devices  and the ""virtual world"" of digital content has had very little overlap with the practical  physical world. My thesis work is concerned with helping computing escape the confines of screens and devices  spilling digital content out onto the physical world around us. In this way  I aim to help bridge the gap between the information-rich digital world and the familiar environment of the physical world and allow users to interact with digital content as they would ordinary physical content. I approach this problem from many angles: from the low-level work of providing high-fidelity touch interaction on everyday surfaces  easily transforming these surfaces into enormous touchscreens; to high-level questions surrounding the interaction design between physical and virtual realms. To achieve this end  building on my prior work  I developed two physical embodiments of this new mixed-reality design: a tiny  miniaturized projector and camera system providing the hardware basis for a projected on-world interface  and a head-mounted augmented-reality head-mounted display modified to support touch interaction on arbitrary surfaces."
288,The Adventures of Older Authors: Exploring Futures through Co-Design Fictions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Gala,Aloha Hufana Ambe  Queensland University of Technology Margot Brereton  Queensland University of Technology Alessandro Soro  Queensland University of Technology Laurie Buys  Queensland University of Technology Paul Roe  Queensland University of Technology,"This paper presents co-design fiction as an approach to engaging users in imagining  envisioning and speculating not just on future technology but future life through co-created fictional works. Design fiction in research is often created or written by researchers. There is relatively little critical discussion of how to co-create design fictions with end-users  with the concomitant opportunities and challenges this poses. To fill this gap in knowledge  we conducted co-design fiction workshops with nine older creative writers  utilising prompts to inspire discussion and engage their imaginative writing about the trend towards tracking and monitoring older people. Their stories revealed futures of neither dystopia nor utopia but of social and moral dilemmas narrating their wish not just to ""maintain their independence""  but a palpable desire for adventure and very nuanced senses of how they wish to take control. We discuss inherent tensions in the control of the co-design fiction process; balancing the author's need for freedom and creativity with the researcher's desire to guide the process toward the design investigation at hand."
289,HawkEye – Deploying a Design Fiction Probe,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Gala,Renee Noortman  Eindhoven University of Technology Britta F. Schulte  University College London Paul Marshall  University of Bristol Saskia Bakker  Eindhoven University of Technology Anna L. Cox  University College London,This paper explores how a design fiction can be designed to be used as a pragmatic user-centred design method to generate insights on future technology use. We built HawkEye  a design fiction probe that embodies a future fiction of dementia care. To learn how participants respond to the probe  we employed it with eight participants for three weeks in their own homes as well as evaluating it with six HCI experts in sessions of 1.5h. In addition to presenting the probe in detail  we share insights into the process of building it and discuss the utility of design fiction as a tool to elicit empathetic and rich discussions about potential outcomes of future technologies.
290,Smart Home Security Cameras and Shifting Lines of Creepiness: A Design-Led Inquiry,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Gala,James Pierce  California College of the Arts & University of California  Berkeley,Through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras  this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. Digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared  stolen  and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. Hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data  devices  and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them  often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. Foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology  thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. Developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations  this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security  anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use  and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.
291,What is Fair Shipping  Anyway?: Using Design Fiction to Raise Ethical Awareness in an Industrial Context,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Gala,Yiying Wu  Aalto University Sus Lyckvi  Chalmers University of Technology Virpi Roto  Aalto University,The HCI community cares for the human and social aspects of technologies. Ethical discussion on the social implications of new technologies often happen among researchers  but it is important to raise this discussion also in the industry that designs and implements new systems. In this paper  we introduce a case in which design fiction was used as an ethical discussion tool among company partners. We report the process of creating and prototyping a fictional world embedded with conflicting values that aimed to shift the focus from industrial merits towards societal values and raise discussion among participants. Moreover  we examine the challenges and propose suggestions in crafting critiques and friction to the industrial context. Our findings suggest why and how one should use design fiction as a means to raise ethical awareness in a technology- and profit-focused context  to support further activities on developing more humane technological futures.
292,Increasing the Transparency of Research Papers with Explorable Multiverse Analyses,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Pierre Dragicevic  Inria Yvonne Jansen  CNRS – Sorbonne Université Abhraneel Sarma  University of Michigan Matthew Kay  University of Michigan Fanny Chevalier  University of Toronto,We present explorable multiverse analysis reports  a new approach to statistical reporting where readers of research papers can explore alternative analysis options by interacting with the paper itself. This approach draws from two recent ideas: i) multiverse analysis  a philosophy of statistical reporting where paper authors report the outcomes of many different statistical analyses in order to show how fragile or robust their findings are; and ii) explorable explanations  narratives that can be read as normal explanations but where the reader can also become active by dynamically changing some elements of the explanation. Based on five examples and a design space analysis  we show how combining those two ideas can complement existing reporting approaches and constitute a step towards more transparent research papers.
293,Cross-Device Taxonomy: Survey  Opportunities and Challenges of Interactions Spanning Across Multiple Devices,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Frederik Brudy  University College London Christian Holz  Microsoft Research Roman Rädle  Aarhus University Chi-Jui Wu  Lancaster University Steven Houben  Lancaster University Clemens Klokmose  Aarhus University Nicolai Marquardt  University College London,Designing interfaces or applications that move beyond the bounds of a single device screen enables new ways to engage with digital content. Research addressing the opportunities and challenges of interactions with multiple devices in concert is of continued focus in HCI research. To inform the future research agenda of this field  we contribute an analysis and taxonomy of a corpus of 510 papers in the cross-device computing domain. For both new and experienced researchers in the field we provide: an overview  historic trends and unified terminology of cross-device research; discussion of major and under-explored application areas; mapping of enabling technologies; synthesis of key interaction techniques spanning across multiple devices; and review of common evaluation strategies. We close with a discussion of open issues. Our taxonomy aims to create a unified terminology and common understanding for researchers in order to facilitate and stimulate future cross-device research.
294,Anchoring Effects and Troublesome Asymmetric Transfer in Subjective Ratings,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Andy Cockburn  University of Canterbury Carl Gutwin  University of Saskatchewan,Within-subjects experiments are prone to asymmetric transfer  which confounds results interpretation. While HCI researchers routinely test asymmetric transfer in objective data  doing so for subjective data is rare. Yet literature suggests that anchoring effects should make subjective measures particularly susceptible to asymmetric transfer. We report on four analyses of NASA-TLX data from four previously published HCI papers  with four main findings. First  asymmetric transfer is common  occurring in 42% of tests analysed. Second  the data conforms to predictions of anchoring effects. Third  the magnitude of the anchor's effect correlates with the magnitude of the difference between the interface ratings -- that is  the anchor's 'pull' correlates with the anchoring stimulus. Fourth  several of the previously published findings are changed when data are reanalysed using between-subjects treatment. We urge caution when analysing within-subjects subjective measures and recommend that researchers test for and report the occurrence of asymmetric transfer.
295,Touchstone2: An Interactive Environment for Exploring Trade-offs in HCI Experiment Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Alexander Eiselmayer  University of Zurich Chat Wacharamanotham  University of Zurich Michel Beaudouin-Lafon  Université Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay Wendy E. Mackay  Université Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay,Touchstone2 offers a direct-manipulation interface for generating and examining trade-offs in experiment designs. Based on interviews with experienced researchers  we developed an interactive environment for manipulating experiment design parameters  revealing patterns in trial tables  and estimating and comparing statistical power. We also developed TSL  a declarative language that precisely represents experiment designs. In two studies  experienced HCI researchers successfully used Touchstone2 to evaluate design trade-offs and calculate how many participants are required for particular effect sizes. We discuss Touchstone2's benefits and limitations  as well as directions for future research.
296,The Mental Image Revealed by Gaze Tracking,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Xi Wang  Technische Universität Berlin Andreas Ley  Technische Universität Berlin Sebastian Koch  Technische Universität Berlin David Lindlbauer  Technische Universität Berlin & ETH Zurich James Hays  Georgia Institute of Technology Kenneth Holmqvist  Universität Regensburg Marc Alexa  Technische Universität Berlin,Humans involuntarily move their eyes when retrieving an image from memory. This motion is often similar to actually observing the image. We suggest to exploit this behavior as a new modality in human computer interaction  using the motion of the eyes as a descriptor of the image. Interaction requires the user's eyes to be tracked but no voluntary physical activity. We perform a controlled experiment and develop matching techniques using machine learning to investigate if images can be discriminated based on the gaze patterns recorded while users merely think about image. Our results indicate that image retrieval is possible with an accuracy significantly above chance. We also show that this result generalizes to images not used during training of the classifier and extends to uncontrolled settings in a realistic scenario.
297,An Explanation of Fitts' Law-like Performance in Gaze-Based Selection Tasks Using a Psychophysics Approach,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Immo Schuetz  Facebook Reality Labs T. Scott Murdison  Facebook Reality Labs Kevin J. MacKenzie  Facebook Reality Labs Marina Zannoli  Facebook Reality Labs,"Eye gaze as an input method has been studied since the 1990s  to varied results: some studies found gaze to be more efficient than traditional input methods like a mouse  others far behind. Comparisons are often backed up by Fitts' Law without explicitly acknowledging the ballistic nature of saccadic eye movements. Using a vision science-inspired model  we here show that a Fitts'-like distribution of movement times can arise due to the execution of secondary saccades  especially when targets are small. Study participants selected circular targets using gaze. Seven different target sizes and two saccade distances were used. We then determined performance across target sizes for different sampling windows (""dwell times"") and predicted an optimal dwell time range. Best performance was achieved for large targets reachable by a single saccade. Our findings highlight that Fitts' Law  while a suitable approximation in some cases  is an incomplete description of gaze interaction dynamics."

We present CodeGazer  a prototype for source code navigation using eye gaze for common navigation functions. These functions include actions such as ""Go to Definition'' and ""Find All Usages'' of an identifier  navigate to files and methods  move back and forth between visited points in code and scrolling. We present user study results showing that many users liked and even preferred the gaze-based navigation  in particular the ""Go to Definition'' function. Gaze-based navigation is also holding up well in completion time when compared to traditional methods. We discuss how eye gaze can be integrated into traditional mouse & keyboard applications in order to make ""look up'' tasks more natural."
299,ReType: Quick Text Editing with Keyboard and Gaze,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Shyamli Sindhwani  University of Auckland Christof Lutteroth  University of Bath Gerald Weber  University of Auckland,When a user needs to reposition the cursor during text editing  this is often done using the mouse. For experienced typists especially  the switch between keyboard and mouse can slow down the keyboard editing workflow considerably. To address this we propose ReType  a new gaze-assisted positioning technique combining keyboard with gaze input based on a new 'patching' metaphor. ReType allows users to perform some common editing operations while keeping their hands on the keyboard. We present the result of two studies. A free-use study indicated that ReType enhances the user experience of text editing. ReType was liked by many participants  regardless of their typing skills. A comparative user study showed that ReType is able to match or even beat the speed of mouse-based interaction for small text edits. We conclude that the gaze-augmented user interface can make common interactions more fluent  especially for professional keyboard users.
300,Mini Living Lab: Improving Retention and Success for Women in Tech and Diverse Teams Through Redesigning the Critique Process,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Island A CROWNE,Karen Holtzblatt  InContext Enterprises Michael Ahmadi  University of Siegen Anne Weibert  University of Siegen Nicola Marsden  Heilbronn University,Gender disparity in high tech is a long-standing challenge. The number of women in tech is lower than 30 years ago; women leave the field 50% more often than men; attrition costs companies money and talent. This SIG addresses the issue of gender and retention by changing key work practices. As a maker community critique  giving and receiving feedback on one's work  is a necessary and everyday experience. Yet especially women lose self esteem when criticized. Since HCI professionals are key participants in critique it is a good place to start improving interactions within diverse teams. In this SIG we engage the community in a critical examination and reinvention of the critique process. Using a Mini Living Lab format  participants share experiences of their critique practices  brainstorm improvements  and try them out with a practice problem. The organizers share insights from their Living Lab company-research partnerships addressing gender and retention.
301,Online Grocery Delivery Services: An Opportunity to Address Food Disparities in Transportation-scarce Areas,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Lomond,Tawanna R. Dillahunt  University of Michigan Sylvia Simioni  University of Michigan Xuecong Xu  University of Michigan,Online grocery delivery services present new opportunities to address food disparities  especially in underserved areas. However  such services have not been systematically evaluated. This study evaluates such services' potential to provide healthy-food access and influence healthy-food purchases among individuals living in transportation-scarce and low-resource areas. We conducted a pilot experiment with 20 participants consisting of a randomly assigned group's 1-month use of an online grocery delivery service  and a control group's 1-month collection of grocery receipts  and a set of semi-structured interviews. We found that online grocery delivery services (a) serve as a feasible model to healthy-food access if they are affordable and amenable to multiple payment forms and (b) could lead to healthier selections. We contribute policy recommendations to bolster affordability of healthy-food access and design opportunities to promote healthy foods to support the adoption and use of these services among low-resource and transportation-scarce groups.
302,Reading Face  Reading Health: Exploring Face Reading Technologies for Everyday Health,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Lomond,Xianghua Ding  Fudan University Yanqi Jiang  Fudan University Xiankang Qin  Fudan University Yunan Chen  University of California  Irvine Wenqiang Zhang  Fudan University Lizhe Qi  Fudan University,With the recent advancement in computer vision  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  and mobile technologies  it has become technically feasible for computerized Face Reading Technologies (FRTs) to learn about one's health in everyday settings. However  how to design FRT-based applications for everyday health practices remains unexplored. This paper presents a design study with a technology probe called Faced  a mobile health checkup application based on the facial diagnosis method from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). A field trial of Faced with 10 participants suggests potential usage modes and highlights a number of critical design issues in the use of FRTs for everyday health  including adaptability  practicality  sensitivity  and trustworthiness. We end by discussing design implications to address the unique challenges of fully integrating FRTs into everyday health practices.

Many different mobile apps for breaking ""smartphone addiction"" and achieving ""digital wellbeing"" are available. However  it is still not clear whether and how such solutions work. Which functionality do they have? Are they effective and appreciated? Do they have a relevant impact on users' behavior? To answer these questions  (i) we reviewed the features of 42 digital wellbeing apps  (ii) we performed a thematic analysis on 1 128 user reviews of such apps  and (iii) we conducted a 3-week-long in-the-wild study of Socialize  an app that includes the most common digital wellbeing features  with 38 participants. We discovered that digital wellbeing apps are appreciated and useful for some specific situations. However  they do not promote the formation of new habits and they are perceived as not restrictive enough  thus not effectively helping users to change their behavior with smartphones."
304,Beyond Behavior: The Coach's Perspective on Technology in Health Coaching,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Lomond,Heleen Rutjes  Eindhoven University of Technology Martijn C. Willemsen  Eindhoven University of Technology Wijnand A. IJsselsteijn  Technical university of Eindhoven,Rapid innovations in electronic healthcare and behavior tracking systems are challenging health coaches (dietitians  personal trainers  etc.) to rethink their traditional roles and healthcare practices. At the same time  many current e-coaching systems have been developed without explicitly incorporating the healthcare professionals' perspective into the design process. In the current paper  we present three consecutive qualitative studies  starting from the health coach's perspective on successful coaching  progressively zooming in on the potential role and impact of technology as part of the coaching process. Our main finding is that coaches are concerned that introducing technology in the coaching process puts too much emphasis on behavioral information  lowering the attention for the client's lived experience  while understanding those experiences is key for successful coaching. We summarize our insights in a multi-channel communication model and draw implications for the design of supporting technology in health coaching.
305,SRC01: Can Changes in Heart Rate Variability Represented in Sound be Identified by Non-Medical Experts?,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Mariam Bahameish  Queen Mary University of London,Heart rate variability (HRV) has become a wide-spread area for the investigation of the health and stress states of individuals. This paper aims at exploring the effectiveness of representing HRV measures with alternative modalities  other than visual displays  such as audio or haptics. Therefore  we undertook a preliminary study in which we applied a parameter mapping sonification approach to transform the HRV signal into an audible form. In this work  we sought to evaluate the human perception of the developed auditory interface. Hence  a dataset that involves interbeat interval measurements of individuals experiencing changes in mental state in the form of meditation was selected as the basis of the study. The HRV parameters of the dataset were mapped to acoustic features using a linear mapping technique. The feasibility of the system was assessed by measuring the learnability  performance  latency  and confidence aspects. The results suggest a great potential of incorporating auditory displays in the analysis of HRV. Participants were able to distinguish the different meditation states and types with minimal training time. However  further studies should be conducted on a larger population to provide verification of the findings of this preliminary study.
306,SRC02: Muse: Scaffolding Metacognitive Reflection in Design-Based Research,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Victoria Cabales  Northwestern University,While learning science research has explored approaches improving students' problem solving skills by introducing tools that support students in metacognitive reflection  this work has focused on problems with clear solutions  rather than addressing the question of how metacognitive reflection can help students develop their self-regulation skills  which help students understand and control their learning environment through planning  practice  and self-evaluation. This paper presents Muse  an in-action chatbot interface that prompts students to reflect metacognitively on their self-direction process in the midst of working on their independent research projects. Students participate in the Design  Technology  and Research (DTR) program  which provides several undergrads the opportunity to self-direct an independent research project by using the socio-technological model Agile Research Studios (ARS). Results from a case study suggest that Muse helps students identify time consuming habits and set aside less important tasks by giving participants the opportunity to act on their reflections and adjust aspects of their process that they deem less effective.
307,SRC03: Guidelines for Combining Storytelling and Gamification: Which Features Would Teenagers Desire to Have a More Enjoyable Museum Experience?,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Vanessa Cesário  University of Porto & Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute,While museums are often designed to engage and interest a wide variety of audiences  teenagers are a neglected segment. This PhD research in Digital Media explores how digital technologies can facilitate natural history museums in creating immersive museum experiences for teenagers (15–18 years old)  especially through digital storytelling and gamification frameworks. This contribution would be a set of guidelines that will aid in designing interactive experiences inside these museums. So far  we have involved a total of 155 teens through co-design sessions  130 in focus groups  and 98 in usability studies  as well as 3 museums  12 curators  and 17 master students. Through qualitative analysis  our preliminary findings suggest that teenagers value gamification and storytelling elements when thinking about enjoyable museum tours  while curators value story-based narratives as the most prominent method to provide enjoyable museum experience for teens. Based on the findings identified  and in collaboration with the Madeira-ITI  two interactive mobile experiences targeted at teenagers were developed for the Natural History Museum of Funchal  Portugal.
308,SRC04: Understanding the Occupational Therapists Method to Inform the Design of Technologies for People with Dementia,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Emma Dixon  University of Maryland  College Park,This paper describes a PhD research project involving people with dementia and practitioners who work primarily with people with dementia to support engagement in meaningful activities and activities of everyday living. The aim of this work is to develop a technology which adapts to changing cognitive demands of people with dementia in order to facilitate continuous engagement in meaningful activities. In depth  semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners to understand their methods for personalization of activities and the implications for design of future adaptive technologies. Preliminary results from interviews with Occupational Therapists are presented.
309,SRC05: Lake: A Digital Wizard of Oz Prototyping Tool,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Andrew Finke  Northwestern University,Mobile app designers aim to develop the best mobile software interfaces in the least amount of time  and rely on testing ideas with prototypes in lieu of building costly  fully functioning applications. Yet  designers cannot effectively prototype some complex app experiences  including augmented reality applications like Pokémon GO  because existing tools lack the needed features  or because prototyping in them is too time intensive to be feasible. To solve this problem  we introduce Lake  a mobile application prototyping tool that enables the creation of complex mobile applications with the same ease as paper prototyping. By leveraging the Wizard of Oz technique used in paper prototyping in our digital medium  we enable designers to prototype at the same low cost as paper  but at a much higher fidelity. Through a pilot study (N=6)  we find that designers are able to gather organic in-context feedback from complex prototypes made with Lake.
310,SRC06: Automatic Speech Recognition Services: Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Usability,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Abraham Glasser  Rochester Institute of Technology,Nowadays  speech is becoming a more common  if not standard  interface to technology. This can be seen in the trend of technology changes over the years. Increasingly  voice is used to control programs  appliances and personal devices within homes  cars  workplaces  and public spaces through smartphones and home assistant devices using Amazon's Alexa  Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri  and other proliferating technologies. However  most speech interfaces are not accessible for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) people. In this paper  performances of current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with voices of DHH speakers are evaluated. ASR has improved over the years  and is able to reach Word Error Rates (WER) as low as 5-6% [1][2][3]  with the help of cloud-computing and machine learning algorithms that take in custom vocabulary models. In this paper  a custom vocabulary model is used  and the significance of the improvement is evaluated when using DHH speech.
311,SRC07: Affordable Smart Wheelchair,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Isabella Gomez Torres  University of California  San Diego Gaurav Parmar  University of California  San Diego Sammarth Aggarwal  University of California  San Diego Nathaniel Mansur  University of California  San Diego Alec Guthrie  University California  San Diego,Power wheelchairs (PW) are an example of an assistive technology in that they are used to increase  maintain  or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities [6]. As seen in [5] [3]  the commercially available products do not provide any assistance beyond enhanced mobility. Furthermore  existing PW research fails at comprehensively noting an individual's challenges  such as navigating through narrow passages or fixing their broken wheelchairs. Instead  they focus mostly on novel interaction methods such as BCI  head and gaze control [9] [15]. In this paper  we explore these individual needs and show that PWs have the novel potential to become a smart wheelchair at an affordable price. Our research follows the double diamond (DD) process [2] and relies on the participatory design (PD) methodology [7]  which addresses all stakeholders involved. Namely  we consider individuals with wheelchairs  the assistive technology research community  and the PW industry. For further insight we also contacted medical doctors  healthcare professionals  and non- profit organizations. We spent time getting to know these communities through interviews  surveys  demonstrations  and continuous user inputs  aligning our work to the PD tools. We found that individuals using wheelchairs overall desire safety  accessibility  and a durable design. Guided by these results  we designed a proof of concept (POC) system called the Affordable Smart Wheelchair (ASW) for indoor use. This kit implements full-autonomy in the form of indoor navigation from one room to another and to predetermined docking locations through voice control. It also has semi-autonomous functions in the form of manual joystick control augmented with real-time collision avoidance and staircase detection.
312,SRC08: Math Graphs for the Visually Impaired: Audio Presentation of Elements of Mathematical Graphs,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jeongyeon Kim  Sogang University Yoonah Lee  Sogang University Inho Seo  Sogang University,The sense of sight takes a dominating role in learning mathematical graphs. Most visually impaired students drop out of mathematics because necessary content is inaccessible. Sonification and auditory graphs have been the primary methods of representing data through sound. However  the representation of mathematical elements of graphs is still unexplored. The experiments in this paper investigate optimal methods for representing mathematical elements of graphs with sound. The results indicate that the methods of design in this study are effective for describing mathematical elements of graphs  such as axes  quadrants and differentiability. These findings can help visually impaired learners to be more independent  and also facilitate further studies on assistive technology.
313,SRC09: I Am What You Eat: Effects of Social Influence on Meal Selection Online,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Maria D. Molina  Pennsylvania State University,The availability of mHealth technologies has increased exponentially  particularly fitness and calorie tracking applications. Recent studies and anecdotal evidence has highlighted the potential of these technologies to serve as tools of bad eating behavior due to its focus on self-monitoring and calorie counting. The current research investigates on the potential of using social-orienting features of technology  specifically bandwagon and identity cues  to incentivize food-based nutrition (FBN) rather than a calorie-only approach. For this purpose  a 2 x 2 mixed factorial online experiment was conducted with bandwagon cue as a within-subject factor and identity cue as a between-subject factor. Results reveal that 67.6% of participants selected high bandwagon cue meals  regardless of its nutritional value. Bandwagon perception was the only significant predictor of meal selection  indicating that an increase in one unit improved the odds of an individual choosing a high bandwagon meal by 69%.
314,SRC10: Designing Compassion Cultivating Interactions for New Mothers,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Annu Sible Prabhakar  University of Cincinnati & Indiana University,This paper describes a research project that aims to examine an unexplored design space-compassion cultivation for wellness. This project seeks to understand the components of compassionate interactions between new mothers and their proximate and primary supporters-partners -- to inform the design of compassion cultivating interventions for maternal wellness. A discussion of research activities undertaken thus far and preliminary results are presented.
315,SRC11: Family-Centered Exploration of the Benefits and Burdens of Digital Home Assistants,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Olivia K. Richards  Pennsylvania State University,Parents receive conflicting information on the benefits and burdens of children's technology use  especially novel technologies such as digital home assistants. To understand parents' views  we analyzed relevant Amazon Echo device product reviews posted to Amazon.com  and deployed a User Benefit and Burden Survey to 131 parents on Amazon Mechanical Turk to explore their perspectives of Amazon Echo digital home assistants. Our work explores parents' perceptions of the devices with regards to their children and families  in terms of attributes such as benefits and burdens. This study contributes an empirical  family-centered understanding of and design opportunities for whole home personal assistants in support of a diversity of families.
316,SRC12: Privacy Therapy with Aretha: What If Your Firewall Could Talk?,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,William Seymour  University of Oxford,The rapid adoption of smart home devices has brought with it a widespread lack of understanding amongst users over where their devices send data. Smart home ecosystems represent complex additions to existing wicked problems around network privacy and security in the home. This work presents the Aretha project  a device which combines the functionality of a firewall with the position of voice assistants as the hub of the smart home  and the sophistication of modern conversational voice interfaces. The result is a device which can engage users in conversation about network privacy and security  allowing for the forming and development of complex preferences that Aretha is then able to act upon.
317,SRC13: ParaXplore: Demystifying the Exploration of Large Design Spaces,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Naghmi Shireen  Simon Fraser University,Generative design tools together with large screen displays provide designers an opportunity to explore large numbers of design alternatives. There are numerous design studies on exploring multiple simultaneous designs  but few present interface solutions and system features for such exploration. To the best of my knowledge  no study probes exploring a large design space with multiple simultaneous states. The premise of my research is that  if designers can work directly with large numbers of designs with new representations and tools as part of the design workflow  we should expect new patterns and strategies to emerge and change the design process. Such task environments may present novel actions  task sequences  methods and techniques. What are new actions and techniques that would enable working seamlessly with multiple designs? My research aims to answer this (and similar) questions; and  more specifically  to uncover how designers' augment their work through spatial structuring of the task environment to reduce the cognitive cost of working with multiple simultaneous designs on a large work-surface. I conducted a lab experiment with nine designers. The results suggest design features for new front-end gallery interfaces for managing a large set of design variations while enabling simultaneous editing.
318,SRC14: Sense of Familiarity: Improving Older Adults' Adaptation to Exergames,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Hao Zhang  Nanyang Technological University,Exergames are proven to be effective in helping older adults improve their physical and mental capabilities. However  older adults' maladaptation to exergames may occur due to the complexity of game tasks and interfaces. In this work  we show that familiarity can improve older adults' adaptation to exergames. The results of our first study indicate that older adults with higher level of familiarity to exergames exhibit higher level of motivation and ability. To maximize the effectiveness of exergames  it is helpful to provide older adults exergames which they are more familiar with. To evaluate the familiarity level of exergames  we propose a novel familiarity model with five factors  namely prior experience  positive emotion  repeated time  level of processing  and retention rate. Results from our second study show that the identified five factors have significant positive correlations with familiarity and there is a high positive correlation between familiarity levels and participants' satisfaction to the exergames.
319,SRC15: GPK: An Efficient Special Symbol Input Method for Keyboards,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Xiyuan He  Zhejiang University Zhuohao Zhang  Zhejiang University,We introduce a novel typing technique for special symbols in the keyboard-only environment. The technique  called GPK (Gliding on Physical Keyboard)  consists of two steps for entering special symbols. First  a user draws the special symbol on the keyboard by gliding over keys; Second  the user can select the desired symbol from the predicted symbols generated by GPK. Users can also switch from this mode to normal typing mode. We also present an application of this input technique based on web browsers. A user study with nine participants who are familiar with keyboard input showed the input efficiency of GPK. We compared the typing efficiency of GPK with other special symbol typing methods. We could deploy this method to office environments where users have desktop computers with a keyboard only. It could also inspire future work of integrating this method into word processors  document preparation systems and web environments.
320,DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
321,DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.
322,DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
323,DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,"Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of ""futuring"" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities."
324,DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
325,DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
326,DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
327,DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.
328,DC09: Player Types of Gamers: Critical Evaluation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Suvi K. Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
329,DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
330,DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
331,DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
332,DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
333,DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
334,DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
335,DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
336,DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
337,DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
338,DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.

It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.

342,DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
343,DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,"Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of ""futuring"" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities."
344,DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
345,DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
346,DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
347,DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.
348,DC09: Player Types of Gamers: Critical Evaluation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Suvi K. Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
349,DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
350,DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
351,DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
352,DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
353,DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
354,DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
355,DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
356,DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
357,DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
358,DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.
359,DC20: Co-Designing Digital Technologies to Support Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Cara Wilson  Queensland University of Technology,This doctoral work considers how to best co-design with minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum in classroom contexts. It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.
360,INT001: ScaleDial: A Novel Tangible Device for Teaching Musical Scales & Triads,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Konstantin Klamka  Technische Universität Dresden Jannik Wojnar  Technische Universität Dresden Raimund Dachselt  Technische Universität Dresden,The teaching of harmonic foundations in music is a common learning objective in many education systems. However  music theory is often considered as a non-interactive subject matter that requires huge efforts to understand. With this work  we contribute a novel tangible device  called ScaleDial  that makes use of the relations between geometry and music theory to provide interactive  graspable and playful learning experiences. Therefore  we introduce an innovative tangible cylinder and demonstrate how harmonic relationships can be explored through a physical set of digital manipulatives  that can be arranged and stacked on top of an interactive chromatic circle. Based on the tangible interaction and further rich visual and auditory output capabilities  ScaleDial enables a better understanding of scales  pitch constellations  triads  as well as intervals. Further  we describe the technical realization of our advanced prototype and show how we fabricate the magnetic  capacitive and mechanical sensing.
361,INT002: ClassBeacons: Enhancing Reflection-in-Action of Teachers through Spatially Distributed Ambient Information,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Pengcheng An  Eindhoven University of Technology Saskia Bakker  Eindhoven University of Technology Sara Ordanovski  Utrecht University Ruurd Taconis  Eindhoven University of Technology Chris L. E. Paffen  Utrecht University Berry Eggen  Eindhoven University of Technology,Reflection-in-action (RiA) refers to teachers' reflections on their teaching performance during busy classroom routines. RiA is a demanding competence for teachers  but little has been known about how HCI systems could support teachers' RiA during their busy and intensive teaching. To bridge this gap  we design and evaluate an ambient information system named ClassBeacons. ClassBeacons aims to help teachers intuitively reflect-in-action on how to divide time and attention over pupils throughout a lesson. ClassBeacons subtly depicts teachers' division of time and attention over pupils through multiple light-objects distributed over students' desks. Each light-object indicates how long the teacher has been cumulatively around it (helping an adjacent student) by shifting color. A field evaluation with eleven teachers proved that ClassBeacons enhanced teachers' RiA by supporting their sensemaking of ongoing performance and modification of upcoming actions. Furthermore  ClassBeacons was experienced to unobtrusively fit into teachers' routines without overburdening teaching in progress.
362,INT003: Physical Programming for Blind and Low Vision Children at Scale,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Nicolas Villar  Microsoft Research Cecily Morrison  Microsoft Research Daniel Cletheroe  Microsoft Research Tim Regan  Microsoft Research Anja Thieme  Microsoft Research Greg Saul  Microsoft Research,There is a dearth of appropriate tools for young learners with mixed visual abilities to engage with computational learning. Addressing this gap  we present Project Torino  a physical programming language for teaching computational learning to children ages 7-11 regardless of level of vision. To create code  children connect and manipulate tactile objects to create music  audio stories  or poetry. Designed to be made and deployed at scale  Project Torino (along with a scheme of work) has been successfully used by 30 non-specialist teachers with 75 children across the UK over three months.
363,INT004: StringTouch: A Scalable Low-Cost Concept for Deformable Interfaces,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Beat Rossmy  LMU University of Munich Alexander Wiethoff  LMU University of Munich,This paper describes a demo prototype of a tangible user interface (TUI) concept that is derived from the expressive play of musical string instruments. We translated this interaction paradigm to an interactive demo which offers a novel gesture vocabulary (strumming  picking  etc.). In this work we present our interaction concepts  prototype description  technical details and insights on the rapid and low-cost manufacturing and design process.

364,INT005: Tangible Interactions with Acoustic Levitation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Asier Marzo  Universidad Publica de Navarra Steven Kockaya  University of Bristol Euan Freeman  University of Glasgow Julie Williamson  University of Glasgow,Acoustic Levitation can hold millimetric objects in mid-air without any physical contact. This capability has been exploited to create displays since being able to position mid-air physical voxels enables for rich data representations. However  most of the times interesting features of acoustic levitation are not exploited. Acoustic Levitation is harmless and sound diffracts around objects  thus we can insert our hand inside the levitator and touch the levitated particles without harmful effect on us. In this demo  we showcase more tangible interactions with acoustically levitated particles by passing acoustically-transparent structures through the particles  manipulating particles in mid-air with wearable levitators or by moving multiple particles with direct manipulation. We hope that this demo provides a more tangible experience of acoustic levitation. Since all the presented devices are Do-It-Yourself  we encourage visitors to experiment further with acoustic levitation.
365,INT006: Three-in-one: Levitation  Parametric Audio  and Mid-Air Haptic Feedback,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Gözel Shakeri  University of Glasgow Euan Freeman  University of Glasgow William Frier  University of Sussex Michele Iodice  Ultrahaptics Benjamin Long  Ultrahaptics Ltd Orestis Georgiou  Ultrahaptics Ltd Carl Andersson  Applied Acoustics,Ultrasound enables new types of human-computer interfaces  ranging from auditory and haptic displays to levitation (visual). We demonstrate these capabilities with an ultrasonic phased array that allows users to interactively manipulate levitating objects with mid-air hand gestures whilst also receiving auditory feedback via highly directional parametric audio  and haptic feedback via focused ultrasound onto their bare hands. Therefore  this demo presents the first ever ultrasound rig which conveys information to three different sensory channels and levitates small objects simultaneously.
366,INT007: Demonstration of Refinity: An Interactive Holographic Signage for New Retail Shopping Experience,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jin Ryong Kim  Alibaba Group Stephanie Chan  Alibaba Group Xiangchao Huang  Alibaba Group Kenneth Ng  Alibaba Group Limin Paul Fu  Alibaba Group Chen Zhao  Alibaba Group,This demo presents Refinity - an interactive holographic signage for the new retail shopping experience. In our demo  we show a concept of futuristic shopping experience with a tangible 3D mid-air interface that allows customers to directly select and explore realistic virtual products using autostereoscopic 3D display combined with mid-air haptics and finger tracker. We also present an example of in-store shopping scenario for natural interactions with 3D. This shopping experience will engage users in producing a memorable in-store experience with the merging of digital and physical interactions.
367,INT008: Multimodal Representation of Complex Spatial Data,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Hrishikesh Rao  University of Michigan Sile O'Modhrain  University of Michigan,For blind users  spatial information is often presented in non-spatial form such as electronic speech.We explore the possibility of representing spatial data on refreshable tactile graphic displays in combination with audio feedback and utilizing both static and dynamic tactile information. We demonstrate an implementation of a New York Times style crossword puzzle  providing interactions to query location and stored data  ask for clues in across and down directions  edit and fill in the crossword puzzle using a Perkins style braille keyboard or a typewriter-style keyboard   and verify answers. Through our demonstration  we explore tradeoffs related to available tactile real estate  and overcrowding of the tactile image with a view toward reducing the cognitive workload involved in retaining a working mental model of the active grid  and the time to complete a letter placement task.

Depping  University of Saskatchewan Regan Mandryk  University of Saskatchewan James Collin Fey  University of California  Santa Cruz Katherine Isbister  University of California  Santa Cruz,Social closeness is important for an individual's health and well-being  and this is especially difficult to maintain over a distance. Games can help with this  to connect and strengthen relationships or create new ones by enabling shared playful experiences. The demo proposed is a game we designed called 'In the Same Boat'  a two-player game intended to foster social closeness between players over a distance. We leverage the synchronization of both players' physiological data (heart rate  breathing facial expressions) mapped to an input scheme to control the movement of a canoe down a river.
371,INT012: Slackliner 2.0: Real-time Training Assistance through Life-size Feedback,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Christian Murlowski  DFKI  Saarland Informatics Campus Florian Daiber  DFKI  Saarland Informatics Campus Felix Kosmalla  DFKI  Saarland Informatics Campus Antonio Krüger  DFKI  Saarland Informatics Campus,In this demo  we present Slackliner 2.0  an interactive slackline training assistant which features head and skeleton tracking  and real-time feedback through life-size projection. Like in other sports  proper training leads to a faster increase of skill and lessens the risk of injuries. We chose a set of exercises from slackline literature and implemented an interactive trainer which guides the user through the exercises giving feedback if the exercises were executed correctly. Based on lessons learned from our study and prior demonstrations we present a revised version of Slackliner that uses head tracking to better guide the user's attention and movements. Additionally a new visual indicator informs the trainee about her arm posture during the performance. This has been also included in an updated post-analysis view that provides the trainee with more detailed feedback about her performance. The present demo showcases an interactive sports training system that provides in-situ feedback while following a well-guided learning procedure.

Love  Abertay University Mona Bozdog  Abertay University,Ola De La Vida is a three-player cooperative game installation which is designed to harness the qualities of social play environment such as an arcade or play party (an event which mixes games  music  dance and socializing). Ola De La Vida uses physical and digital design techniques that consider the unique qualities of a social play space being sensitive to the complex personal  social and interpersonal aspects each player may experience. The game installation uses its scale to heighten the visibility of the game in a crowded play space  custom control methods to lower barriers to entry and costume to promote teamwork  collaboration and to lower social anxieties. These techniques  in partnership with the digital-physical nature of the game play aims to entice players and spectators in a social environment to participate. Through this installation we hope to encourage discussion around designing for participation and the challenges of social play.

Cormier  University of Waterloo Christian Hansen  Otto-von-Guericke Universität Edward Lank  University of Waterloo Lennart E. Nacke  University of Waterloo,We introduceCrushed It!  an interactive game on a sensor floor. This floor is combined with a multiple projector system to reduce occlusions from players' interactions with the floor. Individual displays  an HTC Vive to track player position  and smart watches were added to provide an extra layer of interactivity. We created this interactive experience to explore collaboration between people when interacting with large displays. We contribute a novel combination of different technologies for this game system and our studies showed this game is both entertaining and provides players with motivation to stay physically active. We believe presenting at interactivity would be a benefit to both our research and to the attendees of CHI 2019.
374,INT015: FoldTronics Demo: Creating 3D Objects with Integrated Electronics Using Foldable Honeycomb Structures,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Junichi Yamaoka  Massachusetts Institute of Technology & University of Tokyo Mustafa Doga Dogan  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Katarina Bulovic  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Kazuya Saito  University of Tokyo Yoshihiro Kawahara  University of Tokyo Yasuaki Kakehi  University of Tokyo Stefanie Mueller  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,We present FoldTronics  a 2D-cutting based fabrication technique to integrate electronics into 3D folded objects. The key idea is to cut and perforate a 2D sheet using a cutting plotter to make it foldable into a 3D honeycomb structure; before folding  users place the electronic components and circuitry onto the sheet. The fabrication process only takes a few minutes allowing to rapidly prototype functional interactive devices. The resulting objects are lightweight and rigid  thus allowing for weight-sensitive and force-sensitive applications. Due to the nature of honeycombs  the created objects can be folded flat along one axis and thus can be efficiently transported in this compact form factor.
375,INT016: Demonstrating Kyub: A 3D Editor for Modeling Sturdy Laser-Cut Objects,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Patrick Baudisch  Hasso Plattner Institute Arthur Silber  Hasso Plattner Institute Yannis Kommana  Hasso Plattner Institute Milan Gruner  Hasso Plattner Institute Ludwig Wall  Hasso Plattner Institute Kevin Reuss  Hasso Plattner Institute Lukas Heilmann  Hasso-Plattner-Institut Robert Kovacs  Hasso Plattner Institute Daniel Rechlitz  Hasso Plattner Institute Thijs Roumen  Hasso Plattner Institute,"We present an interactive editing system for laser cutting called kyub. Kyub allows users to create models efficiently in 3D  which it then unfolds into the 2D plates laser cutters expect. Unlike earlier systems  such as FlatFitFab  kyub affords construction based on closed box structures  which allows users to turn very thin material  such as 4mm plywood  into objects capable of withstanding large forces  such as chairs users can actually sit on. To afford such sturdy construction  every kyub project begins with a simple finger-joint ""boxel""—a structure we found to be capable of withstanding over 500kg of load. Users then extend their model by attaching additional boxels. Boxels merge automatically  resulting in larger  yet equally strong structures. While the concept of stacking boxels allows kyub to offer the strong affordance and ease of use of a voxel-based editor  boxels are not confined to a grid and readily combine with kuyb's various geometry deformation tools. In our technical evaluation  objects built with kyub withstood hundreds of kilograms of loads. We demonstrate the kyub software to the CHI audience and allow them to experience the resulting models first hand."

Much of this research focuses on elastomers or non-stretchy air bladders. In this work  we explore a series of design strategies for machine knitting actuated soft objects by integrating tendons with shaping and anisotropic texture design.
377,INT018: Painting with CATS: Camera-Aided Texture Synthesis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Ticha Sethapakdi  Carnegie Mellon University James McCann  Carnegie Mellon University,We present CATS  a digital painting system that synthesizes textures from live video in real-time  short-cutting the typical brush- and texture- gathering workflow. Through the use of boundary-aware texture synthesis  CATS produces strokes that are non-repeating and blend smoothly with each other. This allows CATS to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. We evaluated the effectiveness of CATS by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that CATS is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings.
378,INT019: Flowboard: A Visual Flow-Based Programming Environment for Embedded Coding,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Anke Brocker  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Tony Zelun Zhang  RWTH Aachen University Mathis Müller  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,With Maker-friendly environments like the Arduino IDE  embedded programming has become an important part of STEM education. But learning embedded programming is still hard  requiring both coding and basic electronics skills. To understand if a different programming paradigm can help  we developed Flowboard  which uses Flow-Based Programming (FBP) rather than the usual imperative programming paradigm. Instead of command sequences  learners assemble processing nodes into a graph through which signals and data flow. Flowboard consists of a visual flow-based editor on an iPad  a hardware frame integrating the iPad  an Arduino board and two breadboards next to the iPad  letting learners connect their visual graphs seamlessly to the input and output electronics. Graph edits take effect immediately  making Flowboard a live coding environment.
379,INT020: Live Programming By Example,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Mark Santolucito  Yale University William T. Hallahan  Yale University Ruzica Piskac  Yale University,Live programming is a novel approach for programming practice. Programmers are given real-time feedback when writing code  traditionally via a graphical user interface. Despite live programming's practical values  such as providing an easier overview of code and better understanding of its structure  it is not yet widely used. In this work  we extend live programming to general purpose code editors  which allows for live programming to be used by programmers  and provides new interfaces for understanding and changing the functionality of code. To achieve this we extended a fully-featured IDE with the ability to show input/output examples of code execution  as the programmer is writing code. Furthermore  we integrate programming by example (PBE) synthesis into our tool by allowing the user to change the shown output  and have the code update automatically. Our goal is to use live programming to give novice programmers a new way to interact and understand programming  as well as being a useful development tool for more advanced programmers.
380,INT021: Dynamic Depth-of-Field Projection for 3D Projection Mapping,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Lihui Wang  University of Tokyo Hongjin Xu  University of Tokyo Yunpu Hu  University of Tokyo Satoshi Tabata  University of Tokyo Masatoshi Ishikawa  University of Tokyo,Demonstration for a dynamic depth-of-field projection mapping on a 3D moving object would be performed. Conventional projection mapping was limited on 2D space  due to their narrow depth-of-field projection range. Our system included a high-speed projector  a high-speed variable focus lens  a depth sensor by a stereo camera  so that the depth information would be detected and then served as feedback to correct the focal length of the projection. As a result  a projection mapping would be well-focused projected on a 3D dynamic moving object.
381,INT022: Demonstration of Springlets: Expressive  Flexible and Silent On-Skin Tactile Interfaces,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Nur Al-huda Hamdan  RWTH Aachen University Adrian Wagner  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University Jürgen Steimle  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus,We present Springlets  expressive  non-vibrating mechanotactile interfaces on the skin. Embedded with shape memory alloy springs  we implement Springlets as thin and flexible stickers to be worn on various body locations  thanks to their silent operation even on the neck and head. We present a technically simple and rapid technique for fabricating a wide range of Springlet interfaces. We developed six modular Springlets: a pincher  a directional stretcher  a presser  a puller  a dragger  and an expander (Fig. 1). In our hands-on demonstration  we show our modular Springlets and several Springlet interfaces for tactile social communication  physical guidance  health interfaces  navigation  and virtual reality gaming. Attendees can wear the interfaces and explore their expressive variable force profiles and spatiotemporal patterns.
382,INT023: A Sensing Technique for Data Glove Using Conductive Fiber,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Ryosuke Takada  University of Tsukuba Junichiro Kadomoto  The Univesity of Tokyo Buntarou Shizuki  University of Tsukuba,We demonstrate a sensing technique for data gloves using conductive fiber. This technique enables us to estimate hand shapes (bend of a finger and contact between fingers) and differentiates a grabbing tag. To estimate how far each finger bends  the electrical resistance of the conductive fiber is measured; this resistance decreases as the finger bends because the surface of the glove short circuits. To detect contact between fingers  we apply alternating currents with different frequencies to each finger and measure the signal propagation between the fingers. This principle is also used to differentiate a grabbing tag (each tag has an alternating current with a unique frequency). We developed a prototype data glove based on this technique.

This interactive artwork is experienced through the HTC Vive headset  with movement and touch key elements to the aesthetic of this work. It combines both a physical and a digital sculpture and in doing so creates a mixed reality that plays on a disconnect between what we can see and what we can feel.
387,INT028: Hypercept: Speculating the Visual World Intervened by Digital Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jiabao Li  Harvard Graduate School of Design Honghao Deng  Harvard Graduate School of Design Panagiotis Michalatos  Harvard Graduate School of Design,Human perception has long been influenced by technological breakthroughs. An intimate mediation of technology lies in between our direct perceptions and the environment we perceive. Through three extreme ideal types of perceptual machines  this project defamiliarizes and questions the habitual ways in which we interpret  operate  and understand the visual world intervened by digital media. The three machines create: Hyper-sensitive vision – a speculation on social media's amplification effect and our filtered communication landscape. Hyper-focused vision – an analogue version of the searching behavior on the Internet. Hyper-commoditized vision – monetized vision that meditates on the omnipresent advertisement targeted all over our visual field. The site of intervention is the visual field in a technologically augmented society. All the three machines have both internal state and external signal.

389,INT030: Come Hither to Me: Performance of a Seductive Robot,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Sahar Sajadieh  University of California  Santa Barbara Hannah Wolfe  University of California  Santa Barbara,Come Hither to Me is an interactive robotic performance  which examines the emotive social interaction between an audience and a robot. Our interactive robot attempts to communicate and flirt with audience members in the gallery. The robot uses feedback from sensors  auditory data  and computer vision techniques to learn about the participants and inform its conversation. The female robot approaches the audience  picks her favorites  and starts charming them with seductive comments  funny remarks  backhanded compliments  and personal questions. We are interested in evoking emotions in the participating audience through their interactions with the robot. Come Hither to Me strives to invert gender roles and stereotypical expectations in flirtatious interactions. This performative piece explores the dynamics of social communication  objectification of women  and the gamification of seduction. The robot reduces flirtation to an algorithm  codifying pick-up lines and sexting paradigms.

392,INT033: Death Ground,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Christos Michalakos  Abertay University Bernt Isak Wærstad  Norwegian University of Science and Technology,Death Ground is a competitive musical installation-game for two players. The work is designed to provide the framework for the players/participants in which to perform game-mediated musical gestures against each-other. The main mechanic involves destroying the other player's avatar by outmaneuvering and using audio weapons and improvised musical actions against it. These weapons are spawned in an enclosed area during the performance and can be used by whoever is collects them first. There is a multitude of such power-ups  all of which have different properties  such as speed boost  additional damage  ground traps and so on. All of these weapons affect the sound and sonic textures that each of the avatars produce. Additionally  the players can use elements of the environment such as platforms  obstructions and elevation in order to gain competitive advantage  or position themselves strategically to access first the spawned power-ups.
393,INT034: Keycube is a Kind of Keyboard (k^(3)),Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Damien Brun  Université TÉLUQ Charles Gouin-Vallerand  Université TÉLUQ Sébastien George  Le Mans Université,Alternate realities through headsets  such as augmented  mixed and virtual reality are becoming part of people's everyday life. Except in some limited context  usual keyboards are inappropriate for such technological medium and alternative interfaces for text-entry must be explored. In this paper we present the keycube  a general-purpose cubic handheld device that goes beyond the text-entry interface by including multiple keys  a touch-screen  an inertial unit with six degrees-of-freedom and a vibrotactile feedback. Strong of its form factor and affordance  the keycube offers advantages with regards to mobility  comfort  learnability  privacy and playfulness. Thus  the combination creates a novel text-entry interface convenient for many use cases across the whole reality-virtuality continuum.

402,INT044: Multisensory Virtual Environment for Fire Evacuation Training,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tommy Nilsson  University of Nottingham Tessa Roper  University of Nottingham Emily Shaw  University of Nottingham Glyn Lawson  University of Nottingham Sue V. G. Cobb  University of Nottingham Hsieh Meng-Ko  University of Nottingham Daniel Miller  University of Nottingham James Khan  University of Nottingham,Growing organizational safety awareness is propelling the interest in development of novel solutions for fire training. Significant effort in this area has previously gone into designing various immersive virtual reality (VR) systems in hopes of enabling safe exploration and experiencing the consequences of ones actions in scenarios that would be too hazardous in the real life. Yet  the fact that VR generally lacks the sensory feedback of a real life fire situation has been found to impede a sense of realism and validity of such experiences. As part of our efforts to mitigate this issue  we now present a new prototype fire evacuation simulator designed to deliver not just audiovisual feedback  but likewise real-time heat and scent stimulation.
403,INT045: 3D Positional Movement Interaction with User-Defined  Virtual Interface for Music Software: MoveMIDI,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Timothy Arterbury  Baylor University G. Michael Poor  Baylor University,This paper describes progress made in design and development of a new digital musical instrument (MIDI controller)  MoveMIDI  and highlights its unique 3D positional movement interaction design differing from recent orientational and gestural approaches. A user constructs and interacts with MoveMIDI's virtual  3D interface using handheld position-tracked controllers to control music software  as well as non-musical technology such as stage lighting. MoveMIDI's virtual interface contributes to solving problems difficult to solve with hardware MIDI controller interfaces such as customized positioning and instantiation of interface elements  and accurate  simultaneous control of independent parameters. MoveMIDI's positional interaction mirrors interaction with some physical acoustic instruments and provides visualization for an audience. Beta testers of MoveMIDI have created emergent use cases for the instrument.
404,INT046: Are Drones Meditative?,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Joseph La Delfa  RMIT University Mehmet Aydin Baytas  Qualisys AB Olivia Wichtowski  RMIT University Rohit Ashok Khot  RMIT University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University,Meditative movement involves regulating attention to the body whilst moving  to create a state of meditation. This can be difficult for beginners  we propose that drones can facilitate this as they can move with and give feedback to whole body movements. We present a demonstration that explores various ways drones could facilitate meditative movement by drawing attention to the body. We designed a two-handed control map for the drone that engages multiple parts of the body  a light foam casing to give the impression that the drone is floating and an onboard light which gives feedback to the speed of the movement. The user will experience both leading and following the drone to explore the interplay between mapping  form  feedback and instruction. The demonstration relates to an expansion of the attention regulation framework  which is used to inform the design of interactive meditative experiences and human-drone interactions.

407,INT049: Movie+: Towards Exploring Social Effects of Emotional Fingerprints for Video Clips and Movies,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Anton Fedosov  Università della Svizzera italiana Bianca Stancu  Università della Svizzera italiana Elena Di Lascio  Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) Davide Eynard  Università della Svizzera italiana Marc Langheinrich  Faculty of Computer Science,"Collaborative movie viewing with the loved ones increases connectedness and social bonds within family members and friends. Furthermore  with the rapid adoption of personal mobile devices  people often engage in this activity being geographically separated. However  conveying our feelings and emotions about a recently watched movie or a video clip is often limited to a post on social media or a short blurb on an instant messaging app. Drawing on the popular interest in quantified-self  which envisioned one collecting and sharing biophysical information from everyday routines (e.g.  workouts)  we have designed and developed Movie+  a mobile application  which utilizes personal biophysical data to construct an individual's ""emotional fingerprint"" while viewing a video clip. Movie+ allows the selective sharing of this information through different visualization options  as well as rendering others' emotional fingerprints over the same clip. In this submission  we outline the design rationale and briefly describe our application prototype."
408,INT050: PhotoFlow in Action: Picture-Mediated Reminiscence Supporting Family Socio-Connectivity,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Benett Axtell  University of Toronto Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto & University of Toronto Mississauga,Family connections are maintained through sharing reminiscences  often supported by family photographs which easily prompt memories. This is increasingly important as we age  as picture-based reminiscence has been shown to reduce older adults' social isolation. However  there is a gap between sharing memories from physical pictures and the limited support for oral social reminiscence afforded by digital tools. PhotoFlow supports older adults' picture-mediated social storytelling of family memories using an intuitive metaphor mirroring sharing physical family pictures on a table top. The app uses the speech of oral storytelling to automatically organize pictures based only on what has been said. This simplifies the overall process of family picture interactions by leveraging one enjoyable aspect to ease a more effortful one. In particular  the familiar table top interaction metaphor has the potential to bridge the gap between physical picture reminiscence and managing digital picture collections.
409,Empowering Expression for Users with Aphasia through Constrained Creativity,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Timothy Neate  City  University of London Abi Roper  City  University of London Stephanie Wilson  City  University of London Jane Marshall  City  University of London,Creative activities allow people to express themselves in rich  nuanced ways. However  being creative does not always come easily. For example  people with speech and language impairments  such as aphasia  face challenges in creative activities that involve language. In this paper  we explore the concept of constrained creativity as a way of addressing this challenge and enabling creative writing. We report an app  MakeWrite  that supports the constrained creation of digital texts through automated redaction. The app was co-designed with and for people with aphasia and was subsequently explored in a workshop with a group of people with aphasia. Participants were not only successful in crafting novel language  but  importantly  self-reported that the app was crucial in enabling them to do so. We refect on the potential of technology-supported constrained creativity as a means of empowering expression amongst users with diverse needs.
410,LBW2810: Minimalistic Explanations: Capturing the Essence of Decisions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Martin Schuessler  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut Philipp Weiß  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut,The use of complex machine learning models can make systems opaque to users. Machine learning research proposes the use of post-hoc explanations. However  it is unclear if they give users insights into otherwise uninterpretable models. One minimalistic way of explaining image classifications by a deep neural network is to show only the areas that were decisive for the assignment of a label. In a pilot study  20 participants looked at 14 of such explanations generated either by a human or the LIME algorithm. For explanations of correct decisions  they identified the explained object with significantly higher accuracy (75.64 % vs. 18.52 %). We argue that this shows that explanations can be very minimalistic while retaining the essence of a decision  but the decision-making contexts that can be conveyed in this manner is limited. Finally  we found that explanations are unique to the explainer and human-generated explanations were assigned 79 % higher trust ratings. As a starting point for further studies  this work shares our first insights into quality criteria of post-hoc explanations.
411,LBW2511: Supporting Data Workers To Perform Exploratory Programming,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Krishna Subramanian  RWTH Aachen University Ilya Zubarev  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,Data science is an open-ended task in whichexploratory programming is a common practice. Data workers often need faster and easier ways to explore alternative approaches to obtain insights from data  which frequently compromises code quality. To understand how well current IDEs support this exploratory workflow  we conducted an observational study with 19 data workers. In this paper  we present two significant findings from our analysis that highlight issues faced by data workers: (a)code hoarding and (b) excessivetask switching andcode cloning. To mitigate these issues  we provide design recommendations based on existing work  and propose to augment IDEs with an interactive visual plugin. This plugin parses source code to identify and visualize high-level task details. Data workers can use the resulting visualization to better understand and navigate the source code. As a realization of this idea  we presentAddIn  an add-in for RStudio that identifies and visualizes the hypotheses that a data worker is testing for statistical significance through her source code.
412,Voice-Based Quizzes for Measuring Knowledge Retention in Under-Connected Populations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Agha Ali Raza  Information Technology University Zain Tariq  Information Technology University Shan Randhawa  Information Technology University Bilal Saleem  Information Technology University Awais Athar  European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) Umar Saif  Information Technology University Roni Rosenfeld  Carnegie Mellon University,Information dissemination using automated phone calls allows reaching low-literate and tech-naive populations. Open challenges include rapid verification of expected knowledge gaps in the community  dissemination of specific information to address these gaps  and follow-up measurement of knowledge retention. We report Sawaal  a voice-based telephone service that uses audio-quizzes to address these challenges. Sawaal allows its open community of users to post and attempt multiple-choice questions and to vote and comment on them. Sawaal spreads virally as users challenge friends to quiz competitions. Administrator-posted questions allow confirming specific knowledge gaps  spreading correct information and measuring knowledge retention via rephrased  repeated questions. In 14 weeks and with no advertisement  Sawaal reached 3 433 users (120 119 calls) in Pakistan  who contributed 13 276 questions that were attempted 455 158 times by 2 027 users. Knowledge retention remained significant for up to two weeks. Surveys revealed that 71% of the mostly low-literate  young  male users were blind.

Walter Lee  University of Minnesota,Augmenting grassroots community policing (CP) efforts with technologies that assist citizens is a promising strategy for reducing real and perceived fear of crime. We used a human-centered design approach  working with residents of the St. Paul Summit-University neighborhood  to discern abstract functionalities for developing new CP technology. We then created and evaluated NeighBoard (Figure 1)  which aims to enhance the social fabric of communities by letting citizens implement their own strategies for preventing crime and maintaining safety in their neighborhood.

Joseph  National Institute of Design Lamha Bijili  National Institute of Design Md. Aasif Anwar  National Institute of Design Urvi  National Institute of Design,The current Indian education system promotes competition among students  emphasizing highly on ranks and marks scored. As a consequence  students tend to drift away from a collaborative mindset to a competitive one. The learning gap is even larger in schools catering to lower income groups due to the absence of digital infrastructure and digital knowledge. As a result  a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge  the internet  causing the gap to increase between students in the society. With co ed  we attempt to bridge these gaps by providing a platform to foster mutual learning as well as combining digital mediums and the long-established pen and paper in a seamless manner.
415,SDC03: Drawxi: An Accessible Drawing Tool for Collaboration,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Suraj Chiplunkar  Indiana University Anany Maini  Indiana University Dinesh Ram  Indiana University Zixuan Zheng  Indiana University Yaxin Zheng  Indiana University Bloomington,Visual impairment can profoundly impact well-being and social advancement. Current solutions for accessing graphical information fail to provide an affordable  user-friendly collaborative platform for visually impaired and sighted people to work together. Therefore  sighted users tend to have low expectations from visually impaired people while working in a team. Hence  visually impaired people feel discouraged to participate in a mixed population collaborative environment. Consequently  their generative capabilities remain devalued. In this paper  we propose an audio-haptic enabled tool (Drawxi) for free-form sketching and sharing simple diagrams (processes  workflows  ideas  perspectives  etc.). It provides a common platform for visually-impaired and sighted people to work together by communicating each other's ideas visually. Thus  enabling the discovery of generative capabilities in a hands-on way. We relied upon participatory research methods (Contextual inquiry  Co-Design) involving visually impaired participants throughout the design process. We evaluated our proposed design through usability testing which revealed that collaboration between visually impaired and sighted people benefits from the use of common tools and platforms. Thereby  enhancing the degree of their participation in a collaborative environment and quality of co-creation activities.

While people are constantly suffering from body shape anxiety  they do not realize that beauty standard is not an absolute truth and that it is changing and depends on time and space. To help people free from the constraint imposed by social beauty standards and connect those who have concerns over their body shape  we devised a technological solution named ""Shadoji""  which can bring people a new perspective on their body shapes  give them a chance to create their unique body shape emoji  and to explore diverse body shapes from users around the world."
417,SDC05: Give Me a Break: Design for Communication Among Family Caregivers and Respite Caregivers,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Flannery Currin  Earlham College Gustavo Razo  University of California  Merced Aehong Min  Indiana University Bloomington,This study focuses on solutions to issues that arise from gaps in communication between primary family caregivers of older adults and respite caregivers. We collected data through 18 semi-structured interviews with primary family and respite caregivers and qualitatively analyzed the interviews to extract common needs. Participants identified three main needs that our designs address: building trust through status updates  learning routines & care management  and accessing technology. Based on those needs  we designed a prototype of an application which connects primary family caregivers with respite caregivers and facilitates communication between the involved parties. This design can serve as a framework for future work designed to improve elder care in general  the well-being of caregivers  and the effectiveness of respite care.

Sharing feelings  emotions  thoughts  activities  and even finances enables couples to spend quality time with each other. In particular  financial management plays an important role in relationship quality of emerging adult couples. We present Amor  a mobile application that bridges emerging adult couples closely to pool and spend their money together for a common goal. Amor also allows the couples to explore activities that harmonize with their characteristics as well as an encouragement for the two to achieve their desired goals.
419,SDC07: SENTI? Reconnect with Yourself to Better Connect with Others,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Audrey Drolet  Université Laval Thomas Lemonde-Marzell  Université Laval Pablo Matos Da Silva  Université Laval Kim Lamontagne  Université Laval Marjorie Bédard  Université Laval,Occidental societies are becoming increasingly demanding. Citizens often feel overwhelmed and feel the need to rest  which they do so by isolating themselves from others. Individuals who use this time alone to reflect on their situation find that this reflection helps create deeper connections with others afterwards. With this in mind  we developed Senti?  a solution that aims to encourage people to take time for themselves in hopes that it will lead them to be more open-minded when interacting with others. The solution helps people focus on bodily sensations and generates a comfortable and effortless time for introspection. Senti? uses the subconscious benefits of perceiving one's heartbeat to foster personal reflection.
420,SDC08: Haptic Remembrance Book Series,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Elaine Czech  Keio University Mina Shibasaki  Keio University Keitaro Tsuchiya  Keio University,While having strong social networks is essential for good quality of life  socializing gets more difficult as we age even if we are surrounded by people in a nursing home setting. Care staff and family members want to be able to connect with residents/loved ones but have limitations (time constraints  unsure how)  and it can be challenging to feel a connection to another resident who has differing abilities. We propose that through sharing strong positive memories  members of a nursing home community (residents  care staff  and families) will be able to build empathy for one another and thus strengthen their community bonds. By applying multi-modal technologies to a familiar medium  the book  we provided a means by which intergenerational users  from various backgrounds  could interact with and gain meaning from the content.
421,SDC09: HelloBox: Creating Safer and Kid-friendly Communities,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tab Zhang  University of Minnesota Yongle Zhang  University of Minnesota Leyi Sun  University of Minnesota Lily Dunk  University of Minnesota,Children's ability to walk to school or play around their neighborhoods without parental supervision has severely declined in the past decade. Loss of local activities and mobility may leave children prepared for transitions to adulthood and make them less independent and may have negative health effects. In this paper  we discuss the findings of our research on children's unsupervised play in their neighborhoods. We propose HelloBox  a system including an app  wearable RFID tags  and check-in stations to keep track of children when they are outside without an adult. HelloBox lets parents know where their children are without restricting their independence and builds community between local families. The project focuses on improving children's independent mobility and encouraging social interactions between families within neighborhoods.
422,SDC10: HearU: An Integrated System to Raise Awareness of Hearing Loss,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Beijia Wang  University of Washington Mengxiao Song  University of Washington Yuting Han  University of Washington Duo Wang  University of Washington,Hearing loss is a prevalent public health crisis that often goes unnoticed in public eye due to its invisibility. People who are hard of hearing (HH) often experience social isolation caused by the lack of understanding from the hearing community. Our research revealed that there is a communication gap between the hearing and HH communities. The current state of art tends to focus on assisting HH people to participate in conversations  which places more responsibility on the HH community. There is a lack of responsibility of people in the hearing community. However  communication works in two directions; it requires both parties to take responsibility. In this paper  we present HearU - an integrated  multichannel system that includes public interaction. Through the creation of an immersive experience that increases people's awareness of hearing loss  we aim to use HearU as a medium to weave these two communities together as a whole.
423,SDC11: PALS: Patching ALS through Crowdsourced Advice  Social Links & Public Awareness,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Richard Cave  University College London Karina Kocemba  University College London Svjetlana Dajic  University College London Holloe Bostock  University College London Alastair Cook  University College London,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a serious and poorly understood disease  impacting 50 000 people a year globally. Our research found that people with ALS express a lack of connection with other people with the disease  and that the general public lacks awareness about ALS. We also identified an engagement problem with the currently available resources to connect and support people with ALS. To address these issues  we introduce 'PALS' - an accessible crowdsourcing and connection quilt  first hung like a tapestry in the ALS clinic  then later used as an interactive public display. The quilt offers the opportunity to access crowdsourced information concerning individual experiences of ALS. Our work offers three primary contributions: 1) adding to limited HCI research concerning the ALS community by establishing the needs  2) applying the 'PALS' quilt design solution to these needs  and 3) combining three modalities: crowdsourcing  tangible tapestry displays  and interactive waiting education in a unique way.
424,SDC12: TechBuddies: Engaging Students to Teach Retirees about Technology,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jim Philippe Neussl  University College London Rebecca Zheng  University College London George Hanson  University College London Boyin Yang  University College London,Retirees suffer from impaired mobility  loss of friends and family  and loneliness. Although these problems could be mitigated through the use of digital communication devices and the internet  many retirees lack the skill and confidence to use them effectively. The existing community initiatives that aim to help retirees understand technology often lack volunteers to teach them. This is why we developed TechBuddies  a two-component system aimed at engaging more students as volunteers. The first component consists of an interactive display that raises awareness about volunteering opportunities by simulating an interaction between a retiree and the potential volunteer. The second component involves an app-based platform that facilitates communication about events and encourages long-term engagement. TechBuddies raises awareness about and provides a platform for inter-generational interactions between students and retirees who are a part of the same local community.

Making Well-being: Exploring the Role of Makerspaces in Long Term Care Facilities,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Kayla Carucci  University of Michigan Kentaro Toyama  University of Michigan,Fourth-age residents in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are known to suffer declines in well-being due to their advanced age and resulting loss of independence. Using an action research approach  we set up a makerspace in a New Jersey LTCF for eight weeks to see whether it could improve well-being for residents. Based on engaged observation over 280 hours and semi-structured interviews with participants  we find that people aged 80-99 years will spend (sometimes significant) time in a makerspace for the purposes of making and companionship; that makerspaces can contribute to both autonomy and well-being for older residents; and participants produced not only decorative art  but novel artifacts that solved real challenges in their daily lives. We situate these findings in the literature on art and activity therapy for fourth-age people  and make recommendations for makerspaces in long-term care facilities.
Making Sense of Art: Access for Gallery Visitors with Vision Impairments,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Leona Holloway  Monash University Kim Marriott  Monash University Matthew Butler  Monash University Alan Borning  University of Washington,While there is widespread recognition of the need to provide people with vision impairments (PVI) equitable access to cultural institutions such as art galleries  this is not easy. We present the results of a collaboration with a regional art gallery who wished to open their collection to PVIs in the local community. We describe a novel model that provides three different ways of accessing the gallery  depending upon visual acuity and mobility: virtual tours  self-guided tours and guided tours. As far as possible the model supports autonomous exploration by PVIs. It was informed by a value sensitive design exploration of the values and value conflicts of the primary stakeholders.
A Place to Play: The (Dis)Abled Embodied Experience for Autistic Children in Online Spaces,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Kathryn E. Ringland  Northwestern University,Play is the work of children—but access to play is not equal from child to child. Having access to a place to play is a challenge for marginalized children  such as children with disabilities. For autistic children  playing with other children in the physical world may be uncomfortable or even painful. Yet  having practice in the social skills play provides is essential for childhood development. In this ethnographic work  I explore how one community uses the sense of place and the digital embodied experience in a virtual world specifically to give autistic children access to play with their peers. The contribution of this work is twofold. First  I demonstrate how various physical and virtual spaces work together to make play possible. Second  I demonstrate these spaces  though some of them are digital  are no more or less "real" than the physical spaces making up a schoolyard or playground.
"Occupational Therapy is Making": Clinical Rapid Prototyping and Digital Fabrication,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Megan Hofmann  Carnegie Mellon University Kristin Williams  Carnegie Mellon University Toni Kaplan  Carnegie Mellon University Stephanie Valencia  Carnegie Mellon University Gabriella Hann  Carnegie Mellon University Scott Hudson  Carnegie Mellon University Jennifer Mankoff  University of Washington Patrick Carrington  Carnegie Mellon University,Consumer-fabrication technologies potentially improve the effectiveness and adoption of assistive technology (AT) by engaging AT users in AT creation. However  little is known about the role of clinicians in this revolution. We investigate clinical AT fabrication by working as expert fabricators for clinicians over a four-month period. We observed and co-designed AT with four occupational therapists at two clinics: a free clinic for uninsured clients  and a Veteran's Affairs Hospital. We find that existing fabrication processes  particularly with respect to rapid prototyping  do not align with clinical practice and its \textit{do-no-harm} ethos. We recommend software solutions that would integrate into client care by: amplifying clinicians' expertise  revealing appropriate fabrication opportunities  and supporting adaptable fabrication.
Machine Heuristic: When We Trust Computers More than Humans with Our Personal Information,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,S. Shyam Sundar  Pennsylvania State University Jinyoung Kim  Pennsylvania State University,In this day and age of identity theft  are we likely to trust machines more than humans for handling our personal information? We answer this question by invoking the concept of "machine heuristic " which is a rule of thumb that machines are more secure and trustworthy than humans. In an experiment (N = 160) that involved making airline reservations  users were more likely to reveal their credit card information to a machine agent than a human agent. We demonstrate that cues on the interface trigger the machine heuristic by showing that those with higher cognitive accessibility of the heuristic (i.e.  stronger prior belief in the rule of thumb) were more likely than those with lower accessibility to disclose to a machine  but they did not differ in their disclosure to a human. These findings have implications for design of interface cues conveying machine vs. human sources of our online interactions.
AI-Mediated Communication: How the Perception that Profile Text was Written by AI Affects Trustworthiness,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Maurice Jakesch  Cornell Tech Megan French  Stanford University Xiao Ma  Cornell Tech Jeffrey T. Hancock  Stanford University Mor Naaman  Cornell Tech,We are entering an era of AI-Mediated Communication (AI-MC) where interpersonal communication is not only mediated by technology  but is optimized  augmented  or generated by artificial intelligence. Our study takes a first look at the potential impact of AI-MC on online self-presentation. In three experiments we test whether people find Airbnb hosts less trustworthy if they believe their profiles have been written by AI. We observe a new phenomenon that we term the Replicant Effect: Only when participants thought they saw a mixed set of AI- and human-written profiles  they mistrusted hosts whose profiles were labeled as or suspected to be written by AI. Our findings have implications for the design of systems that involve AI technologies in online self-presentation and chart a direction for future work that may upend or augment key aspects of Computer-Mediated Communication theory.
Automation Accuracy Is Good  but High Controllability May Be Better,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Quentin Roy  University of Waterloo Futian Zhang  University of Waterloo Daniel Vogel  University of Waterloo,When automating tasks using some form of artificial intelligence  some inaccuracy in the result is virtually unavoidable. In many cases  the user must decide whether to try the automated method again  or fix it themselves using the available user interface. We argue this decision is influenced by both perceived automation accuracy and degree of task "controllability" (how easily and to what extent an automated result can be manually modified). This relationship between accuracy and controllability is investigated in a 750-participant crowdsourced experiment using a controlled  gamified task. With high controllability  self-reported satisfaction remained constant even under very low accuracy conditions  and overall  a strong preference was observed for using manual control rather than automation  despite much slower performance and regardless of very poor controllability.
Upside and Downside Risk in Online Security for Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Helena M. Mentis  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Galina Madjaroff  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Aaron K. Massey  University of Maryland  Baltimore County,Older adults are rapidly increasing their use of online services such as banking  social media  and email - services that come with subtle and serious security and privacy risks. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are particularly vulnerable to these risks because MCI can reduce their ability to recognize scams such as email phishing  follow recommended password guidelines  and consider the implications of sharing personal information. Older adults with MCI often cope with their impairments with the help of caregivers  including partners  children  and professional health personnel  when using and managing online services. Yet  this too carries security and privacy risks: sharing personal information with caregivers can create issues of agency  autonomy  and even risk embarrassment and information leakage; caregivers also do not always act in their charges' best interest. Through a series of interviews conducted in the US  we identify a spectrum of safeguarding strategies used and consider them through the lens of 'upside and downside risk' where there are tradeoffs between reduced privacy and maintaining older adults' autonomy and access to online services.
SENSEI: Harnessing Community Wisdom for Local Environmental Monitoring in Finland,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Victoria Palacin  LUT University Síle Ginnane  Liberty Bell Maria Angela Ferrario  Lancaster University Ari Happonen  LUT University Annika Wolff  LUT University Sara Piutunen  Lappeenranta Environmental Office Niina Kupiainen  ME-talo,The way people participate in decision making has radically changed over the last few decades. Technology has facilitated the sharing of knowledge  ideas and opinions across social structures and  has allowed grass-root initiatives to flourish. Participatory civic technology has helped local communities to embrace civic action on matters of shared concern. In this case study  we describe SENSEI  a year-long participatory sensing movement. Local community organisations  decision makers  families  individuals and researchers worked together to co-create civic technologies to help them address environmental issues of shared interest  such as invasive plant species  abandoned items in the forests and nice places. Over 240 local participants have taken part to the different stages of this year long process which included ten community events and workshops. As a result  over hundred concrete ideas about issues of common interest were generated  nearly thirty civic tech prototypes were designed and developed  along hundreds of environmental observations. In this paper  we describe the process or orchestration of this initiative and present key reflections from it.
Designing Airport Interiors with 3D Visualizations,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Genovefa Kefalidou  University of Leicester Mirabelle D'Cruz  University of Nottingham Andre Castro  Alma Design Rui Marcelino  Alma Design,Understandings of user-centered design incorporate the need to include users and stakeholders in the design process from early on  employing visual and 'enactment' principles and approaches. Virtual Reality (VR) and 3D visualizations offer such opportunities for enhanced 'enactments' of proposed designs through immersion. Within PASSME H2020 European project  3D design visualizations for novel concepts for an airport interior were developed and tested early on with users to identify the best interior design principles among the alternatives considered to reduce passenger stress  waiting times and improve overall Passenger Experience (PAX). Using the potential of VR  concepts were tested with users and we identified passenger emotional and design-driven responses to boarding gates and lounge visualizations to inform the iterative development of in-situ passenger-centric interventions. We elicited both emotional  practical and operational needs and requirements for improving PAX within airports and found out that users can use VR to imagine interaction scenarios within the proposed design products.
Towards Novel Urban Planning Methods -- Using Eye-tracking Systems to Understand Human Attention in Urban Environments,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Teija Vainio  University of Tampere Ilari Karppi  University of Tampere Ari Jokinen  University of Tampere Helena Leino  University of Tampere,Data on how humans perceive the attractiveness of their (urban) environments has been mainly gathered with qualitative methods  including workshops  interviews and group discussions. Qualitative methods help us to understand the phenomenon  albeit with the cost of sufficient information as concerns its details. We may end up confirming something that we as researchers have 'programmed' to get as a result. Here we take a complementary approach  having collected eye tracking data from two case experiments. The participants to these experiments were professional urban planners and non-professionals respectively. We asked them to view planning-related artefacts comprising architectural illustrations  photographed landscapes and planning sketches. After analysing the findings from these experiments  we draw guidelines for using the eye tracking system in urban planning processes for gathering the human perceptions of attractive urban environments
Factitious: Large Scale Computer Game to Fight Fake News and Improve News Literacy,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Lindsay Grace  University of Miami Bob Hone  American University,This case study describes a game designed to serve as new literacy education tool  playful polling system for research audience perceptions. The game underwent two primary designer iterations. As a result of design changes and renewed political chatter about fake news  the game's second iteration gathered more than 500 000 plays. The data collected reveals useful patterns in understanding news literacy and the perception of play experiences. This data of more than 45 000 players  indicates that the older the person the better they are at identifying fake news  until the approximate age of 70. It also indicates that higher education correlates to better performance at identifying real news from fake  although the time it takes to do so varies. This case study demonstrates the potential for such game designs to collect data useful to non-game contexts.
Insights in Experimental Data through Intuitive and Interactive Statistics,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Jean-Bernard Martens  Eindhoven University of Technology,It is not unusual for empirical scientists  who are often not specialists in statistics  to have only limited trust in the statistical analyses that they apply to their data. The claim of this course is that an improved human-computer interaction with statistical methods can be accomplished by providing a simple mental model of what statistics does  and to support this model through well-chosen visualizations and interactive exploration. In order to support this proposed approach  an entirely new program for performing interactive statistics  called ILLMO  was developed. This course will use examples of frequent statistical tasks such as hypothesis testing  linear regression and clustering to introduce the key concepts underlying intuitive and interactive statistics.
Ethnographic Methods for Human Factors Researchers: Collecting and Interweaving Threads of HCI,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Argyll 3 CROWNE,Frauke Mörike  Technische Universität Berlin,This course offers an introduction to ethnography for Human Factors Research. It covers relevant topics along the research process from decision arguments for the method and study design  up to data collection  analysis and interpretation. Ethical questions will include the researcher's role(s) in the field and modes of data presentation. The collection of multi-dimensional sets of data – a trademark of high-quality ethnographic work – enables inter-weaving threads of HCI perspectives in complex human factors and user research contexts. To achieve this  a comprehensive toolbox of ethnographic methods is introduced along with practical hands-on sessions to familiarize with these methodological instruments.
Understanding Personal Productivity: How Knowledge Workers Define  Evaluate  and Reflect on Their Productivity,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Boisdale 1,Young-Ho Kim  Seoul National University Eun Kyoung Choe  University of Maryland Bongshin Lee  Microsoft Research Jinwook Seo  Seoul National University,Productivity tracking tools often determine productivity based on the time interacting with work-related applications. To deconstruct productivity's diverse and nebulous nature  we investigate how knowledge workers conceptualize personal productivity and delimit productive tasks in both work and non-work contexts. We report a 2-week diary study followed by a semi-structured interview with 24 knowledge workers. Participants captured productive activities and provided the rationale for why the activities were assessed to be productive. They reported a wide range of productive activities beyond typical desk-bound work–ranging from having a personal conversation with dad to getting a haircut. We found six themes that characterize the productivity assessment–work product  time management  worker's state  attitude toward work  impact & benefit  and compound task–and identified how participants interleaved multiple facets when assessing their productivity. We discuss how these findings could inform the design of a comprehensive productivity tracking system that covers a wide range of productive activities.
Beyond "One-Size-Fits-All": Understanding the Diversity in How Software Newcomers Discover and Make Use of Help Resources,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Boisdale 1,Kimia Kiani  Simon Fraser University George Cui  Simon Fraser University Andrea Bunt  University of Manitoba Joanna McGrenere  University of British Columbia Parmit K. Chilana  Simon Fraser University,For most modern feature-rich software  considerable external help and learning resources are available on the web (e.g.  documentation  tutorials  videos  Q&A forums). But  how do users new to an application discover and make use of such resources? We conducted in-lab and diary studies with 26 software newcomers from a variety of different backgrounds who were all using Fusion 360  a 3D modeling application  for the first time. Our results illustrate newcomers' diverse needs  perceptions  and help-seeking behaviors. We found a number of distinctions in how technical and non-technical users approached help-seeking  including: when and how they initiated the help-seeking process  their struggles in recognizing relevant help  the degree to which they made coordinated use of the application and different resources  and in how they perceived the utility of different help formats. We discuss implications for moving beyond "one-size-fits-all" help resources towards more structured  personalized  and curated help and learning materials.
Conservation of Procrastination: Do Productivity Interventions Save Time Or Just Redistribute It?,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Boisdale 1,Geza Kovacs  Stanford University Drew Mylander Gregory  Stanford University Zilin Ma  Bucknell University Zhengxuan Wu  Stanford University Golrokh Emami  Stanford University Jacob Ray  Stanford University Michael S. Bernstein  Stanford University,Productivity behavior change systems help us reduce our time on unproductive activities. However  is that time actually saved  or is it just redirected to other unproductive activities? We report an experiment using HabitLab  a behavior change browser extension and phone application  that manipulated the frequency of interventions on a focal goal and measured the effects on time spent on other applications and platforms. We find that  when intervention frequency increases on the focal goal  time spent on other applications is held constant or even reduced. Likewise  we find that time is not redistributed across platforms from browser to mobile phone or vice versa. These results suggest that any conservation of procrastination effect is minimal  and that behavior change designers may target individual productivity goals without causing substantial negative second-order effects.
PledgeWork: Online Volunteering through Crowdwork,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Boisdale 1,Keiko Katsuragawa  University of Waterloo Qi Shu  University of Waterloo Edward Lank,In this paper  we explore an alternative form of volunteer work  PledgeWork  where individuals  rather than working directly for a charity  make indirect donations by completing tasks provided by a third party task provider. PledgeWork poses novel research questions on issues of user acceptance of on-line volunteerism  on quality and quantity of work performed as a volunteer  and on the benefits low-barrier volunteerism might provide to charities. To evaluate these questions  we conduct a mixed methods study that compares the quality and quantity of work between volunteer workers and paid workers and user attitudes toward PledgeWork  including perceived benefits and drawbacks. We find that PledgeWork can improve the quality of simple tasks and that the vast majority of our participants expressed interest in using our PledgeWork platform to contribute to a charity. Our interview also reveals current problems with volunteering and online donations  thus highlighting additional strengths of PledgeWork.
Modeling the Engagement-Disengagement Cycle of Compulsive Phone Use,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Jonathan A. Tran  University of Washington Katie S. Yang  University of Washington Katie Davis  University of Washington Alexis Hiniker  University of Washington,Many smartphone users engage in compulsive and habitual phone checking they find frustrating  yet our understanding of how this phenomenon is experienced is limited. We conducted a semi-structured interview  a think-aloud phone-use demonstration  and a sketching exercise with 39 smartphone users (ages 14-64) to probe their experiences with compulsive phone checking. Their insights revealed a small taxonomy of common triggers that lead up to instances of compulsive phone use and a second set that end compulsive phone use sessions. Though participants expressed frustration with their lack of self-control  they also reported that the activities they engage in during these sessions can be meaningful  which they defined as transcending the current instance of use. Participants said they periodically reflect on their compulsive use and delete apps that drive compulsive checking without providing sufficient meaning. We use these findings to create a descriptive model of the cycle of compulsive checking  and we call on designers to craft experiences that meet users' definition of meaningfulness rather than creating lock-out mechanisms to help them police their own use.
Understanding Perceptions of Problematic Facebook Use: When People Experience Negative Life Impact and a Lack of Control,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Justin Cheng  Facebook Moira Burke  Facebook Elena Goetz Davis  Facebook,While many people use social network sites to connect with friends and family  some feel that their use is problematic  seriously affecting their sleep  work  or life. Pairing a survey of 20 000 Facebook users measuring perceptions of problematic use with behavioral and demographic data  we examined Facebook activities associated with problematic use as well as the kinds of people most likely to experience it. People who feel their use is problematic are more likely to be younger  male  and going through a major life event such as a breakup. They spend more time on the platform  particularly at night  and spend proportionally more time looking at profiles and less time browsing their News Feeds. They also message their friends more frequently. While they are more likely to respond to notifications  they are also more likely to deactivate their accounts  perhaps in an effort to better manage their time. Further  they are more likely to have seen content about social media or phone addiction. Notably  people reporting problematic use rate the site as more valuable to them  highlighting the complex relationship between technology use and well-being. A better understanding of problematic Facebook use can inform the design of context-appropriate and supportive tools to help people become more in control.
Keeping Rumors in Proportion: Managing Uncertainty in Rumor Systems,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Peter Krafft  University of Washington Emma S. Spiro  University of Washington,The study of rumors has garnered wider attention as regulators and researchers turn towards problems of misinformation on social media. One goal has been to discover and implement mechanisms that promote healthy information ecosystems. Classically defined as regarding ambiguous situations  rumors pose the unique difficulty of intrinsic uncertainty around their veracity. Further complicating matters  rumors can serve the public when they do spread valuable true information. To address these challenges  we develop an approach that reifies "rumor proportions" as central to the theory of systems for managing rumors. We use this lens to advocate for systems that  rather than aiming to stifle rumors entirely or aiming to stop only false rumors  aim to prevent rumors from growing out of proportion relative to normative benchmark representations of intrinsic uncertainty.
Email Makes You Sweat: Examining Email Interruptions and Stress Using Thermal Imaging,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Fatema Akbar  University of California  Irvine Ayse E. Bayraktaroglu  University of California  Irvine Pradeep Buddharaju  University of Houston Dennis Rodrigo Da Cunha Silva  Texas A&M University Ge Gao  University of California  Irvine Ted Grover  University of California  Irvine Ricardo Gutierrez-Osuna  Texas A&M University Nathan Cooper Jones  University of Houston Gloria Mark  University of California  Irvine Ioannis Pavlidis  University of Houston Kevin Storer  University of California  Irvine Zelun Wang  Texas A&M University Amanveer Wesley  University of Houston Shaila Zaman  University of Houston,Workplace environments are characterized by frequent interruptions that can lead to stress. However  measures of stress due to interruptions are typically obtained through self-reports  which can be affected by memory and emotional biases. In this paper  we use a thermal imaging system to obtain objective measures of stress and investigate personality differences in contexts of high and low interruptions. Since a major source of workplace interruptions is email  we studied 63 participants while multitasking in a controlled office environment with two different email contexts: managing email in batch mode or with frequent interruptions. We discovered that people who score high in Neuroticism are significantly more stressed in batching environments than those low in Neuroticism. People who are more stressed finish emails faster. Last  using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count on the email text  we find that higher stressed people in multitasking environments use more anger in their emails. These findings help to disambiguate prior conflicting results on email batching and stress.
Temporal Rhythms and Patterns of Electronic Documentation in Time-Critical Medical Work,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Swathi Jagannath  Drexel University Aleksandra Sarcevic  Drexel University Victoria Young  Drexel University Sage Myers  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,We examine nursing documentation on a newly implemented electronic flowsheet in medical resuscitations to identify the temporal patterns of documentation and how the recorded information supported time-critical teamwork. To determine when the information was documented  we compared timestamps from 58 flowsheet logs to those of verbal communications derived from video review. We also drew on observations of 95 resuscitations to understand the behaviors of nurse documenters. We found that only 8% of the verbal reports were documented in near real-time (one minute within the verbal report)  while 42% of reports were not documented in the electronic flowsheet. In addition  38% were documented early (before the verbal report) and 12% were documented with a delay  ranging from one to 58 minutes after the report. Our study showed that the electronic flowsheet design posed many challenges for real-time documentation  leading to paper-based workarounds and the use of free-text fields on the flowsheet to visualize and keep track of time  and to communicate temporal information to the team. These findings suggest that documenters shape the temporal rhythms of not only their own work but also the rhythms of the electronic record and medical process. We discuss the implications of these rhythms for EHR redesign to support real-time documentation in high-risk  safety-critical settings.
Impacts of Telemanipulation in Robotic Assisted Surgery,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Ignacio Avellino  Sorbonne Université  CNRS  ISIR Gilles Bailly  Sorbonne Université  CNRS  ISIR Geoffroy Canlorbe  Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière & Sorbonne Université Jeremie Belgihti  Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière Guillaume Morel  Sorbonne Université  CNRS  ISIR Marie-Aude Vitrani  Sorbonne Université  CNRS  ISIR,Robotic-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) is adopted more and more as it overcomes the shortcomings of classic MIS for surgeons while keeping the benefits of small incisions for patients. However  introducing new technology oftentimes affects the work of skilled practitioners. Our goals are to investigate the impacts of telemanipulated surgical robots on the work practices of surgical teams and to understand their cause. We conducted a field study observing 21 surgeries  conducting 12 interviews and performing 3 data validation sessions with surgeons. Using Thematic Analysis  we find that physically separating surgeons from their teams makes them more autonomous  shifts their use of perceptual senses  and turns the surgeon's assistant into the robot's assistant. We open design opportunities for the HCI field by questioning the telemanipulated approach and discussing alternatives that keep surgeons on the surgical field.
Electronic Health Records Are More Than a Work Tool: Conflicting Needs of Direct and Indirect Stakeholders,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Åsa Cajander  Uppsala University Christiane Grünloh  KTH Royal Institute of Technology & Technische Hochschule Köln,The involvement of stakeholders is crucial when designing IT in highly complex application domains  such as healthcare. Stakeholder relationships are complex and can include strongly conflicting needs and value tensions. In this case study  we investigate the different perspectives of patients and physicians related to Patient Accessible Electronic Health Records (PAEHR) in Sweden. Generally  the introduction of this service has been heavily criticised by healthcare professionals  but welcomed by patients. The paper presents an innovative study design where themes from interviews with physicians are used as a lens to analyse survey data from patients. The findings highlight the necessity to understand stakeholders' perspectives about other stakeholder groups by contrasting assumptions and expectations of physicians (indirect stakeholders) with experience of use by patients (direct stakeholders)  and discusses practical challenges when designing large-scale health information systems.
Evaluating the Impact of Pseudo-Colour and Coordinate System on the Detection of Medication-induced ECG Changes,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Alaa Alahmadi  University of Manchester Alan Davies  University of Manchester Jennifer Royle  CRUK Manchester Institute & The Christie NHS Foundation Markel Vigo  University of Manchester Caroline Jay  University of Manchester,The electrocardiogram (ECG)  a graphical representation of the heart's electrical activity  is used for detecting cardiac pathologies. Certain medications can produce a complication known as 'long QT syndrome'  shown on the ECG as an increased gap between two parts of the waveform. Self-monitoring for this could be lifesaving  as the syndrome can result in sudden death  but detecting it on the ECG is difficult. Here we evaluate whether using pseudo-colour to highlight wave length and changing the coordinate system can support lay people in identifying increases in the QT interval. The results show that introducing colour significantly improves accuracy  and that whilst it is easier to detect a difference without colour with Cartesian coordinates  the greatest accuracy is achieved when Polar coordinates are combined with colour. The results show that applying simple visualisation techniques has the potential to improve ECG interpretation accuracy  and support people in monitoring their own ECG.
Siri  Echo and Performance: You have to Suffer Darling,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Carron 2,Matthew P. Aylett  CereProc Ltd. Benjamin R. Cowan  UCD Leigh Clark  University College Dublin,Don't ignore this because its about speech technology. VUIs (voice user interfaces) won a best paper in CHI 2018. Did that get your attention? Good. Siri  Ivona  Google Home  and most speech synthesis systems have voices which are based on imitating a neutral citation style of speech and making it sound natural. But  in the real world  darling  people have to act  to perform! In this paper we will talk about speech synthesis as performance  why the uncanny valley is a bankrupt concept  and how academics can escape from studying corporate speech technology as if it's been bestowed by God.
Designing the Past,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Carron 2,Alessandro Soro  Queensland University of Technology Jennyfer Lawrence Taylor  Queensland University of Technology Margot Brereton  Queensland University of Technology,This paper challenges the position that design is a future oriented discipline  and rather turns an eye to the past as potential material for re-design. We claim that what we call 'the past' is far from static  monolithic  immutable  and is rather subjective  fluid  and constantly renegotiated. People constantly engage in re-designing the past by re-elaborating  reckoning  and plainly forgetting. The rewriting of the past  such as in historical revisionism  is often seen as an attempt to wipe-out  and hence re-inscribe and perpetuate  injustice  oppression  and even genocide. With this paper we call for more courage to take ownership of the past as something malleable  to take responsibility for it  and in so doing to open up design opportunities to a plurality of voices.
Let Us Say What We Mean: Towards Operational Definitions for Techno-Spirituality Research,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Carron 2,Elizabeth Buie  Sigma Consulting Solutions Ltd,Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in HCI research on the use of technology in spiritual practices and environments. Some of these works cover spiritual/transcendent experiences associated with these contexts  but strikingly few of them describe in any way the experiences they studied or aimed to support  let alone give definitions of the terms they use for those experiences. Even fewer papers cite any literature on the relevant experiences. We have to ask: How do the authors understand the experiences their work is aiming to observe  invite  or support? How do they know when and whether they have observed  invited  or supported the kinds of experiences they target? How do they know what they are studying? This paper discusses the presence and absence of definitions of terms for spiritual/transcendent experiences in HCI research  and of citations of relevant literature. It speculates about possible reasons for the oversight  proposes some definitions aimed at filling the gap  and suggests an approach to operationalizing some of the proposed definitions.
Cyborg Perspectives on Computing Research Reform,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Carron 2,Rua M. Williams  University of Florida Juan E. Gilbert  University of Florida,Recent exposures of extant and potentially discriminatory impacts of technological advancement have prompted members of the computing research field to reflect on their duty to actively predict and mitigate negative consequences of their work. In 2018  Hecht et al. proposed changes to the peer-review process attending to the computing research community's responsibility for impacts on society. In requiring researchers and reviewers to expressly consider the positive and negative consequences of each study  the hope is that our community can earnestly shape more ethical innovation and inquiry. We question whether most researchers have sufficient historical context and awareness of activist movements to recognize crucial impacts to marginalized populations. Drawing from the work of feminist theorists and critical disability scholars  we present case studies in leveraging "situated knowledges" in the analysis of research ethics.
Make This! Introduction to Electronics Prototyping Using Arduino,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,David Sirkin  Stanford University Nikolas Martelaro  Accenture Technology Labs Wendy Ju  Cornell Tech,This course is a hands-on introduction to interactive electronics prototyping for people with a variety of backgrounds  including those with no prior experience in electronics. Familiarity with programming is helpful  but not required. Participants learn basic electronics  microcontroller programming and physical prototyping using the Arduino platform  then use digital and analog sensors  LED lights and motors to build  program and customize a small paper robot.
Rapid Prototyping of Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality Interfaces,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Michael Nebeling  University of Michigan,This course introduces participants to rapid prototyping techniques for augmented reality and virtual reality interfaces. Participants will learn about both physical prototyping with paper and Play-Doh as well as digital prototyping via new visual authoring tools for AR/VR. The course is structured into four sessions. After an introduction to AR/VR prototyping principles and materials  the next two sessions are hands-on  allowing participants to practice new physical and digital prototyping techniques. These techniques use a combination of new paper-based AR/VR design templates and smartphone-based capture and replay tools  adapting Wizard of Oz for AR/VR design. The fourth and final session will allow participants to test and critique each other's prototypes while checking against emerging design principles and guidelines. The instructor has previously taught the techniques to broad student audiences with a wide variety of non-technical backgrounds  including design  architecture  business  medicine  education  and psychology  who shared a common interest in user experience and interaction design. The course is targeted at non-technical audiences including HCI practitioners  user experience researchers  and interaction design professionals and students. A useful byproduct of the course will be a small portfolio piece of a first AR/VR interface designed iteratively and collaboratively in teams.
Balancing Interaction Design,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Gilbert Cockton  Northumbria University,Over the last two decades  creative  lean and strategic design approaches have become increasingly prevalent in the development of interactive technologies  but tensions exist with longer established approaches such as human factors engineering and user-centered design. These tensions can be harnessed productively by first giving equal status in principle to creative  business and agile engineering practices  and then supporting this with flexible critical approaches and resources that can balance and integrate across a range of multidisciplinary design practices.
An Analytic Model for Time Efficient Personal Hierarchies,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,William Delamare  Kochi University of Technology & University of Manitoba Ali Neshati  University of Manitoba Pourang Irani  University of Manitoba Xiangshi Ren  Kochi University of Technology,Hierarchy structures such as file systems are widespread interfaces for item retrieval and selection tasks. Some hierarchies can be modified by end-users  such as application launchers on smartphones or pictures in a file folder. These modifiable hierarchies cannot benefit from an optimization made beforehand as their content  unknown during the design process  is constantly evolving. We hence propose an analytic model which designers can integrate in their system to recommend a range of local structure modifications (e.g.  creating new folders) to end-users. Proposing a range of modifications gives flexibility to end-users regarding their own meaningful grouping and labeling choices to follow a recommendation. A first experiment confirms that the recommendations built on our model can lead to modified hierarchies resulting in faster theoretical selection times. A second experiment confirms that the theoretical selection times fit empirical selection times in different hierarchy visual layouts: linear  radial  and grid.
Text Entry Throughput: Towards Unifying Speed and Accuracy in a Single Performance Metric,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Mingrui Zhang  University of Washington Shumin Zhai  Google Jacob O. Wobbrock  University of Washington,Human-computer input performance inherently involves speed-accuracy tradeoffs---the faster users act  the more inaccurate those actions are. Therefore  comparing speeds and accuracies separately can result in ambiguous outcomes: Does a fast but inaccurate technique perform better or worse overall than a slow but accurate one? For pointing  speed and accuracy has been unified for over 60 years as throughput (bits/s) (Crossman 1957  Welford 1968)  but to date  no similar metric has been established for text entry. In this paper  we introduce a text entry method-independent throughput metric based on Shannon information theory (1948). To explore the practical usability of the metric  we conducted an experiment in which 16 participants typed with a laptop keyboard using different cognitive sets  i.e.  speed-accuracy biases. Our results show that as a performance metric  text entry throughput remains relatively stable under different speed-accuracy conditions. We also evaluated a smartphone keyboard with 12 participants  finding that throughput varied least compared to other text entry metrics. This work allows researchers to characterize text entry performance with a single unified measure of input efficiency.
Steering Performance with Error-accepting Delays,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Shota Yamanaka  Yahoo Japan Corporation,In steering law tasks  deviating from the path is immediately considered an error operation. However  in navigating a hierarchical menu item  which is a representative application of the law  a deviation within a short duration is sometimes permitted. We tested the validity of the steering law model with various durations of such error-accepting delays and found that it showed high fits for each delay condition (R^(2) > 0.96) but poor fits if the delay values were not separated (R^(2) = 0.58). Because the average movement speed linearly increased as the delay increased  we refined the model by taking the delay into account  and the fitness was significantly improved (R^(2) = 0.97). Our model will help GUI designers estimate the average operational time on the basis of the menu item length  width  and error-accepting delay.
Understanding and Modeling User-Perceived Brand Personality from Mobile Application UIs,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Ziming Wu  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Taewook Kim  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Quan Li  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Xiaojuan Ma  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Designers strive to make their mobile apps stand out in a competitive market by creating a distinctive brand personality. However  it is unclear whether users can form a consistent impression of brand personality by looking at a few user interface (UI) screenshots in the app store  and if this process can be modeled computationally. To bridge this gap  we first collect crowd assessment on brand personalities depicted by the UIs of 318 applications  and statistically confirm that users can reach substantial agreement. To further model how users process mobile UI visually  we compute UI descriptors including Color  Organization  and Texture at both element and page levels. We feed these descriptors to a computational model  achieving a high accuracy of predicting perceived brand personality (MSE = 0.035 and R^2 = 0.78). This work could benefit designers by highlighting contributing visual factors to brand personality creation and providing quick  low-cost design feedback.
Transcalibur: A Weight Shifting Virtual Reality Controller for 2D Shape Rendering based on Computational Perception Model,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Jotaro Shigeyama  The University of Tokyo Takeru Hashimoto  The University of Tokyo Shigeo Yoshida  The University of Tokyo Takuji Narumi  The University of Tokyo Tomohiro Tanikawa  The University of Tokyo Michitaka Hirose  The University of Tokyo,Humans can estimate the shape of a wielded object through the illusory feeling of the mass properties of the object obtained using their hands. Even though the shape of hand-held objects influences immersion and realism in virtual reality (VR)  it is difficult to design VR controllers for rendering desired shapes according to the perceptions derived from the illusory effects of mass properties and shape perception. We propose Transcalibur  which is a hand-held VR controller that can render a 2D shape by changing its mass properties on a 2D planar area. We built a computational perception model using a data-driven approach from the collected data pairs of mass properties and perceived shapes. This enables Transcalibur to easily and effectively provide convincing shape perception based on complex illusory effects. Our user study showed that the system succeeded in providing the perception of various desired shapes in a virtual environment.
Drag:on - A Virtual Reality Controller Providing Haptic Feedback Based on Drag and Weight Shift,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,André Zenner  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Antonio Krüger  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus,Standard controllers for virtual reality (VR) lack sophisticated means to convey a realistic  kinesthetic impression of size  resistance or inertia. We present the concept and implementation of Drag:on  an ungrounded shape-changing VR controller that provides dynamic passive haptic feedback based on drag  i.e. air resistance  and weight shift. Drag:on leverages the airflow occurring at the controller during interaction. By dynamically adjusting its surface area  the controller changes the drag and rotational inertia felt by the user. In a user study  we found that Drag:on can provide distinguishable levels of haptic feedback. Our prototype increases the haptic realism in VR compared to standard controllers and when rotated or swung improves the perception of virtual resistance. By this  Drag:on provides haptic feedback suitable for rendering different virtual mechanical resistances  virtual gas streams  and virtual objects differing in scale  material and fill state.
Pseudo-Haptic Weight: Changing the Perceived Weight of Virtual Objects By Manipulating Control-Display Ratio,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Majed Samad  Facebook Reality Labs Elia Gatti  Facebook Reality Labs Anne Hermes  Facebook Reality Labs Hrvoje Benko  Facebook Reality Labs Cesare Parise  Facebook Reality Labs,In virtual reality  the lack of kinesthetic feedback often prevents users from experiencing the weight of virtual objects. Control-to-display (C/D) ratio manipulation has been proposed as a method to induce weight perception without kinesthetic feedback. Based on the fact that lighter (heavier) objects are easier (harder) to move  this method induces an illusory perception of weight by manipulating the rendered position of users' hands---increasing or decreasing their displayed movements. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that C/D-ratio induces a genuine perception of weight  while preserving ownership over the virtual hand. This means that such a manipulation can be easily introduced in current VR experiences without disrupting the sense of presence. We discuss these findings in terms of estimation of physical work needed to lift an object. Our findings provide the first quantification of the range of C/D-ratio that can be used to simulate weight in virtual reality.
Slow Robots for Unobtrusive Posture Correction,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Joon-Gi Shin  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Eiji Onchi  University of Tsukuba Maria Jose Reyes  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Junbong Song  teamVoid Uichin Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Seung-Hee Lee  University of Tsukuba Daniel Saakes  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Prolonged static and unbalanced sitting postures during computer usage contribute to musculoskeletal discomfort. In this paper  we investigated the use of a very slow moving monitor for unobtrusive posture correction. In a first study  we identified display velocities below the perception threshold and observed how users (without being aware) responded by gradually following the monitor's motion. From the result  we designed a robotic monitor that moves imperceptible to counterbalance unbalanced sitting postures and induces posture correction. In an evaluation study (n=12)  we had participants work for four hours without and with our prototype (8 in total). Results showed that actuation increased the frequency of non-disruptive swift posture corrections and significantly reduced the duration of unbalanced sitting. Most users appreciated the monitor correcting their posture and reported less physical fatigue. With slow robots  we make the first step toward using actuated objects for unobtrusive behavioral changes.
Using Presence Questionnaires in Virtual Reality,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Valentin Schwind  University of Stuttgart Pascal Knierim  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Nico Haas  University of Stuttgart Niels Henze  University of Regensburg,Virtual Reality (VR) is gaining increasing importance in science  education  and entertainment. A fundamental characteristic of VR is creating presence  the experience of 'being' or 'acting'  when physically situated in another place. Measuring presence is vital for VR research and development. It is typically repeatedly assessed through questionnaires completed after leaving a VR scene. Requiring participants to leave and re-enter the VR costs time and can cause disorientation. In this paper  we investigate the effect of completing presence questionnaires directly in VR. Thirty-six participants experienced two immersion levels and filled three standardized presence questionnaires in the real world or VR. We found no effect on the questionnaires' mean scores; however  we found that the variance of those measures significantly depends on the realism of the virtual scene and if the subjects had left the VR. The results indicate that  besides reducing a study's duration and reducing disorientation  completing questionnaires in VR does not change the measured presence but can increase the consistency of the variance.
Mind the Tap: Assessing Foot-Taps for Interacting with Head-Mounted Displays,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Florian Müller  TU Darmsatdt Joshua McManus  Simon Fraser University Sebastian Günther  TU Darmstadt Martin Schmitz  TU Darmstadt Max Mühlhäuser  TU Darmstadt Markus Funk  TU Darmstadt,From voice commands and air taps to touch gestures on frames: Various techniques for interacting with head-mounted displays (HMDs) have been proposed. While these techniques have both benefits and drawbacks dependent on the current situation of the user  research on interacting with HMDs has not concluded yet. In this paper  we add to the body of research on interacting with HMDs by exploring foot-tapping as an input modality. Through two controlled experiments with a total of 36 participants  we first explore direct interaction with interfaces that are displayed on the floor and require the user to look down to interact. Secondly  we investigate indirect interaction with interfaces that  although operated by the user's feet  are always visible as they are floating in front of the user. Based on the results of the two experiments  we provide design recommendations for direct and indirect foot-based user interfaces.
Evaluating the Combination of Visual Communication Cues for HMD-based Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Seungwon Kim  University of South Australia Gun A. Lee  University of South Australia Weidong Huang  Swinburne University of Technology Hayun Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Woontack Woo  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Mark Billinghurst  University of South Australia,Many researchers have studied various visual communication cues (e.g. pointer  sketching  and hand gesture) in Mixed Reality remote collaboration systems for real-world tasks. However  the effect of combining them has not been so well explored. We studied the effect of these cues in four combinations: hand only  hand + pointer  hand + sketch  and hand + pointer + sketch  with three problem tasks: Lego  Tangram  and Origami. The study results showed that the participants completed the task significantly faster and felt a significantly higher level of usability when the sketch cue is added to the hand gesture cue  but not with adding the pointer cue. Participants also preferred the combinations including hand and sketch cues over the other combinations. However  using additional cues (pointer or sketch) increased the perceived mental effort and did not improve the feeling of co-presence. We discuss the implications of these results and future research directions.
Online  VR  AR  Lab  and In-Situ: Comparison of Research Methods to Evaluate Smart Artifacts,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Alexandra Voit  VIS Sven Mayer  University of Stuttgart Valentin Schwind  University of Stuttgart Niels Henze  University of Regensburg,Empirical studies are a cornerstone of HCI research. Technical progress constantly enables new study methods. Online surveys  for example  make it possible to collect feedback from remote users. Progress in augmented and virtual reality enables to collect feedback with early designs. In-situ studies enable researchers to gather feedback in natural environments. While these methods have unique advantages and disadvantages  it is unclear if and how using a specific method affects the results. Therefore  we conducted a study with 60 participants comparing five different methods (online  virtual reality  augmented reality  lab setup  and in-situ) to evaluate early prototypes of smart artifacts. We asked participants to assess four different smart artifacts using standardized questionnaires. We show that the method significantly affects the study result and discuss implications for HCI research. Finally  we highlight further directions to overcome the effect of the used methods.

"They Don't Leave Us Alone Anywhere We Go": Gender and Digital Abuse in South Asia,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Forth,Nithya Sambasivan  Google Amna Batool  Information Technology University Nova Ahmed  North South University Tara Matthews  Independent Researcher Kurt Thomas  Google Laura Sanely Gaytán-Lugo  Universidad de Colima David Nemer  University of Kentucky Elie Bursztein  Google Elizabeth F. Churchill  Google Sunny Consolvo  Google,South Asia faces one of the largest gender gaps online globally  and online safety is one of the main barriers to gender-equitable Internet access [GSMA  2015]. To better understand the gendered risks and coping practices online in South Asia  we present a qualitative study of the online abuse experiences and coping practices of 199 people who identified as women and 6 NGO staff from India  Pakistan  and Bangladesh  using a feminist analysis. We found that a majority of our participants regularly contended with online abuse  experiencing three major abuse types: cyberstalking  impersonation  and personal content leakages. Consequences of abuse included emotional harm  reputation damage  and physical and sexual violence. Participants coped through informal channels rather than through technological protections or law enforcement. Altogether  our findings point to opportunities for designs  policies  and algorithms to improve women's safety online in South Asia.
Threats  Abuses  Flirting  and Blackmail: Gender Inequity in Social Media Voice Forums,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Forth,Aditya Vashistha  University of Washington Abhinav Garg  University of Washington Richard Anderson  University of Washington Agha Ali Raza  Information Technology University,HCI4D researchers and practitioners have leveraged voice forums to enable people with literacy  socioeconomic  and connectivity barriers to access  report  and share information. Although voice forums have received impassioned usage from low-income  low-literate  rural  tribal  and disabled communities in diverse HCI4D contexts  the participation of women in these services is almost non-existent. In this paper  we investigate the reasons for the low participation of women in social media voice forums by examining the use of Sangeet Swara in India and Baang in Pakistan by marginalized women and men. Our mixed-methods approach spanning content analysis of audio posts  quantitative analysis of interactions between users  and qualitative interviews with users indicate gender inequity due to deep-rooted patriarchal values. We found that women on these forums faced systemic discrimination and encountered abusive content  flirts  threats  and harassment. We discuss design recommendations to create social media voice forums that foster gender equity in use of these services.
From Gender Biases to Gender-Inclusive Design: An Empirical Investigation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Forth,Mihaela Vorvoreanu  Microsoft Research & Purdue University Lingyi Zhang  Purdue University Yun-Han Huang  Purdue University Claudia Hilderbrand  Oregon State University Zoe Steine-Hanson  Oregon State University Margaret Burnett  Oregon State University,In recent years  research has revealed gender biases in numerous software products. But although some researchers have found ways to improve gender participation in specific software projects  general methods focus mainly on detecting gender biases -- not fixing them. To help fill this gap  we investigated whether the GenderMag bias detection method can lead directly to designs with fewer gender biases. In our 3-step investigation  two HCI researchers analyzed an industrial software product using GenderMag; we derived design changes to the product using the biases they found; and ran an empirical study of participants using the original product versus the new version. The results showed that using the method in this way did improve the software's inclusiveness: women succeeded more often in the new version than in the original; men's success rates improved too; and the gender gap entirely disappeared.
Protection  Productivity and Pleasure in the Smart Home: Emerging Expectations and Gendered Insights from Australian Early Adopters,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Forth,Yolande Strengers  Monash University Jenny Kennedy  RMIT University Paula Arcari  RMIT University Larissa Nicholls  RMIT University Melissa Gregg  Intel Corporation,Interest and uptake of smart home technologies has been lower than anticipated  particularly among women. Reporting on an academic-industry partnership  we present findings from an ethnographic study with 31 Australian smart home early adopters. The paper analyses these households' experiences in relation to three concepts central to Intel's ambient computing vision for the home: protection  productivity and pleasure  or 'the 3Ps'. We find that protection is a form of caregiving; productivity provides 'small conveniences'  energy savings and multi-tasking possibilities; and pleasure is derived from ambient and aesthetic features  and the joy of 'playing around' with tech. Our analysis identifies three design challenges and opportunities for the smart home: internal threats to household protection; feminine desires for the smart home; and increased 'digital housekeeping'. We conclude by suggesting how HCI designers can and should respond to these gendered challenges.
Virtual Performance Augmentation in an Immersive Jump & Run Exergame,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Gala,Christos Ioannou  University of Bath Patrick Archard  University of Bath Eamonn O'Neill  University of Bath Christof Lutteroth  University of Auckland & University of Bath,Human performance augmentation through technology has been a recurring theme in science and culture  aiming to increase human capabilities and accessibility. We investigate a related concept: virtual performance augmentation (VPA)  using VR to give users the illusion of greater capabilities than they actually have. We propose a method for VPA of running and jumping  based on in place movements  and studied its effects in a VR exergame. We found that in place running and jumping in VR can be used to create a somewhat natural experience and can elicit medium to high physical exertion in an immersive and intrinsically motivating manner. We also found that virtually augmenting running and jumping can increase intrinsic motivation  perceived competence and flow  and may also increase motivation for physical activity in general. We discuss implications of VPA for safety and accessibility  with initial evidence suggesting that VPA may help users with physical impairments enjoy the benefits of exergaming.
Abstract Machines: Overlaying Virtual Worlds on Physical Rides,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Gala,Paul Tennent  University of Nottingham Joe Marshall  University of Nottingham Patrick Brundell  University of Nottingham Brendan Walker  University of Nottingham Steve Benford  University of Nottingham,Overlaying virtual worlds onto existing physical rides and altering the sensations of motion can deliver new experiences of thrill  but designing how motion is mapped between physical ride and virtual world is challenging. In this paper  we present the notion of an abstract machine  a new form of intermediate design knowledge that communicates motion mappings at the level of metaphor  mechanism and implementation. Following a performance-led  in-the-wild approach we report lessons from creating and touring VR Playground  a ride that overlays four distinct abstract machines and virtual worlds on a playground swing. We compare the artist's rationale with riders' reported experiences and analysis of their physical behaviours to reveal the distinct thrills of each abstract machine. Finally  we discuss how to make and use abstract machines in terms of heuristics for designing motion mappings  principles for virtual world design and communicating experiences to riders.
A 2nd Person Social Perspective on Bodily Play,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Gala,Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University Zhuying Li  RMIT University Richard Byrne  RMIT University Yash Dhanpal Mehta  RMIT University Peter Arnold  RMIT University Tuomas Kari  RMIT University,Recent HCI work on digital games highlighted the advantage for designers to take on a 1st person perspective on the human body (referring to the phenomenological "lived" body) and a 3rd person perspective (the material "fleshy" body  similar to looking in the mirror). This is useful when designing bodily play  however  we note that there is not much game design discussion on the 2nd person social perspective that highlights the unique interplay between human bodies. To guide designers interested in supporting players to experience their bodies as play  we describe how game designers can engage with the 2nd person social perspective through a set of design tactics based on four of our own play systems. With our work  we hope we can aid designers in embracing this 2nd person perspective so that more people can benefit from engaging their bodies through games and play.
Pose-Guided Level Design,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Gala,Yongqi Zhang  University of Massachusetts Boston Biao Xie  University of Massachusetts Boston Haikun Huang  University of Massachusetts Boston Elisa Ogawa  University of Massachusetts Boston Tongjian You  University of Massachusetts Boston Lap-Fai Yu  George Mason University,Player's physical experience is a critical factor to consider in designing motion-based games that are played through motion sensor gaming consoles or virtual reality devices. However  adjusting the physical challenge involved in a motion-based game is difficult and tedious  as it is typically done manually by level designers on a trial-and-error basis. In this paper  we propose a novel approach for automatically synthesizing levels for motion-based games that can achieve desired physical movement goals. By formulating the level design problem as a trans-dimensional optimization problem which is solved by a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique  we show that our approach can automatically synthesize a variety of game levels  each carrying the desired physical movement properties. To demonstrate the generality of our approach  we synthesize game levels for two different types of motion-based games and conduct a user study to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
The Design of Social Drones: A Review of Studies on Autonomous Flyers in Inhabited Environments,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Mehmet Aydin Baytas  Koç University & Qualisys AB Damla Çay  Koç University Yuchong Zhang  Chalmers University of Technology Mohammad Obaid  University of New South Wales Asim Evren Yantaç  Koç University Morten Fjeld  Chalmers University of Technology,The design space of social drones  where autonomous flyers operate in close proximity to human users or bystanders  is distinct from use cases involving a remote human operator and/or an uninhabited environment; and warrants foregrounding human-centered design concerns. Recently  research on social drones has followed a trend of rapid growth. This paper consolidates the current state of the art in human-centered design knowledge about social drones through a review of relevant studies  scaffolded by a descriptive framework of design knowledge creation. Our analysis identified three high-level themes that sketch out knowledge clusters in the literature  and twelve design concerns which unpack how various dimensions of drone aesthetics and behavior relate to pertinent human responses. These results have the potential to inform and expedite future research and practice  by supporting readers in defining and situating their future contributions. The materials and results of our analysis are also published in an open online repository that intends to serve as a living hub for a community of researchers and designers working with social drones.
An Exploratory Study of the Use of Drones for Assisting Firefighters During Emergency Situations,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Md. Nafiz Hasan Khan  Simon Fraser University Carman Neustaedter  Simon Fraser University,In the near future  emergency services within Canada will be supporting new technologies for 9-1-1 call centres and firefighters to learn about an emergency situation. One such technology is drones. To understand the benefits and challenges of using drones within emergency response  we conducted a study with citizens who have called 9-1-1 and firefighters who respond to a range of everyday emergencies. Our results show that drones have numerous benefits to both firefighters and 9-1-1 callers which include context awareness and social support for callers who receive feelings of assurance that help is on the way. Privacy was largely not an issue  though safety issues arose especially for complex uses of drones such as indoor flying. Our results point to opportunities for designing drone systems that help people to develop a sense of trust with emergency response drones  and mitigate privacy and safety concerns with more complex drone systems.
Dancing With Drones: Crafting Novel Artistic Expressions Through Intercorporeality,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Sara Eriksson  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Åsa Unander-Scharin  Luleå University of Technology Vincent Trichon  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Carl Unander-Scharin  Karlstad University Hedvig Kjellström  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Kristina Höök  KTH Royal Institute of Technology,Movement-based interactions are gaining traction  requiring a better understanding of how such expressions are shaped by designers. Through an analysis of an artistic process aimed to deliver a commissioned opera where custom-built drones are performing on stage alongside human performers  we observed the importance of achieving an intercorporeal understanding to shape body-based emotional expressivity. Our analysis reveals how the choreographer moves herself to: (1) imitate and feel the affordances and expressivity of the drones' 'otherness' through her own bodily experience; (2) communicate to the engineer of the team how she wants to alter the drones' behaviors to be more expressive; (3) enact and interactively alter her choreography. Through months of intense development and creative work  such an intercorporeal understanding was achieved by carefully crafting the drones' behaviors  but also by the choreographer adjusting her own somatics and expressions. The choreography arose as a result of the expressivity they enabled together.
ZeRONE: Safety Drone with Blade-Free Propulsion,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Wataru Yamada  NTT DOCOMO Hiroyuki Manabe  NTT DOCOMO Daizo Ikeda  NTT DOCOMO,We present ZeRONE  a new indoor drone that does not use rotating blades for propulsion. The proposed device is a helium blimp type drone that uses the wind generated by the ultrasonic vibration of piezo elements for propulsion. Compared to normal drones with rotating propellers  the drone is much safer because its only moving parts are the piezo elements whose surfaces vibrate at the order of micrometers. The drone can float for a few weeks and the ultrasonic propulsion system is quiet. We implement a prototype of the drone and evaluate its performance and unique characteristics in experiments. Moreover  application scenarios in which ZeRONE coexists with people are also discussed.
More than the Sum of Makers: The Complex Dynamics of Diverse Practices at Maker Faire,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Janis Lena Meissner  Newcastle University Pradthana Jarusriboonchai  University of Lapland Janice McLaughlin  Newcastle University Peter Wright  Newcastle University,Human Computer Interaction has developed great interest in the Maker Movement. Previous work has explored it from various perspectives  focusing either on its potentials or issues. As these are however only fragmented portrayals  this paper aims to take a broader perspective and interconnect some of the fragments. We conducted a qualitative study in the context of two Maker Faires to gain a better understanding of the complex dynamics that makers operate in. We captured the voices of different stakeholders and explored how their respective agendas relate to each other. The findings illustrate how the event is co-created at the nexus of different technological  social and economic interests while leaving space for diverse practices. The paper contributes a first focused analysis of Maker Faire  probes it as a site for research and discusses how holistic perspectives on the Maker Movement could create new research opportunities.
Streaming  Multi-Screens and YouTube: The New (Unsustainable) Ways of Watching in the Home,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Kelly Widdicks  Lancaster University Mike Hazas  Lancaster University Oliver Bates  Lancaster University Adrian Friday  Lancaster University,Internet use and online services underpin everyday life  and the resultant energy demand is almost entirely hidden  yet significant and growing: it is anticipated to reach 21% of global electricity demand by 2030 and to eclipse half the greenhouse gas emissions of transportation by 2040. Driving this growth  real-time video streaming ('watching') is estimated at around 50% of all peak data traffic. Using a mixed-methods analysis of the use of 66 devices (e.g. smart TVs  tablets) across 20 participants in 9 households  we reveal the online activity of domestic watching and provide a detailed exploration of video-on-demand activities. We identify new ways in which watching is transitioning in more rather than less data demanding directions; and explore the role HCI may play in reducing this growing data demand. We further highlight implications for key HCI and societal stakeholders (policy makers  service providers  network engineers) to tackle this important issue.
"I feel it is my responsibility to stream": Streaming and Engaging with Intangible Cultural Heritage through Livestreaming,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Zhicong Lu  University of Toronto Michelle Annett  MishMashMakers Mingming Fan  University of Toronto Daniel Wigdor  University of Toronto,Globalization has led to the destruction of many cultural practices  expressions  and knowledge found within local communities. These practices  defined by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH)  have been identified  promoted  and safeguarded by nations  academia  organizations and local communities to varying degrees. Despite such efforts  many practices are still in danger of being lost or forgotten forever. With the increased popularity of livestreaming in China  some streamers have begun to use livestreaming to showcase and promote ICH activities. To better understand the practices  opportunities  and challenges inherent in sharing and safeguarding ICH through livestreaming  we interviewed 10 streamers and 8 viewers from China. Through our qualitative investigation  we found that ICH streamers had altruistic motivations and engaged with viewers using multiple modalities beyond livestreams. We also found that livestreaming encouraged real-time interaction and sociality  while non-live curated videos attracted attention from a broader audience and assisted in the archiving of knowledge.
Understanding Mass-Market Mobile TV Behaviors in the Streaming Era,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Frank Bentley  Yahoo & Oath Danielle Lottridge  Yahoo & Oath,Despite claims of Mobile TV's mainstream arrival in 2010  it took until 2017 for watching professionally-produced television content on mobile phones to truly become a mass-market phenomenon in America  with half of all TV content expected to be watched on mobile phones by 2020. But what professionally produced content are people watching on their phones and when are they watching it? Are there any clusters of behavior that emerge in the broader population when it comes to watching TV on the phone? We set out to answer these questions through two surveys deployed to representative samples of online Americans. We discuss our findings on the mass-market arrival of mobile TV viewing and differences from how the HCI community has previously envisioned mobile video. We conclude with implications for the design of future mobile TV systems.
Refugees & HCI SIG: Situating HCI Within Humanitarian Research,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Island A CROWNE,Reem Talhouk  Newcastle University Konstantin Aal  University of Siegen Anne Weibert  University of Siegen Max Krüger  University of Siegen Volker Wulf  University of Siegen Karen Fisher  University of Washington Franziska Tachtler  TU Wien Suleman Shahid  Lahore University of Management Sciences Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed  University of Toronto Ana Maria Bustamante Duarte  University of Münster,Currently  the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees estimates that there are around 65.8 million forcibly displaced people worldwide [16]. As digital technologies have become more available  humanitarian researchers and organizations have begun to explore how technologies may be used to address refugee needs under the umbrella of Digital Humanitarianism. Interest in refugee and humanitarian contexts has also been expressed within the HCI community through the organization of workshops at conferences. While previous engagements within the HCI community have focused on our experiences of working within refugee contexts as well as developing a common research agenda  we have yet to explore how HCI research fits within wider humanitarian research and in relation to digital humanitarianism. This SIG invites HCI researchers to engage in discussions on situating HCI research within humanitarian research and response.
Communicating your Research to the Public and the Press,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Island B CROWNE,Helen Pilcher,Researchers are increasingly called upon to communicate with non-specialist audiences  but it can be difficult to communicate complex scientific topics in a way that makes them accessible and engaging to people outside the field. Further  interacting with the media can be daunting and frustrating and researchers frequently comment on how their work is misrepresented in the popular press. This course aims to give participants the skills needed to interact confidently with the media and to non-specialists  and get their key messages across.
May AI? Design Ideation with Cooperative Contextual Bandits,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Lomond,Janin Koch  Aalto University Andrés Lucero  Aalto University Lena Hegemann  Aalto University Antti Oulasvirta  Aalto University,Design ideation is a prime creative activity in design. However  it is challenging to support computationally due to its quickly evolving and exploratory nature. The paper presents cooperative contextual bandits (CCB) as a machine-learning method for interactive ideation support. A CCB can learn to propose domain-relevant contributions and adapt their exploration/exploitation strategy. We developed a CCB for an interactive design ideation tool that 1) suggests inspirational and situationally relevant materials ("may AI?"); 2) explores and exploits inspirational materials with the designer; and 3) explains its suggestions to aid reflection. The application case of digital mood board design is presented  wherein visual inspirational materials are collected and curated in collages. In a controlled study  14 of 16 professional designers preferred the CCB-augmented tool. The CCB approach holds promise for ideation activities wherein adaptive and steerable support is welcome but designers must retain full outcome control.
Designing Theory-Driven User-Centric Explainable AI,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Lomond,Danding Wang  National University of Singapore Qian Yang  Carnegie Mellon University Ashraf Abdul  National University of Singapore Brian Y. Lim  National University of Singapore,From healthcare to criminal justice  artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly supporting high-consequence human decisions. This has spurred the field of explainable AI (XAI). This paper seeks to strengthen empirical application-specific investigations of XAI by exploring theoretical underpinnings of human decision making  drawing from the fields of philosophy and psychology. In this paper  we propose a conceptual framework for building human-centered  decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework  we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter  we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally  we discuss implications for XAI design and development.
In a Silent Way: Communication Between AI and Improvising Musicians Beyond Sound,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Lomond,Jon McCormack  Monash University Toby Gifford  Monash University Patrick Hutchings  Monash University Maria Teresa Llano Rodriguez  Goldsmiths  University of London Matthew Yee-King  Goldsmiths  University of London Mark d'Inverno  Goldsmiths  University of London,Collaboration is built on trust  and establishing trust with a creative Artificial Intelligence is difficult when the decision process or internal state driving its behaviour isn't exposed. When human musicians improvise together  a number of extra-musical cues are used to augment musical communication and expose mental or emotional states which affect musical decisions and the effectiveness of the collaboration. We developed a collaborative improvising AI drummer that communicates its confidence through an emoticon-based visualisation. The AI was trained on musical performance data  as well as real-time skin conductance  of musicians improvising with professional drummers  exposing both musical and extra-musical cues to inform its generative process. Uni- and bi-directional extra-musical communication with real and false values were tested by experienced improvising musicians. Each condition was evaluated using the FSS-2 questionnaire  as a proxy for musical engagement. The results show a positive correlation between extra-musical communication of machine internal state and human musical engagement.
Will You Accept an Imperfect AI? Exploring Designs for Adjusting End-user Expectations of AI-powered Systems,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 09:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 10:20,Lomond,Rafal Kocielnik  University of Washington Saleema Amershi  Microsoft Research Paul N. Bennett  Microsoft Research AI,AI technologies have been incorporated into many end-user applications. However  expectations of the capabilities of such systems vary among people. Furthermore  bloated expectations have been identified as negatively affecting perception and acceptance of such systems. Although the intelligibility of ML algorithms has been well studied  there has been little work on methods for setting appropriate expectations before the initial use of an AI-based system. In this work  we use a Scheduling Assistant - an AI system for automated meeting request detection in free-text email - to study the impact of several methods of expectation setting. We explore two versions of this system with the same 50% level of accuracy of the AI component but each designed with a different focus on the types of errors to avoid (avoiding False Positives vs. False Negatives). We show that such different focus can lead to vastly different subjective perceptions of accuracy and acceptance. Further  we design expectation adjustment techniques that prepare users for AI imperfections and result in a significant increase in acceptance.

DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.
DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of "futuring" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities.
DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.
DC09: Player Types of Gamers: Critical Evaluation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Suvi K. Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.
DC20: Co-Designing Digital Technologies to Support Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Cara Wilson  Queensland University of Technology,This doctoral work considers how to best co-design with minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum in classroom contexts. It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.
DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.

Joseph  National Institute of Design Lamha Bijili  National Institute of Design Md. Aasif Anwar  National Institute of Design Urvi  National Institute of Design,The current Indian education system promotes competition among students  emphasizing highly on ranks and marks scored. As a consequence  students tend to drift away from a collaborative mindset to a competitive one. The learning gap is even larger in schools catering to lower income groups due to the absence of digital infrastructure and digital knowledge. As a result  a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge  the internet  causing the gap to increase between students in the society. With co ed  we attempt to bridge these gaps by providing a platform to foster mutual learning as well as combining digital mediums and the long-established pen and paper in a seamless manner.
SDC03: Drawxi: An Accessible Drawing Tool for Collaboration,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Suraj Chiplunkar  Indiana University Anany Maini  Indiana University Dinesh Ram  Indiana University Zixuan Zheng  Indiana University Yaxin Zheng  Indiana University Bloomington,Visual impairment can profoundly impact well-being and social advancement. Current solutions for accessing graphical information fail to provide an affordable  user-friendly collaborative platform for visually impaired and sighted people to work together. Therefore  sighted users tend to have low expectations from visually impaired people while working in a team. Hence  visually impaired people feel discouraged to participate in a mixed population collaborative environment. Consequently  their generative capabilities remain devalued. In this paper  we propose an audio-haptic enabled tool (Drawxi) for free-form sketching and sharing simple diagrams (processes  workflows  ideas  perspectives  etc.). It provides a common platform for visually-impaired and sighted people to work together by communicating each other's ideas visually. Thus  enabling the discovery of generative capabilities in a hands-on way. We relied upon participatory research methods (Contextual inquiry  Co-Design) involving visually impaired participants throughout the design process. We evaluated our proposed design through usability testing which revealed that collaboration between visually impaired and sighted people benefits from the use of common tools and platforms. Thereby  enhancing the degree of their participation in a collaborative environment and quality of co-creation activities.
SDC04: Shadoji: View Body Shapes from a Different Angle,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xuan Jin  University of Michigan Peipei Nie  University of Michigan Xizi Wang  University of Michigan Zhuo Wang  University of Michigan Chunying Zhang  University of Michigan,Body shape anxiety is one of the common problems distressing people around the world. While people are constantly suffering from body shape anxiety  they do not realize that beauty standard is not an absolute truth and that it is changing and depends on time and space. To help people free from the constraint imposed by social beauty standards and connect those who have concerns over their body shape  we devised a technological solution named "Shadoji"  which can bring people a new perspective on their body shapes  give them a chance to create their unique body shape emoji  and to explore diverse body shapes from users around the world.
SDC05: Give Me a Break: Design for Communication Among Family Caregivers and Respite Caregivers,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Flannery Currin  Earlham College Gustavo Razo  University of California  Merced Aehong Min  Indiana University Bloomington,This study focuses on solutions to issues that arise from gaps in communication between primary family caregivers of older adults and respite caregivers. We collected data through 18 semi-structured interviews with primary family and respite caregivers and qualitatively analyzed the interviews to extract common needs. Participants identified three main needs that our designs address: building trust through status updates  learning routines & care management  and accessing technology. Based on those needs  we designed a prototype of an application which connects primary family caregivers with respite caregivers and facilitates communication between the involved parties. This design can serve as a framework for future work designed to improve elder care in general  the well-being of caregivers  and the effectiveness of respite care.
SDC06: Amor: Supporting Emerging Adult Couples to Manage Finances for a Common Goal,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mintra Ruensuk  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Jayeong Yoon  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Cho eun Park  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,A healthy romantic relationship is one of the life goals of many couples. Sharing feelings  emotions  thoughts  activities  and even finances enables couples to spend quality time with each other. In particular  financial management plays an important role in relationship quality of emerging adult couples. We present Amor  a mobile application that bridges emerging adult couples closely to pool and spend their money together for a common goal. Amor also allows the couples to explore activities that harmonize with their characteristics as well as an encouragement for the two to achieve their desired goals.
SDC07: SENTI? Reconnect with Yourself to Better Connect with Others,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Audrey Drolet  Université Laval Thomas Lemonde-Marzell  Université Laval Pablo Matos Da Silva  Université Laval Kim Lamontagne  Université Laval Marjorie Bédard  Université Laval,Occidental societies are becoming increasingly demanding. Citizens often feel overwhelmed and feel the need to rest  which they do so by isolating themselves from others. Individuals who use this time alone to reflect on their situation find that this reflection helps create deeper connections with others afterwards. With this in mind  we developed Senti?  a solution that aims to encourage people to take time for themselves in hopes that it will lead them to be more open-minded when interacting with others. The solution helps people focus on bodily sensations and generates a comfortable and effortless time for introspection. Senti? uses the subconscious benefits of perceiving one's heartbeat to foster personal reflection.
SDC08: Haptic Remembrance Book Series,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Elaine Czech  Keio University Mina Shibasaki  Keio University Keitaro Tsuchiya  Keio University,While having strong social networks is essential for good quality of life  socializing gets more difficult as we age even if we are surrounded by people in a nursing home setting. Care staff and family members want to be able to connect with residents/loved ones but have limitations (time constraints  unsure how)  and it can be challenging to feel a connection to another resident who has differing abilities. We propose that through sharing strong positive memories  members of a nursing home community (residents  care staff  and families) will be able to build empathy for one another and thus strengthen their community bonds. By applying multi-modal technologies to a familiar medium  the book  we provided a means by which intergenerational users  from various backgrounds  could interact with and gain meaning from the content.
SDC09: HelloBox: Creating Safer and Kid-friendly Communities,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tab Zhang  University of Minnesota Yongle Zhang  University of Minnesota Leyi Sun  University of Minnesota Lily Dunk  University of Minnesota,Children's ability to walk to school or play around their neighborhoods without parental supervision has severely declined in the past decade. Loss of local activities and mobility may leave children prepared for transitions to adulthood and make them less independent and may have negative health effects. In this paper  we discuss the findings of our research on children's unsupervised play in their neighborhoods. We propose HelloBox  a system including an app  wearable RFID tags  and check-in stations to keep track of children when they are outside without an adult. HelloBox lets parents know where their children are without restricting their independence and builds community between local families. The project focuses on improving children's independent mobility and encouraging social interactions between families within neighborhoods.
SDC10: HearU: An Integrated System to Raise Awareness of Hearing Loss,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Beijia Wang  University of Washington Mengxiao Song  University of Washington Yuting Han  University of Washington Duo Wang  University of Washington,Hearing loss is a prevalent public health crisis that often goes unnoticed in public eye due to its invisibility. People who are hard of hearing (HH) often experience social isolation caused by the lack of understanding from the hearing community. Our research revealed that there is a communication gap between the hearing and HH communities. The current state of art tends to focus on assisting HH people to participate in conversations  which places more responsibility on the HH community. There is a lack of responsibility of people in the hearing community. However  communication works in two directions; it requires both parties to take responsibility. In this paper  we present HearU - an integrated  multichannel system that includes public interaction. Through the creation of an immersive experience that increases people's awareness of hearing loss  we aim to use HearU as a medium to weave these two communities together as a whole.
SDC11: PALS: Patching ALS through Crowdsourced Advice  Social Links & Public Awareness,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Richard Cave  University College London Karina Kocemba  University College London Svjetlana Dajic  University College London Holloe Bostock  University College London Alastair Cook  University College London,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a serious and poorly understood disease  impacting 50 000 people a year globally. Our research found that people with ALS express a lack of connection with other people with the disease  and that the general public lacks awareness about ALS. We also identified an engagement problem with the currently available resources to connect and support people with ALS. To address these issues  we introduce 'PALS' - an accessible crowdsourcing and connection quilt  first hung like a tapestry in the ALS clinic  then later used as an interactive public display. The quilt offers the opportunity to access crowdsourced information concerning individual experiences of ALS. Our work offers three primary contributions: 1) adding to limited HCI research concerning the ALS community by establishing the needs  2) applying the 'PALS' quilt design solution to these needs  and 3) combining three modalities: crowdsourcing  tangible tapestry displays  and interactive waiting education in a unique way.
SDC12: TechBuddies: Engaging Students to Teach Retirees about Technology,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jim Philippe Neussl  University College London Rebecca Zheng  University College London George Hanson  University College London Boyin Yang  University College London,Retirees suffer from impaired mobility  loss of friends and family  and loneliness. Although these problems could be mitigated through the use of digital communication devices and the internet  many retirees lack the skill and confidence to use them effectively. The existing community initiatives that aim to help retirees understand technology often lack volunteers to teach them. This is why we developed TechBuddies  a two-component system aimed at engaging more students as volunteers. The first component consists of an interactive display that raises awareness about volunteering opportunities by simulating an interaction between a retiree and the potential volunteer. The second component involves an app-based platform that facilitates communication about events and encourages long-term engagement. TechBuddies raises awareness about and provides a platform for inter-generational interactions between students and retirees who are a part of the same local community.
LBW0111: Scratch Nodes ML: A Playful System for Children to Create Gesture Recognition Classifiers,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Adam Agassi  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Hadas Erel  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Iddo Yehoshua Wald  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Oren Zuckerman  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC),Children are growing up in a Machine Learning infused world and it's imperative to provide them with opportunities to develop an accurate understanding of basic Machine Learning concepts. Physical gesture recognition is a typical application of Machine Learning  and physical gestures are also an integral part of children's lives  including sports and play. We present Scratch Nodes ML  a system enabling children to create personalized gesture recognizers by: (1) Creating their own gesture classes; (2) Collecting gesture data for each class; (3) Evaluating the classifier they created with new gesture data; (4) Integrating their classifiers into the Scratch environment as new Scratch blocks  empowering other children to use these new blocks as gesture classifiers in their own Scratch creations.
LBW0112: Cross-country User Connections in an Online Social Network for Music,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Christine Bauer  Johannes Kepler University Linz Markus Schedl  Johannes Kepler University Linz,Social connections and cultural aspects play important roles in shaping an individual's preferences. For instance  people tend to select friends with similar music preferences. Furthermore  preferences and friending are influenced by cultural aspects. Recommender systems may benefit from these phenomena by using knowledge about the nature of social ties to better tailor recommendations to an individual. Focusing on the specifities of music preferences  we study user connections on Last.fm---an online social network for music. We identify those countries whose users are mainly connected within the same country  and those countries that are characterized by cross-country user connections. Strong cross-country connection pairs are typically characterized by similar cultural  historic  or linguistic backgrounds  or geographic proximity. The United States  the United Kingdom  and Russia are identified as countries having a large relative amount of user connections from other countries. Our results contribute to understanding the complexity of social ties and how they are reflected in connection behavior  and are a promising source for advancements of personalized systems.
LBW0113: Character Alive: A Tangible Reading and Writing System for Chinese Children At-risk for Dyslexia,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Min Fan  Simon Fraser University Jianyu Fan  Simon Fraser University Alissa N. Antle  Simon Fraser University Sheng Jin  Communication University of Zhejiang Dongxu Yin  Communication University of Zhejiang Philippe Pasquier  Simon Fraser University,This paper presents Character Alive  a tangible system designed to improve early Chinese literacy acquisition for Mandarin-speaking children at-risk for dyslexia by enabling high-level interaction. Character Alive uses the multisensory training method to teach children the reading and writing of Chinese characters and words. The core design features of our system are augmented dynamic color cues  2D radical cards and handwriting cards with tactile cues  and multimedia content such as character animations. Character Alive was built on our previous work on designing tangible and augmented reality reading and writing systems for children at-risk for dyslexia in English. Our previous work has demonstrated that dynamic color cues can draw children's attention to key characteristics of letter-sound-correspondences and two-hand actions with tangible letters help children to better solve spelling tasks. We present the design rationale  the design and implementation of the Character Alive system  and the future plan on evaluating the system.
LBW0114: LookUnlock: Using Spatial-Targets for User-Authentication on HMDs,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Markus Funk  Siemens CT & Technische Universität Darmstadt Karola Marky  Technische Universität Darmstadt Iori Mizutani  Siemens CT & University of St. Gallen Mareike Kritzler  Siemens CT Simon Mayer  Siemens CT & University of St. Gallen Florian Michahelles  Siemens CT,With head-mounted displays (HMDs)  users can access and interact with a broad range of applications and data. Although some of this information is privacy-sensitive or even confidential  no intuitive  unobtrusive and secure authentication technique is available yet for HMDs. We present LookUnlock  an authentication technique for HMDs that uses passwords that are composed of spatial and virtual targets. Through a proof-of-concept implementation and security evaluation  we demonstrate that this technique can be efficiently used by people and is resistant to shoulder-surfing attacks.
LBW0115: Weaving the Topics of CHI: Using Citation Network Analysis to Explore Emerging Trends,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Clement Lee  Newcastle University Andrew Garbett  Newcastle University Junyan Wang  Newcastle University Bingzhang Hu  Newcastle University Dan Jackson  Newcastle University,This paper provides a comprehensive and novel analysis of the annual conference proceedings of CHI to explore the structure and evolution of the community. Self-awareness is healthy for a diverse and dynamic community  allowing it to anticipate and respond to emerging themes. Instead of using a traditional topic modelling approach to analyze the text of the papers  we adopt a social network analysis approach by analyzing the citation network of papers. After constructing such a citation network  community detection is applied in order to cluster papers into different groups. The keywords of these groups are found to represent different research themes in human-computer interaction  while the growth or decline of these groups is visualized by their paper shares over time. Lastly  we contribute a visualization tool for exploring emerging trends within our community  which can be used to predict likely topics at future CHI conferences.
LBW0116: HandiFly: Towards Interactions to Support Drone Pilots with Disabilities,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jérémie Garcia  ENAC  Université de Toulouse Luc Chevrier  ENAC  Université de Toulouse Yannick Jestin  ENAC  Université de Toulouse Anke M. Brock  ENAC  Université de Toulouse,This paper describes two studies with people with sensory  cognitive and motor impairments flying drones as a leisure activity. We found that despite several adaptations to existing technologies that match their abilities  flying remains very difficult due to the required perceptual and motor skills. We propose an adaptation space at hardware  software and automation levels to facilitate drone piloting. Based on this adaptation space  we designed HandiFly  a software for piloting drones which is adaptable to users' abilities. Participants were able to fly and emphasized its ability to be tailored to specific needs. We conclude with future direction to make drone piloting a more inclusive activity.
LBW0117: My First Biolab: A System for Hands-On Biology Experiments,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Gilad Gome  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Yuval Fein  The Interdisciplinary center (IDC) Herzliya Julian Waksberg  The Interdisciplinary center (IDC) Herzliya Yuval Maayan  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Andrey Grishko  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Iddo Yehoshua Wald  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Oren Zuckerman  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya,Biology labs routinely conduct direct experimentation with living organisms. However  most high-schools are not able to engage students in such experimentation due to multiple factors: sterility  cost of equipment  cost of skilled lab assistants  and difficulty measuring micro-scale processes. We present the design and implementation of My First Biolab (MFB)  a lab in a box with a novel disposable fluidic vessel (experiment in a bag) using two sheets of Polyacrylamide-Polyethylene channeling liquids via paths created with a laser-cutter. The system implementation includes a 2D magnetic peristaltic pump  a spectral sensor  and a heat transfer plate. MFB is an affordable  safe  and sterile system for hands-on experimentation with live microorganisms. Our system supports temperature control  liquid circulation  measurement of optical density  and a web interface for remote control and monitoring. Our first experiment demonstrates the three phases of bacterial growth: initial lag phase  the rapid-growth log phase  and the stationary phase.
LBW0118: Bricoleur: A Tool for Tinkering with Programmable Video and Audio,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sean Hickey  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,This paper presents Bricoleur  a new tool designed primarily for children to create rich dynamic audiovisual projects on mobile devices. Building off of technology developed for the Scratch programming language  Bricoleur allows users to capture video and audio media  then use visual programming blocks to quickly construct complex  interactive  and multilayered projects. The programmability of video and audio assets enables new creative possibilities that do not exist in traditional timeline-based video editing software nor in existing programming platforms. Drawing from Seymour Papert's assertion that all learning is an act of bricolage — i.e.  a process of constructing knowledge while dialoguing back and forth with creative materials — we describe the design of an initial prototype of Bricoleur  which emphasizes tinkerability as a primary design goal.
LBW0121: Using Video-based Technology in Powerlifting Sport to Support Referees' Decision Making,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Nick Michalopoulos  University of Patras Christina Katsini  Human Opsis George E. Raptis  Human Opsis,Referees' decisions in sport games  which must be made in less than a second  have an impact on the games' outcome. The use of hardware and/or software solutions could contribute towards increased accuracy of referees' decisions. Application of such solutions can be expensive  especially in the case of less popular sports. In this respect  we propose and evaluate a video-based system for helping referees in powerlifting to make better decisions. Results reveal promising accuracy rates of the proposed system. This attempt is the first step towards supporting referees in the powerlifting domain and further elaboration of the proposed system is required to achieve higher decision-making accuracy.
LBW0122: Detecting Demographic Bias in Automatically Generated Personas,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Joni Salminen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University & Turku School of Economics Soon-Gyo Jung  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Bernard J. Jansen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University,We investigate the existence of demographic bias in automatically generated personas by producing personas from YouTube Analytics data. Despite the intended objectivity of the methodology  we find elements of bias in the data-driven personas. The bias is highest when doing an exact match comparison  and the bias decreases when comparing at age or gender level. The bias also decreases when increasing the number of generated personas. For example  the smaller number of personas resulted in underrepresentation of female personas. This suggests that a higher number of personas gives a more balanced representation of the user population and a smaller number increases biases. Researchers and practitioners developing data-driven personas should consider the possibility of algorithmic bias  even unintentional  in their personas by comparing the personas against the underlying raw data.
LBW0123: Different Specialties  Different Gaze Strategies: Eye Tracking Opportunities in Seismic Interpretation Context,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Vagner Figueredo de Santana  IBM Research Rogerio Abreu de Paula  IBM Research Juliana Jansen Ferreira  IBM Research Renato Cerqueira  IBM Research Dario Sergio Cersósimo  Galp Energia Marco Ferraz  Galp Energia Joana Almeida  Galp Energia,Identifying how geoscientists interact with seismic images allows a deeper understanding of their rationale and the seismic interpretation process itself. Moreover  identifying nuances involving seismic interpreters performing slightly different roles opens new possibilities relative to how decision support systems could become part of the seismic interpretation. In this work  we detail an eye tracking study involving 11 seismic interpreters interacting with two seismic images. The results show that seismic interpreters  with different specialties  interact with seismic images differently. From the results  it is possible to better characterize gaze strategies from different seismic interpreters  which could also be used as input information for decision support systems.
LBW0124: HasAnswers: Development of a Digital Tool to Support Young People to Manage Independent Living,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Andrea Taylor  The Glasgow School of Art Isobel Grigor  Calman Trust Ainya Taylor  Calman Trust Ian Moore  Calman Trust,Many young people experience difficulty finding and keeping their first independent home  which can lead to homelessness or risk of homelessness. To help address this challenge  a young people's service in Scotland (Calman Trust) is developing a digital tool called HasAnswers. This paper provides a brief description of HasAnswers  the results of iterative testing with 69 young people (40 male  29 female) using paper and digital prototypes  and feedback from other services with a responsibility for supporting young people to achieve an independent adulthood  as a potential customer base for the future scaling up of HasAnswers to new geographical locations and organizations. While preliminary  the results/feedback has been consistently to confirm the potential usefulness and acceptability of HasAnswers. Next steps include applying the results of the latest user testing followed by pilot testing. The research contributes to the body of work within HCI on design for homelessness by providing a new digital tool with a greater emphasis on prevention and early intervention  informed by an iterative user-centred design process.
LBW0125: Understanding Turkish NGOs' Digital Technology Use in Helping Refugees in Turkey,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Bilgen Turkay  Ankara University Selen Turkay  Queensland University of Technology,According to the UN Refugee Agency  there are about 22 million people considered refugees around the world. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011 alone  approximately 11 million Syrians left their homes and sought refuge in other counties  mostly nearby countries such as Lebanon and Turkey. There are more than 3.7 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have a critical role in refugees' lives  their access to services  and integration into communities. In this study  we investigated the barriers NGOs encounter in their work with refugees and the types of information communication technologies they use in the process. Semi-structured interviews with participants from eight Turkish NGOs revealed that digital technologies have a fundamental role in their activities. They use them in three main ways including as tools to help them become knowledge brokers between Turkish communities and refugee communities. Our findings provide insights on NGOs' digital technology use and pave a path for future studies.
LBW0126: Engaging Pedestrians in Designing Interactions with Autonomous Vehicles,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Himanshu Verma  University of Fribourg & University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland Florian Evéquoz  University of Fribourg & University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland Guillaume Pythoud  University of Fribourg Grace Eden  Manchester Metropolitan University Denis Lalanne  University of Fribourg,Driverless Passenger Shuttles are operating as a public transport alternative in the town of Sion  Switzerland since June'16  and traversing the populated commercial and residential zones of the city center. The absence of a human driver and the lack of dedicated AV-pedestrian interface makes it challenging for road users (pedestrians  cyclists  etc.) to understand the intent or operational state of the vehicle and negotiate road usage. In this article  we present a co-design study aimed at informing the design of interactive communication means between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Conducted in two stages with the local community --which is accustomed to the AV's ecosystem and has interacted with it on a daily basis-- the study highlights the interactive experiences of road users  and furnishes contextualized design guidelines to bridge the communication with the pedestrians.
LBW0127: Relevance by Play: An Integrated Framework for Designing Museum Experiences,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Arnold P.O.S. Vermeeren  Delft University of Technology Licia Calvi  Breda University of Applied Sciences,The notion of relevance is often used as a concept to be considered for making a museum matter to its visitors. The term  however  is rarely operationalized for use by designers  practitioners  or scientists in their work on museum experiences. We propose an integrated framework for designing relevant museum experiences  in which we distinguish between four stages of seeding and growing relevance in new audiences  called "trigger"  "engage"  "consolidate" and "relate". The framework proposes to see designing for relevance as developing ways of integrating meaning-making  play and acceptable visitor effort across all these stages. It is intended to provide sensitizing concepts for use in further research on designing for relevance  as well as in design-related activities such as crafting requirements for new museum experiences  analyzing existing museum experiences and developing new museum experiences.
LBW0128: Immersive Process Models,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,André Zenner  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Sören Klingner  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus David Liebemann  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Akhmajon Makhsadov  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Antonio Krüger  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus,In many domains  real-world processes are traditionally communicated to users through abstract graph-based models like event-driven process chains (EPCs)  i.e. 2D representations on paper or desktop monitors. We propose an alternative interface to explore EPCs  called immersive process models  which aims to transform the exploration of EPCs into a multisensory virtual reality journey. To make EPC exploration more enjoyable  interactive and memorable  we propose a concept that spatializes EPCs by mapping traditional 2D graphs to 3D virtual environments. EPC graph nodes are represented by room-scale floating platforms and explored by users through natural walking. Our concept additionally enables users to experience important node types and the information flow through passive haptic interactions. Complementarily  gamification aspects aim to support the communication of logical dependencies within explored processes. This paper presents the concept of immersive process models and discusses future research directions.
LBW0129: Towards Empathetic Car Interfaces: Emotional Triggers while Driving,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sebastian Zepf  Daimler AG & Ulm University Monique Dittrich  Daimler AG & Julius-Maximilians University Javier Hernandez  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Alexander Schmitt  Daimler AG,Monitoring the emotions of drivers can play a critical role to reduce road accidents and enable novel driver-car interactions. To help understand the possibilities  this work systematically studies the in-road triggers that may lead to different emotional states. In particular  we monitored the experience of 33 drivers during 50 minutes of naturalistic driving each. With a total of 531 voice self-reports  we identified four main groups of emotional triggers based on their originating source  being those related to human-machine interaction and navigation the ones that more commonly elicited negative emotions. Based on the findings  this work provides some recommendations for potential future emotion-enabled interventions.
LBW0131: Public Engagement with Official-Source Content in Crisis,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tristin Glunt  University of New Mexico Marina Kogan  University of New Mexico,Authoritative online information is especially important in disaster  when social media users are seeking out time- and safety-critical information. In this work we investigate how people engage with the posts by authoritative accounts that fall into five social roles—politicians  government agencies  media  weather experts  and humanitarian organizations. More specifically  we explore whether in their disaster-time sensemaking activities social media users engage with the content from different types of authoritative sources differently  and why. We find that tweets by politicians garner most replies and shares  but not due to prevalence in them of tweet features that facilitate visibility and engagement—hashtags  URLs  and images. We find that while higher popularity of political accounts plays a role in higher engagement  it does not fully explain the differences. Preliminary qualitative analysis suggests that politicized event-related posts by politicians and politicized public response to their even innocuous tweets may affect engagement.
LBW0132: Machine-Crowd-Expert Model for Increasing User Engagement and Annotation Quality,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ana Elisa Méndez Méndez  New York University Mark Cartwright  New York University Juan Pablo Bello  New York University,Crowdsourcing and active learning have been combined in the past with the goal of reducing annotation costs. However  two issues arise with using AL and crowdsourcing: quality of the labels and user engagement. In this work  we propose a novel machine crowd expert loop model where the forward connections of the loop aim to improve the quality of the labels and the backward connections aim to increase user engagement. In addition  we propose a research agenda for evaluating the model.
LBW0133: Step-by-Step: Exploring a Social Exergame to Encourage Physical Activity and Social Dynamics among Office Workers,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xipei Ren  Eindhoven University of Technology Lotte Hollander  Eindhoven University of Technology Rylana van der Marel  Eindhoven University of Technology Lieke Molenaar  Eindhoven University of Technology Yuan Lu  University of Technology Eindhoven,This paper presents an exploratory study of a social exergame  called Step-by-Step  to help office workers initiate physical movements and social interactions in the work routine. In this project  we developed a mobile system for exploring a new mechanism of office vitality  through which the fitness task can be relayed from one to another co-worker in a workplace. Based on our prototypes  we evaluated the feasibility of Step-by-Step through a user study with five office workers and an expert interview with three senior designers. We discuss implications for the future development of the Step-by-Step system based on our qualitative findings.
LBW0134: Ways Into the Design Space of Butterflies in the Stomach,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Andreas Almqvist  Royal Institute of Technology,This work presents ways into a design space of butterflies in the stomach; a qualia of belly tingling sensation possible of pleasure  discomfort and presence heightening. Three design instances are presented. From and within those are three conceptual directions drawn and exemplified. Conditional availability involves tuning the availability of an interaction to certain geographic locations  environmental conditions and time-of-day in strive for particular aesthetics. Erratic and dubious presence is about making interactions unpredictable and/or feeding a doubt whether the user is engaged in an interaction or not  in strive for confusion and startle. Sensorial evidence of interaction is a way of thinking about narratives within an interaction through elements of planning  exploration and suddenness in strive for experiential qualities like anticipation  surprise  and fascination of discovery. My felt experiences of a two-day camping trip were used as a design resource. Reflections of these experiences were used in the design and concept development through visualizations  textual narratives  technical implementation detailing  and thematic analysis. This work is a provocative step expanding on what human-computer interaction can be in the outdoors.
LBW0135: Idea Bits: A Tangible Design Tool to Aid Idea Generation for Tangible Manipulation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Uddipana Baishya  Simon Fraser University Alissa N. Antle  Simon Fraser University Elgin-Skye McLaren  Simon Fraser University,Tangible interaction design students often find it difficult to generate ideas for tangible manipulation. They often restrict their explorations to a few familiar possibilities. To our knowledge  there is no design tool that focuses on facilitating the exploration of a variety of manipulation and aiding generation of ideas for manipulation. To address this gap  we designed Idea Bits  a tangible design tool consisting of interactive physical artifacts that enable users to experience a set of manipulations. These artifacts are coupled with digital examples of tangible systems and technical implementation guidance to help users understand how to implement the manipulations. Our work contributes knowledge about the generation of ideas for manipulation and will be useful to tangible interaction design students  instructors  practitioners  and researchers.
LBW0136: Stimulight: Exploring Social Interaction to Reduce Physical Inactivity among Office Workers,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hans Brombacher  Eindhoven University of Technology Dennis Arts  Fontys University of Applied Sciences & Eindhoven University of Technology Carl Megens  Eindhoven University of Technology Steven Vos  Fontys University of Applied Sciences & Eindhoven University of Technology,Prolonged sitting at the workplace is a growing public health concern. In this paper  we propose the activity-focused design framework which provides an overview of recent work in HCI to stimulate physcial activity or to reduce sedentary behavior. Next  based on this framework  we present Stimulight  an intelligent system designed to explore the effect of providing personal and/or social feedback on the activity pattern of office workers. To test the intuitiveness of the feedback modalities of our design  three different feedback conditions were explored in a lab study with 61 participants. Our results show a positive effect of visualizing and sharing physical activity patterns with co-workers. Based on our findings  we present design implications and offer perspectives for future work on how to use social feedback mechanisms to encourage social interaction in the workplace to enhance physically active behavior among office workers.
LBW0137: Your Period Rules: Design Implications for Period-Positive Technologies,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Nadia Campo Woytuk  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Linette Nilsson  KTH Royal institute of Technology Mingxing Liu  KTH Royal Institute of Technology,In this work  we address the challenges of designing interactive technologies that approach menstruation in a positive way. Building on a Research through Design approach  we underline the tensions emerging from first-hand experiences and reflections in a design workshop. In order to maintain a positive approach  rather than asking participants what problems they encountered while on their period  we asked them what desires they had  and what experiences might help them cope with it. The results of the workshop emphasized the need for reflecting critically on how we perceive menstruation when designing and how viewing menstruation as a problem might perpetuate taboos and distance women's experiences from their bodies. We aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion on designing for women's health in HCI by suggesting implications for researchers and practitioners.
LBW0138: Call Me by My Name: Exploring Roles of Sci-fi Voice Agents,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yu-Ting Cheng  National Taiwan University of Science and Technology & Eindhoven University of Technology Guo-Ling Tsai  National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Heng-An Lin  National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Yi-Ching Huang  Eindhoven University of Technology Rung-Huei Liang  National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Lin-Lin Chen  Eindhoven University of Technology,Voice Conversational Agents (VCAs) are increasingly becoming part of our daily life. Calling them by their names can solve more than just a problem of efficiency in interaction between users and VCAs  but also can cast them as actors capable of playing a role in a relationship. However  due to the immature state of the technology and its related services  such relationships between users and VCAs can be limited in practice. To broaden the scope in designing different relationships  this study explores VCAs depicted in sci-fi movies. Sci-fi is not purely based on fantasy  but also is a social reflection on technology  which in turn can inspire design researchers to understand and speculate the complexity of VCAs. Through community sourcing with sci-fi enthusiasts  43 Sci-fi VCAs were deduced. A movie event was also organized to discuss the role of VCAs. Finally  this paper presents several possible design insights for designing the role of VCAs.

Common solutions include white canes and guide dogs. White canes are useful in object detection  but require physically touching objects with the cane  which may be undesired. Guide dogs allow navigation without touching objects in the vicinity  but cannot help in object detection. By addressing this gap  employing a user-centric research approach  we aim to find a solution to improve the independence of VI people. Here  we began by initially gathering requirements through online questionnaires. Working from this  we build a prototype of a glove that alerts its users when an obstacle is detected at the pointed position; we call this EyeR. Lastly  we evaluated EyeR with VI users and found out that in use our prototype provides real time feedback and is helpful in navigation. We also provide future recommendations for VI prototypes from our participants  who would additionally like the device to recognise objects.

Our goal is to establish user-experience design as a paradigm in basic neuroscientific research to overcome the limits of current studies  especially in rare neurological disorders.The presented application guides users through the fitting procedure of the EEG headset and automatically encrypts and uploads recorded data to a remote server. User-feedback and neurophysiological data from a pilot study with eighteen subjects indicate that the application can be used outside of a laboratory  without the need for external guidance. We hope to inspire future work on the intersection between basic neuroscience and human-computer interaction as a promising paradigm to accelerate research on rare neurological diseases and assistive neurotechnology.

Specifically  many video streaming technologies require input devices and content browsers that are inaccessible to individuals with sensory and physical impairments and do not work with their current assistive technologies. Our team of engineers  designers  and clinicians took an inclusive approach to assessing and redesigning these streaming service products  with the aim of creating more universally accessible experiences. We recruited 9 participants with diverse abilities to evaluate the accessibility of a large telecommunication company's commercially available video streaming products. This evaluation revealed significant accessibility barriers and informed the design of a participatory design activity to create accessible remote-controls  an onboarding assistance prototype  and a content browsing prototype that is screen reader accessible and supports audio descriptions. We evaluated these accessible prototypes with 11 additional participants and found they were more accessible  flexible  and enjoyable to use compared to the off-the shelf products. In this paper we summarize these findings and discuss how future streaming technology must support customization and follow established accessibility guidelines and standards.
LBW0185: Development and Initial Validation of a Scale to Measure Engagement with eHealth Technologies,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Saskia M. Kelders  University of Twente & North-West University Hanneke Kip  University of Twente,In eHealth  engagement is viewed as an important factor in explaining why interventions are beneficial to some and not to others. However  a shared understanding of what engagement is and how to measure it  is missing. This paper presents the set-up of the development and initial validation of a new scale to measure engagement with eHealth interventions  based on scientific literature and interviews with users and experts. Furthermore  it presents the preliminary results of a systematic review  11 interviews with engaged users and the first version of the new engagement scale. It is expected that the final scale  which will be based on theoretical and empirical research and focus on the different components of engagement  will enable researchers to investigate what features and forms of technology influence individuals' engagement and thereby pave the way to create more engaging technologies.

Given that fashion is a means of self-expression  their independency of expressing themselves has been limited. In this work  we sought to provide technological solutions for visually impaired people  to help them distinguish the color of clothes while shopping. After conducting exploratory user studies  we derived design requirements and developed a voice service mobile application which guides them through recognizing and choosing colors of clothing.

To research the aspect of older adults' interaction with voice user interfaces (VUI) we organized two workshops and gathered insights concerning possible benefits and barriers to the use of VA combined with SHT by older adults. Apart from evaluating the participants' interaction with the devices during the two workshops we also discuss some improvements to the VA interaction paradigm.
LBW0188: AUFLIP - An Auditory Feedback System Towards Implicit Learning of Advanced Motor Skills,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Daniel Levine  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Alan Cheng  Massachusetts Institute of Technology David Olaleye  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Kevin Leonardo  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Matthew Shifrin  New England Conservatory of Music Hiroshi Ishii  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,How can people learn advanced motor skills such as front flips and tennis swings without starting from a young age? The answer  following the work of Masters et. al.  we believe  is implicitly. Implicit learning is associated with higher retention and knowledge transfer  but that is unable to be explicitly articulated as a set of rules. To achieve implicit learning is difficult  but may be taught using obscured feedback - that is feedback that provides little enough information such that a user does not overfit a mental model of their target action. We have designed an auditory feedback system - AUFLIP - that describes high level properties of an advanced movement using a simplified and validated physics model of the flip. We further detail the implementation of a wearable system  optimized placement procedure  and takeoff capture strategy to realize this model. With an audio cue pattern that conveys this high-level  obscured objective  the system is integrated into a gymnastics-training environment with professional coaches teaching novice adults how to perform front flips. We perform a pilot user study training front flips  evaluating using a matched-pair comparison.
LBW0189: DryNights : a Self-powered Bedwetting Alarm for Children,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Daan Matthijsse  Eindhoven University of Technology,This extended abstract describes the concept of DryNights  a bedwetting behaviour change support system concept consisting out of a self-powered sensor and a mobile application developed in collaboration with LifeSense Group (spinoff Imec  Holst Centre) and the Eindhoven University of Technology. The sensor uses the principle of an electrochemical cell to generate its own electricity and to power a harmless and wireless signal transmission from the sensor to a mobile device. The mobile application has been designed in collaboration with children (N=75) from the target group. The reliability of the signal transmission and the range of the sensor have been successfully evaluated in a small scale experiment. Trials with children wearing it to go to sleep are currently under way  and suggest that DryNights is comfortable and children are experiencing it positively.
LBW0263: Picture Passwords in Mixed Reality: Implementation and Evaluation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,George Hadjidemetriou  University of Cyprus Marios Belk  University of Central Lancashire  Cyprus Campus Christos Fidas  University of Patras Andreas Pitsillides  University of Cyprus,We present HoloPass  a mixed reality application for the HoloLens wearable device  which allows users to perform user authentication tasks through gesture-based interaction. In particular  this paper reports the implementation of picture passwords for mixed reality environments  and highlights the development procedure  lessons learned from common design and development issues  and how they were addressed. It further reports a between-subjects study (N=30) which compared usability  security  and likeability aspects of picture passwords in mixed reality vs. traditional desktop contexts aiming to investigate and reason on the viability of picture passwords as an alternative user authentication approach for mixed reality. This work can be of value for enhancing and driving future implementations of picture passwords in mixed reality since initial results are promising towards following such a research line.
LBW1110: Hands-On Math: A Training System for Children with Dyscalculia,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Georg Erfurt  Bauhaus-Universität Weimar Eva Hornecker  Bauhaus-Universität Weimar Jan Ehlers  University of Weimar Silke Plaschkies  IPF Institut für pädagogische Förderung,Dyscalculia affects comprehension of numerical mathematical problems  working with numbers and arithmetics. We describe our work on a training system for an exercise that trains connections between verbal and numerical representations of numbers and finger counting. Fingers support embodied cognition and constitute a natural numerical representation. We describe the design rationale and iterative development process  and first evaluation results for our system that enables children to train without guidance and feedback by a trainer.
LBW1111: Informal STEAM Education Case Study: Child-Robot Musical Theater,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jaclyn Barnes  Michigan Technological University S. Maryam FakhrHosseini  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Eric Vasey  Michigan Technological University Chung Hyuk Park  George Washington University Myounghoon Jeon  Virginia Tech,STEAM education fuses arts with traditional STEM fields so that the diverse disciplines can broaden and inform each other. Our eight-week STEAM after school program exposed elementary school children to social robotics and musical theater. Approximately 25 children grades K-5 participated over the course of the program with an average of 12 children attending each week. The program covered acting  dancing  music  and drawing with the robots in two-week modules based around the fairy tale  "Beauty and the Beast". The modular design enabled children who could come to only a few sessions to participate actively. The children demonstrated enthusiasm for both the robots and the musical theater activities and were engaged in the program. Efforts such as this can provide meaningful opportunities for children to explore a variety of arts and STEM fields in an enjoyable manner. The program components and lessons learned are discussed with recommendations for future research.
LBW1112: SolveDeep: A System for Supporting Subgoal Learning in Online Math Problem Solving,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hyoungwook Jin  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Minsuk Chang  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Juho Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,Learner-driven subgoal labeling helps learners form a hierarchical structure of solutions with subgoals  which are conceptual units of procedural problem solving. While learning with such hierarchical structure of a solution in mind is effective in learning problem solving strategies  the development of an interactive feedback system to support subgoal labeling tasks at scale requires significant expert efforts  making learner-driven subgoal labeling difficult to be applied in online learning environments. We propose SolveDeep  a system that provides feedback on learner solutions with peer-generated subgoals. SolveDeep utilizes a learnersourcing workflow to generate the hierarchical representation of possible solutions  and uses a graph-alignment algorithm to generate a solution graph by merging the populated solution structures  which are then used to generate feedback on future learners' solutions. We conducted a user study with 7 participants to evaluate the efficacy of our system. Participants did subgoal learning with two math problems and rated the usefulness of system feedback. The average rating was 4.86 out of 7 (1: Not useful  7: Useful)  and the system could successfully construct a hierarchical structure of solutions with learnersourced subgoal labels.
LBW1113: Land.Info: Interactive 3D Visualization for Public Space Design Ideation in Neighborhood Planning,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Saebom Kwon  University of Michigan Mark Lindquist  University of Michigan Shannon Sylte  University of Michigan Gwen Gell  University of Michigan Ayush Awadhiya  University of Michigan Kidus Ayalneh Admassu  University of Michigan,In the contemporary practice of participatory neighborhood planning  planners leverage digital support tools with realistic  interactive 3D visualization to support perception processing and to increase engagement among diverse public stakeholders. However  capturing the aspirations of a community lacking design and planning expertise requires a more thorough evaluation and considered design of support tools. We present Land.Info  a proof-of-concept software that allows users to design open spaces with 3D visualization and see the subsequent costs and environmental consequences. To assess how the public engages in design discussion with 3D visualization  we organized three community design workshops for developing a vacant lot. We found that 3D visualization 1) promotes public ideation of user stories around objects  and 2) prohibits ideas beyond spatial design elements. Future research will investigate whether it is possible to aggregate more diverse public aspirations  whether or not visual realism sets expectations for designs  and the potential impacts of expanding the software user base for neighborhood planning cases.
LBW1114: SociaBowl: A Dynamic Table Centerpiece to Mediate Group Conversations,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Joanne Leong  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Yuehan Wang  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Romy Sayah  Harvard University Stella Rossikopoulou Pappa  Harvard University Florian Perteneder  University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria Hiroshi Ishii  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,In this paper  we introduce SociaBowl  a dynamic table centerpiece to promote positive social dynamics in 2-way cooperative conversations. A centerpiece such as a bowl of food  a decorative flower arrangement  or a container of writing tools  is commonly placed on a table around which people have conversations. We explore the design space for an augmented table and centerpiece to influence how people may interact with one another. We present an initial functional prototype to explore different choices in materiality of feedback  interaction styles  and animation and motion patterns. These aspects are discussed with respect to how it may impact people's awareness of their turn taking dynamics as well as provide an additional channel for expression. Potential enhancements for future iterations in its design are then outlined based on these findings.
LBW1115: Embodying Historical Learners' Messages as Learning Companions in a VR Classroom,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Meng-Yun Liao  National Chiao Tung University Ching-Ying Sung  National Taiwan University Hao-Chuan Wang  University of California  Davis Wen-Chieh Lin  National Chiao Tung University Fu-Yin Cherng  National Chiao Tung University,Online learning platforms such as MOOCs have been prevalent sources of self-paced learning to people nowadays. However  the lack of peer accompaniment and social interaction may increase learners' sense of isolation. Prior studies have shown the positive effects on visualizing peer students' appearances in VR learning environments. In this work  we propose to build virtual classmates  which were constructed by synthesizing previous learners' time-anchored messages. Configurations of virtual classmates and their behavioral features can be adjusted. To build the characteristics of virtual classmates  we developed a technique called comment mapping to aggregate prior online learners' comments to shape virtual classmates' behaviors. We evaluated the effects of the virtual classmates built with and without the comment mapping and the amount of virtual classmates rendered in VR.
LBW1116: NoteStruct: Scaffolding Note-taking while Learning from Online Videos,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ching (Jean) Liu  National Tsing Hua University Chi-Lan Yang  National Taiwan University Joseph Jay Williams  University of Toronto Hao-Chuan Wang  University of California  Davis,Note-taking activities in physical classrooms are ubiquitous and have been emerging in online learning. To investigate how to better support online learners to take notes while learning with videos  we compared free-form note-taking with a prototype system  NoteStruct  which prompts learners to perform a series of note-taking activities. NoteStruct enables learners to insert annotations on transcripts of video lectures and then engages learners in reinterpreting and synthesizing their notes after watching a video. In a study with a sample of Mechanical Turk workers (N=80)  learners took longer and more extensive notes with NoteStruct  although using NoteStruct versus free-form note-taking did not impact short-term learning outcome. These longer notes were also less likely to include verbatim copied video transcripts  but more likely to include elaboration and interpretation. We demonstrate how NoteStruct influences note-taking during online video learning.
LBW1117: DetourNavigator - Using Google Location History to Generate Unfamiliar Personal Routes,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Markus Löchtefeld  Aalborg University,With the ubiquity of turn-by-turn navigation on toady's smartphones  personal exploration of the unseen has been drastically diminished. Such services make it less likely for users to conquer their less frequented parts of the urban environment. In this paper we present the DetourNavigator  a navigation service that creates routes based on Google Location History along areas that are unfamiliar to the user. Our preliminary user study indicates that these personalized graphs are well suited to generate routes that might lead to more holistic knowledge about the built environment.
LBW1118: An Energy Lifestyles Program for Tweens: A Pilot Study,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Matthew Louis Mauriello  Stanford University & Oregon State University Chad Zanocco  Oregon State University Gregory Stelmach  Oregon State University June Flora  Stanford University Hilary Boudet  Oregon State University Ram Rajagopal  Stanford University,Prior work has demonstrated that energy education programs designed for young children can influence the adoption of energy efficiency measures in the home. Here  we introduce the Know Your Energy Numbers (KYEN) program  an energy education program designed to teach an older audience of pre-teens  or tweens  about: (i) their energy consumption lifestyles  (ii) available residential energy tools  and (iii) methods to extract insights from their energy data. We also describe results from two pilots with 18 tweens from Girl Scout and Boy Scout troops living in Northern California. We report on how participants and their families reacted to our energy-based curricula  the benefits and challenges they perceived about using energy tools  and their preferences regarding the display of home energy data. We conclude with a brief discussion of the outcomes and limitations of this work before describing next steps for the program.
LBW1119: P300-Based 3D Brain Painting in Virtual Reality,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Willie McClinton  University of South Florida Derek Caprio  University of South Florida Denis Laesker  University of South Florida Blanche Pinto  University of South Florida Sarah Garcia  University of South Florida Marvin Andujar  University of South Florida,Brain Painting is a brain-computer interface (BCI) application that gives users the ability to paint on a virtual canvas without requiring physical movement [1-2]. Brain Painting has shown to improve the Quality of Life (QOL) of patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  by giving patients a way to express themselves and affect society through their art [1]. Although there is currently no known cure for ALS  through such outlets we can help mitigate the physical and psychological impairments of those living with ALS. This paper discusses the development and testing of an immersive Brain Painting application using a Google brush-like tool in a 3D Environment  for able-bodied users. It also discusses how it can help provide a more immersive medium for users to express themselves creatively. In addition  we also discuss feedback received from a preliminary study on how the brush and application can be improved to better allow users to paint in VR using their brain.
LBW1120: Persuading the Driver: A Literature Review to Identify Blind Spots,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Irina Paraschivoiu  University of Salzburg Alexander Meschtscherjakov  University of Salzburg Manfred Tscheligi  University of Salzburg & AIT,We present a review of persuasive systems in vehicles based on the Persuasion Interface Design in the Automotive context Framework (PIDAF). It integrates intents  cues  persuasive principles and design options for automotive persuasion. Our results show that most systems target safety and eco-driving using conscious cues to alert the driver. Most systems use self-monitoring  tailoring or suggestion as persuasive principles. Visual modalities are still much more popular than auditory or haptic ones. We identified blind spots to support designers and researchers in developing systems addressing areas which are less explored in automotive persuasion.
LBW1121: Analysis of Previsualization Tasks for Animation  Film and Theater,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Thomas Muender  University of Bremen Georg Volkmar  University of Bremen Dirk Wenig  University of Bremen Rainer Malaka  University of Bremen,Previsualization (previs) is an essential phase in the visual design process of narrative media such as film  animation  and stage plays. In digital previs complex 3D tools are used that are not specifically designed for the previs process making it hard to use for creative persons without much technical knowledge. To enable building dedicated previs software  we analyze the tasks performed in digital previs based on interviews with domain experts. In order to support creative persons in their previs work we propose the use of natural user interfaces and discuss which are suited for the specific previs tasks.
LBW1122: Youth Concerns and Responses to Self-Tracking Tools and Personal Informatics Systems,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Kyrill Potapov  University College London Victor R. Lee  Utah State University Asimina Vasalou  University College London Paul Marshall  University of Bristol,Though some work has looked at the implementation of personal informatics tools with youth and in schools  the approach has been prescriptive; students are pushed toward behaviour change intervention or otherwise use the data for prescribed learning in a particular curriculum area. This has left a gap around how young people may themselves choose to use personal informatics tools in ways relevant to their own concerns. We gave workshops on personal informatics to 13 adolescents at two secondary schools in London  UK. We asked them to use a commercial personal informatics app to track something they chose that they thought might impact their learning. Our participants proved competent and versatile users of personal informatics tools. They tracked their feelings  tech activity  physical activity  and sleep with many using the process as a system for understanding and validating aspects of their own lives  rather than changing them.
LBW1210: Guess or Not? A Brain-Computer Interface Using EEG Signals for Revealing the Secret behind Scores,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tao Xu  Northwestern Polytechnical University Yun Zhou  Shaanxi Normal University Yuhan Wang  Northwestern Polytechnical University Zichen Zhao  Northwestern Polytechnical University Shiqian Li  Shaanxi Normal University,Now examinations and scores serve as the main criterion for a student's academic performance. However  students use guessing strategies to improve the chances of choosing the right answer in a test. Therefore  scores do not reflect actual levels of the student's knowledge and skills. In this paper  we propose a brain-computer interface (BCI) to estimate whether a student guesses on a test question or masters it when s/he chooses the right answer in logic reasoning. To build this BCI  we first define the "Guessing'' and employ Raven's Progressive Matrices as logic tests in the experiment to collect EEG signals  then we propose a sliding time-window with quorum-based voting (STQV) approach to recognize the state of "Guessing'' or "Understanding''  together with FBCSP and end-to-end ConvNet classification algorithms. Results show that this BCI yields an accuracy of 83.71% and achieves a good performance in distinguishing "Guessing'' from "Understanding''.
LBW1211: Cross-platform Interactions and Popularity in the Live-streaming Community,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lauren Arnett  Columbia University Robert Netzorg  Columbia University Augustin Chaintreau  Columbia University Eugene Wu  Columbia University,Twitch  a live video-streaming platform  provides strong financial and social incentives to developing a follower base. While streamers benefit from Twitch's own features for forming a wide community of engaged viewers  many streamers look to external social media platforms to increase their reach and build their following. We collect a corpus of Twitch streamer popularity measures and their behavior data on Twitch and third party platforms. We test the community-proposed relationship between behavior on social media accounts and popularity through examining the timing of creation and use of social media accounts. We conduct these experiments by studying the correlations between streamer behaviors and two popularity measures used by Twitch: followers and average concurrent viewers. We find that we cannot yet define which behaviors have statistically significant correlations with popularity  and propose future directions for this research.
LBW1212: Inferring User Engagement from Interaction Data,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jonathan Carlton  The University of Manchester & BBC Research and Development Andy Brown  BBC Research and Development Caroline Jay  The University of Manchester John Keane  The University of Manchester,This paper presents preliminary results of a study designed to quantify users' engagement levels with interactive media content  through self-reported measures and interaction data. The broad hypothesis of the study is that interaction data can be used to predict the level of engagement felt by the user. The challenge addressed in this work is to explore the effectiveness of interaction data to act as a proxy for engagement levels and reveal what that data shows about engagement with media content. Preliminary results suggest several interesting insights about participants engagement and behaviour. Crucially  temporal statistics support the hypothesis that the participant making use of the controls in the interactive  video-based experience positively correlates with higher engagement.
LBW1213: Characterizing Homelessness Discourse on Social Media,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Andrea Hu  Georgia Tech Stevie Chancellor  Georgia Tech Munmun De Choudhury  Georgia Tech,Social media allows us to connect and maintain relationships in spite of physical distance and barriers; as computers and the internet become more accessible  hard-to-reach populations are finding a voice on these platforms. One such group is those who are or have been homeless. Through a computational linguistic analysis of a large corpus of Tumblr blog posts  this paper provides preliminary insights to understand the unique ways homeless bloggers express their needs  frustrations and financial/social distress  connect with others  and seek emotional and practical support from others. We highlight future investigations  building upon this research  that can be pursued in HCI to assist an underserved population with the difficult life experience of homelessness.
LBW1214: Finsta: Creating "Fake" Spaces for Authentic Performance,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sofia Dewar  University of California  Berkeley Schinria Islam  University of California  Berkeley Elizabeth Resor  University of California  Berkeley Niloufar Salehi  University of California  Berkeley,Finsta is a "fake'' Instagram account that some people maintain in addition to their real Instagram account (rinsta) for a more authentic performance. We draw on Goffman's theatrical metaphor and use a mixed-methods approach to explore how and why people do the work of performing their identity across these distinct presentations of the self. We found that finsta users deliberately partition their audience and mostly maintain a small audience of close friends to avoid context collapse. Additionally  we discovered that finsta is a space where distinct norms shape performance: humor  authenticity  and "unfiltered'' self-expression. Given that finsta users are mostly teenagers and young adults  we ask how an expectation for authentic performance by peers might itself increase pressure on users.
LBW1215: Availability and Boundary Management: An Exploratory Study,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Martina Schuß  University of Bamberg Tom Gross  University of Bamberg,As technology is becoming more powerful and widespread  it is used in multiple areas and for diverse purposes making us available to others anytime and anyplace. Boundary management focuses on the organisation of domains in life and their borders (e.g.  between work vs. non-work). Working parents of young children are facing particular challenges of orchestrating their life domains. We present the results of an interview study of parents of young children on their boundary management and availability across domains. The paper contributes an identification of life domains; a classification of availability statuses; and details on the status we call ad-hoc availability with a melange of a priori rules and spontaneous behaviours. Ad-hoc availability is not only determined by a general personal preference for connection  but very importantly by a practical information need from the parent towards the person wanting to connect.
LBW1216: Using a Conversational Agent to Facilitate Non-native Speaker's Active Participation in Conversation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Zixuan Guo  University of Tsukuba Tomoo Inoue  University of Tsukuba,When a non-native speaker talks with a native speaker  he/she sometimes feels hard to take speaking turns due to language proficiency. The resulting conversation between a non-native speaker and a native speaker is not always productive. In this paper  we propose a conversational agent to support a non-native speaker in his/her second language conversation. The agent joins the conversation and makes intervention by a simple script based on turn-taking rules for taking the agent's turn  and gives the next turn to the non-native speaker for prompting him/her to speak. Evaluation of the proposed agent suggested that it successfully facilitated the non-native speaker's participation over 30% of the agent's interventions  and significantly increased the frequency of turn-taking.
LBW1217: Worker Demographics and Earnings on Amazon Mechanical Turk: An Exploratory Analysis,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Kotaro Hara  Singapore Management University Abigail Adams  University of Oxford Kristy Milland  University of Toronto Saiph Savage  West Virginia University Benjamin V. Hanrahan  Pennsylvania State University Jeffrey P. Bigham  Carnegie Mellon University Chris Callison-Burch  University of Pennsylvania,Prior research reported that workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) are underpaid  earning about $2/h. But the prior research did not investigate the difference in wage due to worker characteristics (e.g.  country of residence). We present the first data-driven analysis on wage gap on AMT. Using work log data and demographic data collected via online survey  we analyse the gap in wage due to different factors. We show that there is indeed wage gap; for example  workers in the U.S. earn $3.01/h while those in India earn $1.41/h.
LBW1218: Alliance for My Idol: Analyzing the K-pop Fandom Collaboration Network,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jiwon Kang  Hanyang University Minsung Lee  Hanyang University Eunil Park  Sungkyunkwan University Minsam Ko  Hanyang University Munyoung Lee  ETRI Jinyoung Han  Hanyang University,As the K-pop industry has been rapidly expanded  the strength of the K-pop fandoms is under the spotlight. In particular  the collaborations among fandoms for mutually supporting their artists have contributed to the success of the K-pop artists. This paper investigates the current practice of the fandom collaborations in K-pop. To this end  we first introduce the notion of the 'fandom collaboration network' that represents the collaborations among K-pop fandoms. By collecting and analyzing a large-scale fandom activity data from DCinside  we investigate (i) to what extent fandom collaboration is prevalent in K-pop  (ii) how fandoms collaborate with other fandoms  and (iii) what fandoms play more roles in fandom collaboration than others. We find that K-pop fandoms actively collaborate with other fandoms for mutually supporting their artists. By analyzing the structural properties of the fandom collaboration network  we show the fandom collaboration is basically based on the reciprocity. However  we also show that the amount of collaborations between the two fandoms is often unfair. Among all the active fandoms in our data  we find that there a small number of fandoms who play significant roles in fandom collaborations in K-pop. We believe our work can provide important insight for K-pop stakeholders such as fans  agencies  artists  marketers  and broadcasting companies.
LBW1219: Lithopia: Prototyping Blockchain Futures,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Denisa Reshef Kera  University of Salamanca Petr Šourek  Corruptour Mateusz Kraiński  krainski.eu Yair Reshef  Shenkar College of Design and Engineering Juan Manuel Corchado Rodríguez  University of Salamanca Iva Magdalena Knoblochová  Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague,Lithopia is a prototype of a blockchain-managed fictional village that uses satellite and drone data to trigger smart contracts on the open source blockchain platform  Hyperledger. The project is testing the possibility of anticipatory governance of emerging blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) by involving stakeholders in the design process over templates. The goal is to question the promises of blockchain governance happening over automation and smart contracts and to offer an alternative to the misuses of emerging technologies in the so-called predictive and anticipatory design. The prototype consists of a functional Node-RED dashboard used as an interface for the Hyperledger smart contracts and a design fiction movie about the lives of the Lithopians.
LBW1220: Crowdsourcing Perspectives on Public Policy from Stakeholders,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hyunwoo Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Eun-Young Ko  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Donghoon Han  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Sung-Chul Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Simon T. Perrault  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology and Singapore University of Technology and Design Jihee Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Juho Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,Personal deliberation  the process through which people can form an informed opinion on social issues  serves an important role in helping citizens construct a rational argument in the public deliberation. However  existing information channels for public policies deliver only few stakeholders' voices  thus failing to provide a diverse knowledge base for personal deliberation. This paper presents an initial design of PolicyScape  an online system that supports personal deliberation on public policies by helping citizens explore diverse stakeholders and their perspectives on the policy's effect. Building on literature on crowdsourced policymaking and policy stakeholders  we present several design choices for crowdsourcing stakeholder perspectives. We introduce perspective-taking as an approach for personal deliberation by helping users consider stakeholder perspectives on policy issues. Our initial results suggest that PolicyScape could collect diverse sets of perspectives from the stakeholders of public policies  and help participants discover unexpected viewpoints of various stakeholder groups.
LBW1221: How "True Bitcoiners" Work on Reddit to Maintain Bitcoin,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Megan L. Knittel  Michigan State University Rick Wash  Michigan State University,After the meteoric rise in price  and subsequent public interest  of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin  a developing body of work has begun examining its impact on society. In recent months  as Bitcoin's price has rapidly declined  uncertainty and distrust have begun to overshadow early enthusiasm. In this late-breaking work  we investigated one of the largest and most important Bitcoin online communities  the r/Bitcoin Reddit forum. A vocal subgroup of users identify themselves as "true Bitcoiners"  and justify their continued devotion to Bitcoin. These subreddit participants explained and justified their trust in Bitcoin in three primary ways: identifying characteristics of beneficial versus harmful Bitcoin users  diminishing the importance of problems  and describing themselves as loyal to Bitcoin over time.
LBW1222: Evaluating a Wearable Camera's Social Acceptability In-the-Wild,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Marion Koelle  University of Oldenburg Torben Wallbaum  OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology Wilko Heuten  OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology Susanne Boll  University of Oldenburg,With increasing ubiquity  wearable technologies are becoming part of everyday life where they may cause controversy  discomfort and social tension. Particularly  body-worn "always-on" cameras raise social acceptability concerns as their form factors hinder bystanders to infer whether they are "in the frame". Screen-based status indicators have been suggested as remedy  but not evaluated in-the-wild. Simultaneously  best practices for evaluating social acceptability in field studies are rare. This work contributes to closing both gaps. First  we contribute results of an in-the-wild evaluation of a screen-based status indicator testing the suitability of the "displayed camera image" design strategy. Second  we discuss methodical implications for evaluating social acceptability in the field  and cover lessons learned from collecting hypersubjective self-reports. We provide a self-critical  in-depth discussion of our field experiment  including study-related behavior patterns  and prototype fidelity. Our work may serve as a reference for field studies evaluating social acceptability.
LBW1310: Morphing Design for Socially Interactive Autonomous Car by Multi-Material 3D-Printing,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Soya Eguchi  Keio University Ryoma Takamori  Keio University Ryohei Yuasa  Keio University Hiroya Tanaka  Keio University,An autonomous car  also known as a robot car  self-driving car  is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving with little or no human control. In most cases today  a driver can switch "driving mode" of his/her car between manual and autonomous. However  while the mode can be smartly changed  it is not able to show the current driving mode to nearby pedestrians. This might become a source of anxieties for many ordinary people living in the era of autonomous car. To overcome this issue  we propose to create a car with new expressive functions  and make it communicable and interactive. Unlike conventional approaches which use displays and LEDs  our approach is to develop 3D shape-transforming  morphable body of a car by using multi-material 3D-printing. Our first trial with printed soft membranes was successful in representing three different modes of a car seamlessly. In this paper  we introduce our concept  core technologies and implementations  and discuss further possibilities and future works.
LBW1311: Social Microbial Prosthesis: Towards Super-Organism Centered Design,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Karen El Asmar  The New School,In this paper  I speculate on a future where our need to socialize physically is solely to exchange bacteria. With our biological data being in the hands of private companies and governments and our environments' microbiomes becoming less diverse  our social systems  social identities and social interactions are redefined and reinvented to adapt to this new reality. In this world  everyone wears a "social microbial prosthesis" that analyzes their microbial composition from their breath and reveals sensitive information on their chest. The microbial prosthesis would be able to give off information not only on the microbial composition but also on the mental and physical health of a person. This second skin plays a role in controlling communication and interaction between people  where one is able to  by inspecting surrounding people's prosthesis  take careful considerations of who to interact with and who to avoid. Social Microbial Prosthesis is a critique of the race of private companies and governments to collect our biological data  the role of commercializing such data in shaping and changing our social identities and a response to the loss of microbial diversity in our environments due to our modern lifestyles and surroundings.
LBW1312: Howel: A Soft Wearable with Dynamic Textile Patterns as an Ambient Display for Cardio Training,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Çağlar Genç  Koç University Yavuz Ali Ekmekçioğlu  Koç University Fuat Balci  Koç University Hakan Ürey  Koç University Oğuzhan Özcan  Koç University,In-situ exploration of heart rate (HR) zones during cardio training (CT) is important for training efficiency. However  approaches for monitoring HR  either depend on complex visualizations on small screens (i.e.  smartwatches) or intrusive modalities (i.e. haptic  auditory) that might force the attention to the information. We developed an early prototype  Howel  a novel wrist-worn soft wearable to display HR zone information during CT. Our concept utilizes mapping information onto dynamic patterns (color changing stripes) as an easy-to-understand ambient display. To preserve non-intrusiveness  it uses non-emissive modality by heating thermochromic paints on its textile surfaces. Early feedback from three participants suggests that soft wearables with non- emissive dynamic patterns have potential (1) to embed information organically on the body  (2) to give easy-to-understand in-situ intensity information and (3) to keep the attention on the exercise instead of performance measures.
LBW1313: Flow: Towards Communicating Directional Cues through Inflatables,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Bruna Goveia da Rocha  Eindhoven University of Technology Oscar Tomico  ELISAVA & Eindhoven University of Technology,Current research in wearable technologies have shown that we can use real-time tactile instructions to support the learning of physical activities through vibrotactile stimulation. While tactile cues based on vibration may indicate direction  they do not convey the direction of movement. We would like to propose the use of inflatables as an alternative form of actuation to express such information through pressure. Inspired by notions from embodied interaction and somaesthetic design  we present in this paper a research through design (RtD) project that substitutes directional metaphors with push against the body. The result  Flow  is a wearable designed to cue six movements of the wrist/forearm to support the training of elementary sensory-motor skills of physical activities  such as foil fencing. We contribute with the description of the design process and reflections on how to design for tactile motion instructions through inflatables.
LBW1314: "Nothing Comes Before Profit": Asshole Design In the Wild,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Shruthi Sai Chivukula  Purdue University Chris Watkins  Purdue University Lucca McKay  Purdue University Colin M. Gray  Purdue University,Researchers in HCI and STS are increasingly interested in describing ethics and values relevant for design practice  including the formulation of methods to guide value application. However  little work has addressed ethical considerations as they emerge in everyday conversations about ethics in venues such as social media. In this late breaking work  we describe online conversations about a concept known as "asshole design" on Reddit  and the relationship of this concept to another practitioner-focused concept known as "dark patterns." We analyzed 1002 posts from the subreddit '/r/assholedesign' to identify the types of artifact being shared and the interaction purposes that were perceived to be manipulative or unethical as a type of "asshole design." We identified a subset of these posts relating to dark patterns  quantifying their occurrences using an existing dark patterns typology.
LBW1315: As If I Am There: A New Video Chat Interface Design for Richer Contextual Awareness,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jiajing Guo  Cornell University Yoyo Tsung-Yu Hou  Cornell University Harley Mueller  Cornell University Katherine Tang  Cornell University Susan R. Fussell  Cornell University,We introduce a novel video chat interface with a 360° photo as background in order to offer richer contextual and background information. We conduct a preliminary user evaluation in a lab setting. Paired participants were randomly assigned to two conditions  using regular interface or 360° photo interface. Each pair video chatted in pairs  then completed a post-study survey and answered several questions about their experience. Participants reported to have less behavioral interdependence and more inclusion using 360° photo video chat interface. They also reported having strong interest in employing it in long-distance intimate relationship  and made some suggestions for design iterations.
LBW1316: MementoKey: Keeping Passwords in Mind,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Bongkeum Jeong  ITI/LARSyS  M-ITI & University of Madeira Alexander Vallat  Imperial College Chris Csikszentmihalyi  ITI/LARSyS  M-ITI & University of Madeira Funchal Junwu Park  ITI/LARSyS  M-ITI & University of Madeira Funchal Dulce Pacheco  ITI/LARSyS  M-ITI & University of Madeira Funchal,In this paper  we introduce a novel system of password generation  MementoKey  consisting of private words that exist only in a user's memory and a corresponding set of public (non-secret) words that will facilitate users' recall of the private words  which they are associated with. We will demonstrate how MementoKey offers a useful alternative to existing options for storing passwords in password managers  or to using cryptographically weak  but memorable  passwords. We have conducted a user study to evaluate the word-association technique for recalling passwords and the effectiveness of our prototype software training and checking system to guide the user successfully through the memorization process. Our study involving 60 diverse participants indicates that our prototype can effectively lead users through a visualization and memorization technique to create a strong word-association memory between pairs of adjectives and nouns.
LBW1317: Dispelling the Blunt Perception of Social Technology,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jasper Jeurens  HAN University of Applied Sciences Koen van Turnhout  HAN University of Applied Sciences René Bakker  HAN University of Applied Sciences,Participatory design prescribes intensive stakeholder involvement in the design process. One challenge in such projects is to enable stakeholders to develop an open mind for novel solutions of the design problem at hand. When designing social technology  this is further complicated by prejudices about technology as being too blunt and inadequate to interfere with the sensitivity of social context. In this paper  we present a novel approach that supports a more neutral and open discussion on the benefits and pitfalls of social technology. The approach helps stakeholders see social technology in a broader perspective  which in turn enables the design of solutions with improved social sensitivity.
LBW1318: Opportunities of Quantified Self for Resocialisation of (Ex-)Convicts,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mick Jongeling  Amsterdam University of Applied Science Dan Xuu  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences Ilaria Zonda  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences Gijs Huisman  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences,Resocialisation is a guided process by which ex-convicts are introduced back into society. An issue that arises in this process is that ex-convicts are behind on technological developments when they return to society. Here  we present work on how quantified self technology  as an alternative to the present-day ankle monitor  can be a helpful tool to obtain overview and insight in their progress. In particular  we present a prototype that physically monitors stress levels as an indicator of behavioural patterns. Results from research with former convicts shows how giving ownership over tracking data can help the user group understand their societal status and become more sovereign during their resocialisation process. Finally  we reflect on ethical questions regarding data gathering  Quantified Other and privacy for ex-convicts.
LBW1319: Disconnect: A Proposal for Reclaiming Control in HCI,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Awais Hameed Khan  University of Queensland Scott Heiner  University of Queensland Ben Matthews  University of Queensland,As the lines between the digital and analog worlds become increasingly blurred  it is nearly impossible to traverse modern life without creating a digital footprint. This integration is so deep-rooted into the fabric of society  that if one attempted to choose to disconnect from today's hyperconnected world  one would have to move away from civilization. Weiser's vision of the omni-present  ubiquitous computer of the 21st century [21] has been realized  but at a cost. With invisible interfaces we forego the ability to recognize when we are being watched  heard or influenced by external actors. This paper takes a bottom-up approach of using design fiction narratives to explore how to design mechanisms of control (MoC) that may help reinstate human control and agency over our data. Preliminary results show emergent themes pertaining to data access  governance and sharing; the forms of MoC; as well as methodological lessons.
LBW1320: Flight Chair: An Interactive Chair for Controlling Emergency Service Drones,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Md. Nafiz Hasan Khan  Simon Fraser University Carman Neustaedter  Simon Fraser University Alissa N. Antle  Simon Fraser University,In future  emergency services will increasingly use technology to assist emergency service dispatchers and call taker with information during an emergency situation. One example could be the use of drones for surveying an emergency situation and providing contextual knowledge to emergency service call takers and first responders. The challenge is that drones can be difficult for users to maneuver in order to see specific items. In this paper  we explore the idea of a drone being controlled by an emergency call taker using embodied interaction on a tangible chair. The interactive chair  called Flight Chair  allows call takers to perform hands-free control of a drone through body movements on the chair. These include tilting and turning of one's body
LBW1321: Designing Personalities of Conversational Agents,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hankyung Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Dong Yoon Koh  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Gaeun Lee  Samsung Research Jung-Mi Park  Samsung Research Youn-kyung Lim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,Recent years have seen numerous attempts to imbue conversational agents with marked identities by crafting their personalities. However  the question remains as to how such personalities can be systematically designed. To address this problem  this paper proposes a conceptual framework for designing and communicating agent personalities. We conducted two design workshops with 12 designers  discovering three dimensions of an agent personality and three channels to express it. The study results revealed that an agent personality can be crafted by designing common traits shared within a service domain  distinctive traits added for a unique identity  and neutral traits left intentionally undecided or user-driven. Also  such a personality can be expressed through how an agent performs services  what contents it provides  and how it speaks and appears to be. Our results suggest a renewed view of the dimensions of conversational agent personalities.
LBW1322: Lucid Loop: A Virtual Deep Learning Biofeedback System for Lucid Dreaming Practice,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alexandra Kitson  Simon Fraser University Steve DiPaola  Simon Fraser University Bernhard E. Riecke  Simon Fraser University,Lucid dreaming  knowing one is dreaming while dreaming  is an important tool for exploring consciousness and bringing awareness to different aspects of life. We present a proof-of-concept system called Lucid Loop: a virtual reality experience where one can practice lucid awareness via biofeedback. Visuals are creatively generated before your eyes using a deep learning Artificial Intelligence algorithm to emulate the unstable and ambiguous nature of dreams. The virtual environment becomes more lucid or "clear" when the participant's physiological signals  including brain waves  respiration  and heart rate  indicate focused attention. Lucid Loop enables the virtual embodied experience of practicing lucid dreaming where written descriptions fail. It offers a valuable and novel technique for simulating lucid dreaming without having to be asleep. Future developments will validate the system and evaluate its ability to improve lucidity within the system by detecting and adapting to a participants awareness.
LBW1410: Eve: A Sketch-based Software Prototyping Workbench,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sarah Suleri  Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information and Technology FIT & RWTH Aachen University Vinoth Pandian Sermuga Pandian  Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information and Technology FIT & RWTH Aachen University Svetlana Shishkovets  Fraunhofer FIT & RWTH Aachen University Matthias Jarke  Fraunhofer FIT & RWTH Aachen University,Prototyping involves the evolution of an idea into various stages of design until it reaches a certain level of maturity. These design stages include low  medium and high fidelity prototypes. Workload analysis of prototyping using NASA-TLX showed an increase in workload specifically in frustration  temporal demand  effort  and decline in performance as the participants progressed from low to high fidelity. Upon reviewing numerous commercial and academic tools that directly or indirectly support software prototyping in one aspect or another  we identified a need for a comprehensive solution to support the entire software prototyping process. In this paper  we introduce Eve  a prototyping workbench that enables the users to sketch their concept as low fidelity prototype. It generates the consequent medium and high fidelity prototypes by means of UI element detection and code generation. We evaluated Eve using SUS with 15 UI/UX designers; the results depict good usability and high learnability (Usability score: 78.5). In future  we aim to study the impact of Eve on subjective workload experienced by users during software prototyping.
LBW1411: Auto-Inflatables: Chemical Inflation for Pop-Up Fabrication,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Penelope Webb  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Valentina Sumini  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Amos Golan  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Hiroshi Ishii  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,This research aims to utilize an output method for zero energy pop-up fabrication using chemical inflation as a technique for instant  hardware-free shape change. By applying state-changing techniques as a medium for material activation  we provide a framework for a two-part assembly process starting from the manufacturing side whereby a rigid structural body is given its form  through to the user side  where the form potential of a soft structure is activated and the structure becomes complete. To demonstrate this technique  we created two use cases: firstly  a compression material for emergency response  and secondly a self-inflating packaging system. This paper provides details on the auto-inflation process as well as the corresponding digital tool for the design of pneumatic materials. The results show the efficiency of using zero energy auto-inflatable structures for both medical applications and packaging. This rapidly deployable inflatable kit starts from the assumption that every product can provide its own contribution by responding in the best way to a specific application.
LBW1412: Designing Narrative Learning in the Digital Era,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Cristina Sylla  University of Minho  Portugal Vítor Martins  University of Minho  Portugal Gabriela Sá  University of Minho  Portugal Ana Paula Caruso  Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave Bruno Amaro  University of Minho  Portugal Douglas Menegazzi  Federal University of Santa Catarina Francisco Sylla  University of Minho  Portugal,This paper presents a first prototype of Mobeybou  a Digital Manipulative that uses physical blocks to interact with digital content. It intends to create an environment for promoting the development of language and narrative competences as well as digital literacy among pre and primary school children. Mobeybou offers a variety of characters  objects and landscapes from various cultures around the world and can be used for creating multicultural narratives. An interactive app developed for each country provides additional cultural and geographical information. A pilot study carried out with a group of 3rd graders showed that Mobeybou motivated and inspired them to actively and collaboratively create narratives integrating elements from the different countries. This may indicate Mobeybou's potential to promote multiculturalism.
LBW1413: Material Sketching: Towards the Digital Fabrication of Emergent Material Effects,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Iremnur Tokac  KU Leuven Herman Bruyninckx  KU Leuven Corneel Cannaerts  KU Leuven Andrew Vande Moere  KU Leuven,Designing for digital or robotic fabrication typically involves a virtual model in order to determine and coordinate the required operations of its construction. As a result  its creative design space becomes constrained to material expressions that can be predicted through digital modeling. This paper describes our preliminary thinking and first empirical results when this digital modeling phase is skipped  and the designing occurs interactively 'with' the fabrication operations themselves. By analyzing the material responses of corrugated cardboard to simple linear cutting operations that are executed by a robotic arm  we demonstrate how emergent material effects can be discovered improvisationally. Such material effects cannot be virtually modeled  however  they can be recreated and controlled by the robotic manipulations. We believe this form of 'material sketching' broadens the advances in 'human-fabrication interaction' towards a novel and unforeseeable expressions of physical form that require a much more direct  yet still digital  relationship with materiality.
LBW1414: BalBoa: A Balancing Board for Handstand Training,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Laia Turmo Vidal  Uppsala University Elena Márquez Segura  Uppsala University Luis Parrilla Bel  Uppsala University Annika Waern  Uppsala University,Balance is an essential physical skill to master  but a challenging one given that it requires a heightened body awareness to control  maintain and develop. In HCI physical training research  the design space of technology support for developing such body awareness remains narrow. Here  we introduce BalBoa  a balancing board to support balance training during handstands. We describe key highlights of the design process behind the Balboa  and present a work-in-progress prototype  which we tested with handstand beginners and experts. We discuss feedback from our users  preliminary insights  and sketch the future steps towards a fully developed prototype.
LBW1415: Grasping the Future: Identifying Potential Applications for Mid-Air Haptics in the Home,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lawrence Van den Bogaert  KU Leuven David Geerts  KU Leuven Isa Rutten  KU Leuven,Mid-air haptics is an emerging technology that can produce a sense of touch in mid-air using ultrasound. While the use of mid-air haptics has a lot of potential in various domains such as automotive  virtual reality or professional healthcare  we suggest that the home is an equally promising domain for such applications. We organized an ideation workshop with 15 participants preceded by a sensitizing phase to identify possible applications for mid-air haptics within the home. From the extensive set of ideas that resulted from this  five themes emerged: guidance  confirmation  information  warning and changing status. As general 'application categories'  we propose that they can provide a useful basis for the future design and development of mid-air haptic applications in the home  and possibly also beyond.
LBW1416: What You Sketch Is What You Get: Quick and Easy Augmented Reality Prototyping with PintAR,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Danilo Gasques  University of California  San Diego Janet G. Johnson  University of California  San Diego Tommy Sharkey  University of California  San Diego Nadir Weibel  University of California  San Diego,Augmented Reality(AR) tools are currently primarily targeted at programmers  making designing for AR challenging and time-consuming. We developed an interactive prototype  PintAR  that enables the authoring and rapid-prototyping of situated experiences by allowing designers to bring their ideas to life using a digital pen for sketching and a head-mounted display for visualizing and interacting with virtual content. In this paper  we explore the versatility such a tool could provide through case studies of a researcher  an artist  a ballerina  and a clinician.
LBW1417: Learning from Public Toilet Doors: Designing a Participatory Feedback Platform for a Connected Campus,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Dan Xuu  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences Ilaria Zonda  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences Mick Jongeling  Amsterdam University of Applied Science Gijs Huisman  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences,Writing on walls in public spaces has been a way for people to communicate and express themselves. In this paper  we present the design of a participatory feedback gathering system inspired by this practice. By engaging the campus community in sharing their feedback on the use of spaces and facilities  we aim to encourage them to participate in co-creating the campus space. Our prototype combines a physical object's affordance to attract attention with an internet forum to gather feedback. We document some key findings from our exploratory study and share ideas about future work.
LBW1418: Potentials and Challenges for User-generated Video Content in Public Libraries,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Daisy Yoo  Aarhus University Sofia Serholt  Chalmers University of Technology Nathália Novais  Aarhus University Eva Eriksson  Chalmers University of Technology & Aarhus University Clemens Klokmose  Aarhus University Peter Dalsgaard  Aarhus University,The role of libraries are rapidly shifting  in large part as a consequence of digitization. In addition to providing access to collections of books and other physical media  public libraries today are embracing a new role of becoming urban hubs  in which a wide range of activities take place. In these activities  local knowledge is developed  exchanged  and disseminated. However  there are still very few digital services that support this new role. Here  we explore how to develop digital services for supporting and leveraging user-generated video content in library activities. Based on interviews and design scenarios as probes  we describe the potentials and challenges for designing such services  as seen from the perspective of library staff. Our insights will inform the design of a new digital service for publics to participate in collaborative production of videos to document  exchange  and disseminate local knowledge generated in library activities.
LBW1419: Designing Computational Materiality: A Preliminary Study to Explore the Lived Experience with transTexture Lamp,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ce Zhong  Simon Fraser University Ron Wakkary  Simon Fraser University & Eindhoven University of Technology Doenja Oogjes  Simon Fraser University Amy Chen  Simon Fraser University,This paper articulates the design  manufacturing  and deployment of transTexture  a digital lamp features dynamic kinetic textures and changeable lighting effects. We deployed transTexture in the homes of two domain expert participants in a preliminary study to explore how computational materiality of interaction can fit a changing everyday environment. We conducted two semi-structured interviews with domain expert participants at the beginning and end of the field study. Based on the lived experiences uncovered in our initial findings  we elaborate on two notions that describe types of user engagements with computational materiality: transformation and Integration. We conclude with lessons learned from our study that will guide our future research on computational materiality.
LBW1420: ML-Process Canvas: A Design Tool to Support the UX Design of Machine Learning-Empowered Products,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Zhibin Zhou  Zhejiang University Qing Gong  Zhejiang University Zheting Qi  Zhejiang University Lingyun Sun  Zhejiang University,Machine learning (ML) is now widely used to empower products and services  but there is a lack of research on the tools that involve designers in the entire ML process. Thus  designers who are new to ML technology may struggle to fully understand the capabilities of ML  users  and scenarios when designing ML-empowered products. This paper describes a design tool  ML-Process Canvas  which assists designers in considering the specific factors of the user  ML system  and scenario throughout the whole ML process. The Canvas was applied to a design project  and was observed to contribute in the conceptual phase of UX design practice. In the future  we hope that the ML-Process Canvas will become more practical through continued use in design practice.
LBW1421: Growkit: Using Technology to Support People Growing Food at Home,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ilaria Zonda  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences Dan Xuu  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences Mick Jongeling  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences Gijs Huisman  Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences,The rapid growth of urban populations creates challenges for food production. One solution that is potentially more sustainable than current methods is localized production  in particular food production by individuals at home. Growing food at home is possible  but it is a process that requires motivation  knowledge and skills. Here  we present the design of a sensor platform aimed at helping individuals in urban environments grow food at home by informing them about the needs of their plants and  based on urban farming practices  by connecting them with a network of growers to share knowledge and produce.
LBW1422: Sign Language Recognition: Learning American Sign Language in a Virtual Environment,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jacob Schioppo  University of South Florida Zachary Meyer  University of South Florida Diego Fabiano  University of South Florida Shaun Canavan  University of South Florida,In this paper  we propose an approach  for sign language recognition  that makes use of a virtual reality headset to create an immersive environment. We show how features from data acquired by the Leap Motion controller  using an egocentric view  can be used to automatically recognize a user signed gesture. The Leap features are used along with a random forest for real-time classification of the user's gesture. We further analyze which of these features are most important  in an egocentric view  for gesture recognition. To test the efficacy of our proposed approach  we test on the 26 letters of the alphabet in American Sign Language in a virtual environment with an application for learning sign language.
LBW1510: ShadowLamp: An Ambient Display with Controllable Shadow Projection using Electrochromic Materials.,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Walther Jensen  Aalborg University Markus Löchtefeld  Aalborg University Hendrik Knoche  Aalborg University,In this paper we present ShadowLamp  a lamp concept supporting controllable shadow casting for displaying ambient information. The concept uses electrochromic displays to mask light and thereby allow switching of projected shadows. We implemented a prototype in a hexagon frame with six separately controlled LEDs compartmentalized to casts shadows in 60° angles. Alongside the LEDs  each compartment contains an electrochromic display for shadow control. As a use case we fabricated displays for a children's book and used them to change the shadows as the story progress. The displays and LEDs are controlled by a Bluetooth connected Android application.
LBW1511: Fibritary: Rotary Jet-Spinning for Personal Fiber Fabrication,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Natsuki Hamanishi  The University of Tokyo Michinari Kono  The University of Tokyo Shunichi Suwa  Sony CSL & The University of Tokyo Takashi Miyaki  The University of Tokyo Jun Rekimoto  The University of Tokyo & Sony CSL,The development of personal fabrication technologies has enabled end users to model and prototype desired objects. 3D printing technologies have eased our access to solid models  however  it is still a challenge to develop thin fibers rapidly at personal levels that may help enriching textures of models. We propose a system and method inspired by cotton candy making  which uses rotary jet-spinning to extract thin plastic fibers at high speed. We report our exploration of the proposed method where we studied various plastic materials  the effects of the rotation speed  and the hole size of the fiber exit. The method allows plastic fibers to be extracted at micro-scale  and we propose various examples of use cases. Our approach can be used in combination with traditional 3D printing techniques  where soft and/or hairy models are required to design the texture of a 3D model.
LBW1512: Temporal Proximity Filtering,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Arun Kumar  University of Minnesota  Twin Cities Karan Aggarwal  University of Minnesota  Twin Cities Paul Schrater  University of Minnesota  Twin Cities,Users bundle the consumption of their favorite content in temporal proximity to each other  according to their preferences and tastes. Thus  the underlying attributes of items implicitly match user preferences. However  current recommender systems largely ignore this fundamental driver in identifying matching items. In this work  we introduce a novel temporal proximity filtering method to enable items-matching. First  we demonstrate that proximity preferences exist. Second  we present a temporal proximity induced similarity metric driven by user tastes  and third  we show that this induced similarity can be used to learn items pairwise similarity in attribute space. The proposed model does not rely on any knowledge outside users' consumption and provide a novel way to devise user preferences and tastes driven novel items recommender.
LBW1513: Eevee: Transforming Images by Bridging High-level Goals and Low-level Edit Operations,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Michelle S. Lam  Stanford University Grace B. Young  Stanford University Catherine Y. Xu  Stanford University Ranjay Krishna  Stanford University Michael S. Bernstein  Stanford University,There is a significant gap between the high-level  semantic manner in which we reason about image edits and the low-level  pixel-oriented way in which we execute these edits. While existing image-editing tools provide a great deal of flexibility for professionals  they can be disorienting to novice editors because of the gap between a user's goals and the unfamiliar operations needed to actualize them. We present Eevee  an image-editing system that empowers users to transform images by specifying intents in terms of high-level themes. Based on a provided theme and an understanding of the objects and relationships in the original image  we introduce an optimization function that balances semantic plausibility  visual plausibility  and theme relevance to surface possible image edits. A formative evaluation finds that we are able to guide users to meet their goals while helping them to explore novel  creative ideas for their image edit.
LBW1514: Improving the Input Accuracy of Touchscreens using Deep Learning,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Abinaya Kumar  University of Stuttgart Aishwarya Radjesh  University of Stuttgart Sven Mayer  University of Stuttgart Huy Viet Le  University of Stuttgart,Touchscreens combine input and output in a single interface. While this enables an intuitive interaction and dynamic user interfaces  the fat-finger problem and the resulting occlusions still impact the input accuracy. Previous work presented approaches to improve the touch accuracy by involving visual features on the top side of fingers  as well as static compensation functions. While the former is not applicable on recent mobile devices as the top side of a finger cannot be tracked  compensation functions do not take properties such as finger angle into account. In this work  we present a data-driven approach to estimate the 2D touch position on commodity mutual capacitive touchscreens which increases the touch accuracy by 23.0% over recently implemented approaches.
LBW1515: Towards Narrative-Driven Atmosphere for Virtual Classrooms,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jean-Luc Lugrin  HCI Group & University of Würzburg Anne-Gwenn Bosser  Lab-STICC Marc Erich Latoschik  HCI Group & University of Würzburg Mathieu Chollet  University of Glasgow Yann Glémarec  ENIB Lab-STICC Birgit Lugrin  Julius-Maximilians-University Würzburg,In this paper  we propose the integration of audience atmosphere generation techniques into Interactive Storytelling (IS) engines to obtain more realistic and variable Virtual Reality (VR) training systems. We outline a number of advantages of this novel combination compared to current atmosphere generation techniques. The features of recent IS engines can be extended to automatically adapt the atmosphere produced by a group of virtual humans in response to user intervention while staying coherent with the unfolding story of the training scenario. This work is currently being developed in the context of a VR training for teachers  in which they learn to manage a difficult classroom under the guidance of an instructor.
LBW1516: Interactive Visualizer to Facilitate Game Designers in Understanding Machine Learning,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jiachi Xie  Drexel University Chelsea M. Myers  Drexel University Jichen Zhu  Drexel University,Machine Learning (ML) is a useful tool for modern game designers but often requires a technical background to understand. This gap of knowledge can intimidate less technical game designers from employing ML techniques to evaluate designs or incorporate ML into game mechanics. Our research aims to bridge this gap by exploring interactive visualizations as a way to introduce ML principles to game designers. We have developed QUBE  an interactive level designer that shifts ML education into the context of game design. We present QUBE's interactive visualization techniques and evaluation through two expert panels (n=4  n=6) with game design  ML  and user experience experts.
LBW1517: IPME Workbench: A Data Processing Tool for Mixed-Methodology Studies of Group Interactions,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Harish Naik  University of Illinois at Chicago Debaleena Chattopadhyay  University of Illinois at Chicago,Today's small group interactions often occur in multi-device  multi-artifact ecosystems. CHI researchers studying these group interactions may adopt a socio-behavioral or sensing/data mining approach or both. A mixed-methodological approach for studying group interactions in collocated settings require collecting data from a range of sources  like audio  video  multiple sensor streams  and multiple software logs. Analyzing these disparate data sources systematically - with opportunities to rapidly form and correct research insights can help researchers who study group interactions. But engineering solutions assimilating multiple data sources to support different methodologies  ranging from grounded theory methodology to log analysis are rarely found. To address this frequent and tedious problem of data collection and processing in mixed-methodology studies of group interactions  we introduce a workbench tool: Interaction Proxemics in Multi-Device Ecologies (IPME). The IPME workbench synchronizes multiple data sources  provides data visualization  and opportunities for data correction and annotation.
LBW1518: Interactive Lyric Translation System: Implementation and Experiments,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ayano Nishimura  Ochanomizu University Takayuki Itoh  Ochanomizu University,We can listen to music from many di?erent countries due to the evolution of the Internet. However  understanding lyrics written in foreign languages is still di?cult  even though many international songs have been translated. In this paper  we propose an interactive lyric translation system and describe its implementation. Users can modify lyrics by selecting a sample lyric from candidate translations and then freely edit the lyric using the proposed system. The proposed system also allows users to listen to their translation by applying singing voice synthesizer and search for related words. We conducted experiments with 12 participants to compare the lyric translation by the proposed system to manual lyric translation. The translation using the proposed system had better evaluation results comparing to the manual translation.
LBW1519: Experizone: Integrating Situated Scientific Experimentation with Teaching of the Scientific Method,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jonas Oppenlaender  University of Oulu Simo Hosio  University of Oulu,Citizen Science projects ask their participants to contribute work to pre-defined topics  thereby typically rendering the participants as mere consumers of often narrowly defined tasks. In this work-in-progress paper  we present our work on an interactive experimentation platform that allows anybody – researchers as well as members of the crowd – to run experiments and test scientific hypotheses with a local crowd of volunteers. The platform also enforces a lightweight review process for teaching its users how to formulate valid scientific hypotheses and experimental designs.
LBW1520: A Dynamic Hierarchical Approach to Modelling and Orchestrating the Web of Things Using the DOM  CSS and JavaScript,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alex Owen  University of Southampton Kirk Martinez  University of Southampton,There is a lot of work in progress by the W3C and others surrounding a Web standards compliant Web of Things (WoT) which it is hoped will unify the current Internet of Things infrastructure. Our contribution to this uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to represent complex physical environments  with a CSS-like syntax for storing and controlling the state of 'things' within it. We describe how JavaScript can be used in conjunction with these to create an approach which is familiar to Web developers and may help them to transition more smoothly into WoT development. We share our implementation and explore some of the many potential avenues for future research. These include rich WoT development tools and the possibility of content production for physical environments.
LBW1521: Coordi: A Virtual Reality Application for Reasoning about Mathematics in Three Dimensions,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Harrison Pearl  Northwestern University Hillary Swanson  Northwestern University Michael Horn  Northwestern University,The goal of our research has been to create software that extends the benefits of virtual reality (VR) to mathematics education. We report on the design and evaluation of a VR application meant to support students' reasoning about objects in three-dimensional (3D) coordinate systems and to explore the possibilities of the application for mathematics education in high school classrooms.
LBW1522: A Mouse (H)Over a Hotspot Survey: An Exploration of Patterns of Hesitation through Cursor Movement Metrics,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lucas Pereira  Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute & prsma.com,This paper presents the results of an empirical exploration of 10 cursor movement metrics designed to measure respondent hesitation in online surveys. As a use case  this work considers an online survey aimed at exploring how people gauge the electricity consumption of domestic appliances. The cursor metrics were derived computationally from the mouse trajectories when rating the consumption of each appliance and analyzed using Multidimensional Scaling  Jenks Natural Breaks  and the Jaccard Similarity Index techniques. The results show that despite the fact that the metrics measure different aspects of the mouse trajectories  there is an agreement with respect to the appliances that generated higher levels of hesitation. The paper concludes with an outline of future work that should be carried out in order to further understand how cursor trajectories can be used to measure respondent hesitation.
LBW1610: Self-Efficacy-Based Game Design to Encourage Security Behavior Online,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tianying Chen  Carnegie Mellon University Jessica Hammer  Carnegie Mellon University Laura Dabbish  Carnegie Mellon University,Eliciting cybersecurity behavior change in users has been a difficult task. Although most users have concerns about their safety online  few take precautions. Transformational games offer a promising avenue for cybersecurity behavior change. To date  however  studies typically focus on entertainment value instead of investigating the effectiveness and design potential of games in cybersecurity. As a first step to filling this gap  we present the design of Hacked Time  a desktop game that aims to encourage cybersecurity behavior change by translating self-efficacy theory into the game's design. As cybersecurity games are a relatively novel area  our design aims to serve as a prototype for mapping specific behavior change principles relevant to this area onto game design practice.
LBW1611: IPANDA: A Playful Hybrid Product for Facilitating Children's Wildlife Conservation Education,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yang Chen  Zhejiang University Yuyu Lin  Zhejiang University Junwu Wang  Zhejiang of University Lijuan Liu  Zhejiang University Cheng Yao  Zhejiang University Fangtian Ying  China Academy of Art,In this paper  we introduced the concept of a hybrid product which combines a digital game with physical experiences and discussed practical recommendations for hybrid products development in the domain of wildlife conservation for children. IPANDA including hardware and software applications with sensing technology was able to gather real-time environmental data and connected to one virtual wildlife experiencing environmental challenges regarding its living habits. Children who play the product can learn about the environment around them and foster wildlife protection awareness. To evaluate our conceptual system  we created a preliminary prototype and conducted user study within the semi-structured interview and Smileyometer. Our striking findings revealed IPANDA as a promising tool to serve as groundwork to encourage children to explore the physical environment and gain potential wildlife protection education.
LBW1612: Outstanding: A Perspective-Switching Technique for Covering Large Distances in VR Games,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sebastian Cmentowski  University of Duisburg-Essen Andrey Krekhov  University of Duisburg-Essen Jens Krueger  University of Duisburg-Essen,Room-scale virtual reality games allow players to experience an unmatched level of presence. A major reason is the natural navigation provided by physical walking. However  the tracking space is still limited  and viable alternatives or extensions are required to reach further virtual destinations. Our current work focuses on traveling over (very) large distances--an area where approaches such as teleportation are too exhausting and WIM teleportations potentially reduce presence. Our idea is to equip players with the ability to switch from first-person to a third-person god-mode perspective on demand. From above  players can command their avatar similar to a real-time strategy game and initiate travels over large distance. In our first exploratory evaluation  we learned that the proposed dynamic switching is intuitive  increases spatial orientation  and allows players to maintain a high degree of presence throughout the game. Based on the outcomes of a participatory design workshop  we also propose a set of extensions to our technique that should be considered in the future.
LBW1613: Impact of Game Elements in Players Artistic Experience,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Rui Craveirinha  University of Coimbra Licinio Roque  University of Coimbra,This paper analyses the impact that introducing game elements can have in players' artistic valuation of video-games. We put forth a hypothesis that aesthetic experiences are incompatible with game elements (challenges and rewards/penalties). We tested it  by allowing (n=76) subjects to experience two different variants of the same artistic video game  one with game elements  another without. Using a mixed methods approach  we study results from self-reports and open-ended questionnaires. These indicate that in the game version's case  subjects reported being less focused in understanding the experience's meaning and found it less meaningful to a statistically significant degree. Therefore  we conclude that game designers seeking to mediate artistic experiences should be cautious in the introduction of game elements  as they can negatively impact the experience's value.
LBW1614: MirrorMe: Increasing Prosocial Behaviour in Public Transport,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ida Damen  Eindhoven University of Technology Maximilian Brehm  Hasso Plattner Institute Andrea Bravo  Universitat Pompeu Fabra John McClelland  Carleton University Anouk Harde  University College London Julian Frommel  Ulm University Regina Bernhaupt  Eindhoven Technical University,Public transport can be a place where commuters feel rushed or stressed. Missing your train  a delayed bus or crowdedness at the station does not induce happiness among most people. As a consequence  prosocial behaviour like offering someone a seat is displayed less often. We discuss the design and design process of MirrorMe  a simple communal game to induce positive mood of commuters. MirrorMe aims to increase prosocial behaviour through mimicry. Commuters are challenged to "make a face" and thereby connect to other commuters. MirrorMe will be installed in a public display close to a train station enabling access to all commuters and passers-by. This work addresses the need for games and play in public setting to stimulate prosocial behaviour. It exemplifies how multidisciplinary HCI approaches in a gamejam setting can contribute to real life challenges. We conclude with open questions for impact evaluation in future work.
LBW1615: iGYM: A Wheelchair-Accessible Interactive Floor Projection System for Co-located Physical Play,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Roland Graf  University of Michigan Sun Young Park  University of Michigan Emma Shpiz  University of Michigan Hun Seok Kim  University of Michigan,Physical play opportunities for people with motor disabilities typically do not include co-located play with peers without disabilities in traditional sport settings. In this paper  we present a prototype of a wheelchair-accessible interactive floor projection system  iGYM  designed to enable people with motor disabilities to compete on par with  and in the same environment as  peers without disabilities. iGYM provides two key system features—peripersonal circle interaction and adjustable game mechanic (physics)—that enable individualized game calibration and wheelchair-accessible manipulation of virtual targets on the floor. Preliminary findings from our pilot study with people with motor disabilities using power wheelchairs  manual wheelchairs  and people without disabilities showed that the prototype system was accessible for all participants at higher than anticipated target speeds. Our work has implications for designing novel  physical play opportunities in inclusive traditional sport settings.
LBW1616: Beyond Horror and Fear: Exploring Player Experience Invoked by Emotional Challenge in VR Games,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xiaolan Peng  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences & Chinese Academy of Sciences Jin Huang  Chinese Academy of Sciences Linghan Li  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Chen Gao  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Hui Chen  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences & Chinese Academy of Sciences Feng Tian  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences & Chinese Academy of Sciences Hongan Wang  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences & Chinese Academy of Sciences,Digital gameplay experience depends not only on the type of challenge that the game provides  but also on how the challenge be presented. With the introduction of a novel type of emotional challenge and the increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR)  there is a need to explore player experience invoked by emotional challenge in VR games. We selected two games that provides emotional challenge and conducted a 24-subject experiment to compare the impact of a VR and monitor-display version of each game on multiple player experiences. Preliminary results show that many positive emotional experiences have been enhanced significantly with VR while negative emotional experiences such as horror and fear have less been influenced; participants' perceived immersion and presence were higher when using VR than using monitor-display. Our finding of VR's expressive capability in emotional experiences may encourage more design and research with regard to emotional challenge in VR games.
LBW1617: FoBo: Towards Designing a Robotic Companion for Solo Dining,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Rohit Ashok Khot  RMIT University Eshita Sri Arza  Indian Institute of Information Technology Design & Manufacturing Kancheepuram Harshitha Kurra  RMIT University Yan Wang  RMIT University,Despite the known benefits of commensal eating  eating alone is becoming increasingly common as people struggle to find time and manage geographical boundaries to enjoy a meal together. Eating alone however can be boring  less motivating and shown to have negative impact on health and wellbeing of a person. To remedy such situations  we undertake a celebratory view on robotic technology to offer unique opportunities for solo-diners to feel engaged and indulged in dining. We present  Fobo  a speculative design prototype for a mischievous robotic dining companion that acts and behaves like a human co-diner. Besides tackling solo-dining  this work also aims to reorient the perception that robots are not always meant to be infallible. They could be erroneous and clumsy  like we humans are.
LBW1618: Designing an Escape Room in the City for Public Engagement with AI-enhanced Surveillance,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tomo Kihara  TU Delft Roy Bendor  TU Delft Derek Lomas  TU Delft,Escape the Smart City is a critical pervasive game that uses an escape room format to help players develop an understanding of the implications of urban surveillance technologies. Set in downtown Amsterdam  players work together as a team of hackers to stop the mass deployment of an all-seeing AI-enhanced surveillance system. In order to defeat the system players need to understand its attributes and exploit its weaknesses. Novel gameplay elements include locating hidden surveillance cameras in the city  discovering and exploiting algorithmic biases in computer vision  and exploring new techniques to avoid facial recognition systems. This work makes two distinct contributions to the CHI community: first  it introduces critical pervasive games as an approach to engage the public in complex sociotechnical issues  and second  it experiments with the escape room format as a platform for critical play.
LBW1619: Moldy Ghosts and Yeasty Invasions: Glitches in Hybrid Bio-Digital Games,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Raphael Kim  Queen Mary University Roland van Dierendonck  Studio Roland van Dierendonck Stefan Poslad  Queen Mary University,Hybrid bio-digital games integrate real  biological materials into computer systems. They offer a rich  playful space in which interactions between humans  computers  and non-human organisms can be explored. However  the concept of video game 'glitching' in hybrid bio-digital games  specifically those that result from interactions between the biological and the computer hardware and/or software  have not been explored in great detail. We report two incidences of glitches observed during Mold Rush – a hybrid bio-digital game based on growth patterns of living mold: The creation of an additional game character (Moldy Ghosts)  and the gameplay freeze (a Yeasty Invasion). As we interpret our observations  we question the potential for glitches to become valuable tools in framing HCI investigations into designing a productive and meaningful biological-digital interactions. The goal of this paper is to propose three testable routes in which glitches could be implemented. 1) Glitch as a tool for learning 2) Glitch as a precursor for an experience-enhancing game component  and 3) Glitch as an instigator for discourse on ethical implications of bio-digital games.
LBW1620: HedgewarsSGC: A Competitive Shared Game Control Setting,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Pascal Lessel  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) Maximilian Altmeyer  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) Matthias Hennemann  Saarland University Antonio Krüger  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI),Sharing game control (SGC) is a multiplayer context that is considered within games user research. With the popular Twitch Plays Pokémon  settings of this type have also received broad media attention. In this paper  we introduce and describe HedgewarsSGC  our modifications to the open-source game Hedgewars to investigate different player roles in this shared game control context: besides considering competing groups who share control over their units via input aggregators  it also provides options for spectators that do not want to give up individual control. Thus  HedgewarsSGC is an approach to investigate SGC in such a scenario and additionally  allows further reasoning about input aggregation.
LBW1621: Gamification of a To-Do List with Emotional Reinforcement,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Shaun Alexander Macdonald  University of Glasgow Stephen Brewster  University of Glasgow,Gamification can change how and why people interact with software. A common approach is to use quantitative feedback to give users a feeling of progress or achievement. There are  however  other ways to provide users with motivation or meaning during normal computer interactions  such as using emotional reinforcement. This could provide a powerful new tool to allow the positive effects of gamification to reach wider contexts. This paper investigates the design and evaluation of a mobile to-do list application  'Tamu To-Do'  which utilises gamified emotional reinforcement  as seen in Figure 1. A week-long field study (N=9) recorded user activity and impressions with the application. The results supported emotional reinforcement's potential as a gamification strategy to improve user motivation and engagement.
LBW1622: Left-Handed Control Configuration for Side-Scrolling Games,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alain Maubert Crotte  University of Regina Daryl H. Hepting  University of Regina Anastasia Roshchina  University of Regina,Nowadays video games are more inclusive: children  disabled people  and seniors are considered. However  there are players that require special configuration so they could enjoy playing equally. One of these types of players is left-handed players. In order to determine whether to create a special configuration designed for the needs of left-handed audience  we carried out a study where left-handed players were targeted and offered to play with two types of control: a standard right-handed and a customized left-handed configuration. A significant main effect on player experience on the left-handed control configuration was demonstrated. The study reveals the importance of a catered control configuration to create a fair  non-stressful and user-friendly environment for players.
LBW1710: FRVRIT: A Tool for Full Body Virtual Reality Game Evaluation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Daniel MacCormick  University of Ontario Institute of Technology Alain Sangalang  University of Ontario Institute of Technology Jackson Rushing  University of Ontario Institute of Technology Ravnik Singh Jagpal  University of Ontario Institute of Technology Pejman Mirza-Babaei  University of Ontario Institute of Technology Loutfouz Zaman  University of Ontario Institute of Technology,Virtual reality (VR) games continue to grow in popularity with the advancement of commercial VR capabilities such as the inclusion of full body tracking. This means game developers can design for novel interactions involving a player's full body rather than solely relying on controller input. However  existing research on evaluating player interaction in VR games primarily focuses on game content and inputs from game controllers or player hands. Current approaches for evaluating player full body interactions are limited to simple qualitative observation which makes evaluation difficult and time-consuming. We present a Full Room Virtual Reality Investigation Tool (FRVRIT) which combines data recording and visualization to provide a quantitative solution for evaluating player movement and interaction in VR games. The tool facilitates objective data observation through multiple visualization methods that can be manipulated  allowing developers to better observe and record player movements in the VR space to improve and iterate on the desired interactions in their games.
LBW1711: Understanding Experiences of Blind Individuals in Outdoor Nature,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Maryam Bandukda  University College London Aneesha Singh  University College London Nadia Berthouze  University College London Catherine Holloway  University College London,Research shows that exposure to nature has benefits for people's mental and physical health and that ubiquitous and mobile technologies encourage engagement with nature. However  existing research in this area is primarily focused on people without visual impairments and is not inclusive of blind and partially sighted individuals. To address this gap in research  we interviewed seven blind people (without remaining vision) about their experiences when exploring and experiencing the outdoor natural environment to gain an understanding of their needs and barriers and how these needs can be addressed by technology. In this paper  we present the three themes identified from the interview data; independence  knowledge of the environment  and sensory experiences.
LBW1712: Perceptions of Chatbots in Therapy,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Samuel Bell  University of Cambridge Clara Wood  Ieso Digital Health Advait Sarkar  Microsoft Research,Several studies have investigated the clinical efficacy of remote-  internet- and chatbot-based therapy  but there are other factors  such as enjoyment and smoothness  that are important in a good therapy session. We piloted a comparative study of therapy sessions following the interaction of 10 participants with human therapists versus a chatbot (simulated using a Wizard of Oz protocol)  finding evidence to suggest that when compared against a human therapist control  participants find chatbot-provided therapy less useful  less enjoyable  and their conversations less smooth (a key dimension of a positively-regarded therapy session). Our findings suggest that research into chatbots for cognitive behavioural therapy would be more effective when directly addressing these drawbacks.
LBW1713: Preferred Appearance of Captions Generated by Automatic Speech Recognition for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Viewers,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Larwan Berke  Rochester Institute of Technology Khaled Albusays  Rochester Institute of Technology Matthew Seita  Rochester Institute of Technology Matt Huenerfauth  Rochester Institute of Technology,As the accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) nears human-level quality  it might become feasible as an accessibility tool for people who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) to transcribe spoken language to text. We conducted a study using in-person laboratory methodologies  to investigate requirements and preferences for new ASR-based captioning services when used in a small group meeting context. The open-ended comments reveal an interesting dynamic between: caption readability (visibility of text) and occlusion (captions blocking the video contents). Our 105 DHH participants provided valuable feedback on a variety of caption-appearance parameters (strongly preferring familiar styles such as closed captions)  and in this paper we start a discussion on how ASR captioning could be visually styled to improve text readability for DHH viewers.
LBW1714: Paper Prototyping Comfortable VR Play for Diverse Sensory Needs,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,LouAnne Boyd  Chapman University Kendra Day  Chapman University Ben Wasserman  Chapman University Kaitlyn Abdo  Chapman University Gillian Hayes  University of California  Irvine Erik Linstead  Chapman University,We co-designed paper prototype dashboards for virtual environments for three children with diverse sensory needs. Our goal was to determine individual interaction styles in order to enable comfortable and inclusive play. As a first step towards an inclusive virtual world  we began with designing for three sensory-diverse children who have labels of neurotypical  ADHD  and autism respectively. We focused on their leisure interests and their individual sensory profiles. We present the results of co-design with family members and paper prototyping sessions were conducted by family members with the children. The results contribute preliminary empirical findings for accommodating different levels of engagement and empowering users to adjust environmental thresholds through interaction design.
LBW1715: Designing Free-Living Reports for Parkinson's Disease,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Diogo Branco  Universidade de Lisboa Raquel Bouça  Universidade de Lisboa Joaquim Ferreira  Universidade de Lisboa Tiago Guerreiro  Universidade de Lisboa,Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is also characterized by its motor fluctuations throughout the day. This makes clinical assessment to be hard to accomplish in an appointment as the patient status at the time may be largely different from his condition two hours before. Clinicians can only evaluate patients from time to time  making symptom fluctuations difficult to discern. The emergence of wearable sensors enabled the continuous monitoring of patients out of the clinic  in a free-living environment. Although  these sensors exist and they are being explored in a research setting  there have been limited efforts in understanding which information and how it should be presented to non-technical people  clinicians (and patients). To fill this gap  we started by performing a focus group with clinicians to capture the information they would like to see devised from free-living sensors  and the different levels of detail they envision. Building on the insights collected  we developed a data-driven platform  DataPark  that presents usable visualizations of data collected from a wearable tri-axial accelerometer. It enables report parameterization and includes a battery of state-of-the-art algorithms to quantify physical activity  sleep  and clinical evaluations. A two-month preliminary deployment in a rehabilitation clinic showed that patients feel rewarded and included by receiving a report  and that the change in paradigm is not burdensome and adds information for clinicians to support their decisions.
LBW1716: Digitally Augmenting the Physical Ground Space with Timed Visual Cues for Crutch-Assisted Walking,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Beatriz Peres  M-ITI  University of Madeira Pedro F. Campos  ITI/Larsys and University of Madeira Aida Azadegan  University of Reading,This late-breaking work presents initial results regarding a novel mobile-projection system  aimed at helping people to learn how to walk with crutches. The existing projection-based solutions for gait training disorders are based on walking over a fixed surface (usually a treadmill). In contrast  our solution projects visual cues (footprints and crutch icons) directly into the floor  augmenting the physical space surrounding the crutches  in a portable way. Walking with crutches is a learning skill that requires continuous repetition and constant attention to detail to make sure they are being used correctly  avoiding negative consequences  such as falls or injuries. We conducted expert consultation sessions  and we identified the main issues that patients face when walking with crutches. This informed the design of Augmented Crutches. We performed a qualitative evaluation and conclude with design implications: the importance of timing  self-assurance and awareness.
LBW1717: Virtual Humans in Health-Related Interventions: A Meta-Analysis,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tengteng Ma  University of Illinois at Chicago Hasti Sharifi  University of Illinois at Chicago Debaleena Chattopadhyay  University of Illinois at Chicago,Virtual humans are computer-generated characters designed to simulate key properties of human face-to-face conversation---verbal and nonverbal. Their human-like physical appearance and nonverbal behavior set them apart from chatbot-type embodied conversational agents  and has recently received significant interest as a potential tool for health-related interventions. As healthcare providers deliberate whether to adopt this new technology  it is crucial to examine the empirical evidence about their effectiveness. We systematically evaluated evidence from controlled studies of interventions using virtual humans on their effectiveness in health-related outcomes. Nineteen studies were included from a total of 3354 unique records. Although study objectives varied greatly  most targeted psychological conditions  such as mood  anxiety  and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Virtual humans demonstrated effectiveness in improving health-related outcomes  more strongly when targeting clinical conditions  such as ASD or pain management  than general wellness  such as weight loss. We discuss the emerging differences when designing for clinical interventions versus wellness.
LBW1718: Family-Based Sleep Technologies: Opportunities and Challenges,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anna Cherenshchykova  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis & Indiana University Andrew D. Miller  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis & Indiana University,Sleep is a critical component of overall wellness  and pervasive and ubiquitous computing technologies have shown promise for allowing individuals to track and manage their sleep quality. However  sleep quality is also affected by interpersonal factors  especially for families with young children. In this study  we adopted a family informatics approach to understand opportunities and challenges for sleep technologies at the family level. We conducted home-based interviews with 10 families with young children  asking them about their current practices  values  and perceived role for technology. We describe challenges across three phases: bedtime  nighttime  and waking. We show that family-based sleep technologies may have the greatest impact by supporting family activities and rituals  encouraging children's independence  and providing comfort.

However  the use of SDM in practice can be obstructed by a number of factors  such as time constraints or lack of applicability due to patient characteristics. Our project  PrepDoc  explores how a Virtual Training Doctor (VTD) can help patients overcome some of these obstacles to experiencing effective SDM during doctor's visits. In this paper  we report on user studies conducted with 19 participants in Scotland aged 65+. The goal of these studies was to identify the reactions of this audience to the PrepDoc system  evaluate its suitability within Scotland  and elicit suggestions to improve it. Our findings revealed that the idea of empowering people to participate in SDM using a virtual agent was positively received by all participants. However  the reactions to how this idea was implemented in the PrepDoc system varied greatly across participants. Based on this  our paper outlines recommendations for enhancing the user experience with VTDs  accommodating individual differences of older adults  and accounting for the national context.
LBW1720: HeliCoach: A Drone-based System Supporting Orientation and Mobility Training for the Visually Impaired,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Qicheng Ding  Lenovo Research Jiangtao Gong  Lenovo Research Jingwei Sun  Peking University Penghui Xu  Lenovo Research Liuxin Zhang  Lenovo Research Qianying Wang  Lenovo Research Yu Zhang  Lenovo Research,Orientation and mobility (O&M) training is essential for improving the independence and wellbeing of the visually impaired. However  the shortage of qualified trainers and the unengaging training contents limit the number of O&M training recipients. In this paper  we propose a drone-based intelligent tutor system - HeliCoach - to provide cost-effective and personalized O&M training. We first elaborate on the system design and potential scenarios of HeliCoach use. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of this concept using a preliminary user study. Finally  we discuss the implication and challenges of this system.
LBW1721: Designing for Reminiscence with People with Dementia,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,James Edmeads  University of Bristol Oussama Metatla  University of Bristol,We investigate how technology can be used to support people with dementia to engage in Reminiscence Therapy. We used a participatory design approach carried out over three stages: scope  design and evaluation  involving five participants with dementia. We also engaged professionals and caregivers through a survey. We provide initial recommendations for engaging participants with dementia on how they wish to reminisce and what technology may support this.
LBW1722: MATY: Designing An Assistive Robot for People with Alzheimer's,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hugo Simão  Universidade de Lisboa Tiago Guerreiro  Universidade de Lisboa,Caregiving to a person with Alzheimer's can be a very demanding task  both from physical and psychological perspectives. Technological responses to support caregiving  and improve the quality of life of people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers are lacking. Using a research through design approach  we devised a robot focused on empowering people with Alzheimer and fostering their autonomy  from the initial sketch to a working prototype. MATY is a robot that encourages communication with relatives and promotes routines by eliciting the person to take action  using a multisensorial approach (e.g.  projecting biographical images  playing suggestive sounds  or emitting soothing aromas). The paper reports the iterative  incremental design process performed together with stakeholders. We share first lessons learned in this process with HCI researchers and practitioners designing solutions  particularly robots  to assist people with dementia and their caregivers.
LBW1810: An N-of-1 Evaluation Framework for Behaviour Change Applications,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Claire McCallum  Northumbria University John Rooksby  Northumbria University Parvin Asadzadeh  Northumbria University Cindy M. Gray  University of Glasgow Matthew Chalmers  University of Glasgow,Mobile behaviour change applications should be evaluated for their effectiveness in promoting the intended behavior changes. In this paper we argue that the 'gold standard' form of effectiveness evaluation  the randomised controlled trial  has shortcomings when applied to mobile applications. We propose that N-of-1 (also known as single case design) based approaches have advantages. There is currently a lack of guidance for researchers and developers on how to take this approach. We present a framework encompassing three phases and two related checklists for performing N-of-1 evaluations. We also present our analysis of using this framework in the development and deployment of an app that encourages people to walk more. Our key findings are that there are challenges in designing engaging apps that automate N-of-1 procedures  and that there are challenges in collecting sufficient data of good quality. Further research should address these challenges.
LBW1811: Ergotact: Including Force-based Activities into Post-stroke Rehabilitation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Christine Megard  LIST Sylvain Bouchigny  LIST Antoine Martin  LIST Rafik Goulamhoussen  Genious Healthcare Lucile Bertholier  Genious Healthcare Pierre Foulon  Healthcare Samuel Pouplin  Lab. End:icap - PNT Celine Bonnyaud  Lab. End:icap - LAM Nicolas Roche  Lab. End:icap LAM Axelle Gelineau  Lab. End:icap - PNT Frédéric Barbot  APHP  Hopital Raymond Poincaré,Ergotact introduces the possibility of including force-based rehabilitation activities of the upper limb of post-stroke survivors. These activities are integrated into a dedicated game which is deployed on a tabletop. The patient interacts in the game with a tangible object which has to be moved  rotated  tightened/untightened and lifted according to the gameplay. The surface of the object is equipped with a matrix of force sensors which allows to introduce force-based activities into the game; for the purpose of the game  the object also includes an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The paper presents the concept and first feedbacks from therapists.
LBW1812: Understanding and Correcting Inaccurate Calorie Estimations on Amazon Mechanical Turk,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lillio Mok  University of Toronto Brenna Li  University of Toronto Stephen Gou  University of Toronto Joseph Jay Williams  University of Toronto,Current research on technology for fitness is often focused on tracking and encouraging healthy lifestyles. In contrast  we adopt an approach based on improving consumer knowledge of food energy. An interactive survey was distributed on Amazon Mechanical Turk to assess how well crowdworkers can judge the calories in a series of foods. Our subjects yielded results comparable to traditional participants  exhibiting well-known phenomena such as underestimating the energy contained in foods perceived to be healthy. Several techniques from the online education literature  such as prompts for reflection  were also investigated for their efficacy at increasing estimation accuracy. Although calories were more accurately judged after applying these methods on aggregate  the effects of individual techniques on our participants were inconclusive. A more thorough investigation is thus needed into effective educational methods for correcting calorie estimations on the Web.
LBW1813: Reaching Optimal Health: The Voice of Clinicians from a Roleplay Simulation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hoang D. Nguyen  University of Glasgow Singapore Øystein Eiring  Norwegian Institute for Public Health,Helping patients to reach optimal health entails a holistic approach of complex interventions including clinical decision support systems  patient decision aids  and self-management tools. In real-world settings  understanding the human factors in technological interventions is the core of HCI research; however  it requires a considerable amount of time to run experimental procedures  especially for patients with mental disorders. We conducted a roleplay simulation over a period of two weeks that comprised observations  and semi-structured interviews with eight health care professionals participated in the simulated use of a health optimization system. The study revealed the SWING model of enabling interventions towards optimal health as i) Sharing feelings  ii) Weaving of information  iii) Improving awareness  iv) Nurturing trust v) Giving support. This model establishes a common path from research to practice for researchers and practitioners in eHealth and HCI.
LBW1814: Nurse-led Design and Development of an Expert System for Pressure Ulcer Management,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Débora Abranches  City  University of London Dympna O'Sullivan  Technical University Dublin Jon Bird  University of Bristol,The use of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) is known to enable better care outcomes by promoting a consistent way of treating patients. This paper describes a user-centered design approach involving nurses  to develop a prototype expert system for modelling CPGs for Pressure Ulcer management. The system was developed using Visirule  a software tool that uses a graphical approach to modeling knowledge. The system was evaluated by 5 staff nurses and compared nurses' time and accuracy to assess a wound using CPGs accessed via the Intranet of an NHS Trust and the expert system. A post task qualitative evaluation revealed that nurses found the system useable with a systematic design  that it increased access to CPGs by reducing time and effort required by other usual methods of access  that it provided opportunities for learning due to its interactive nature  and that its recommendations were more actionable that those provided by usual static CPG documents.
LBW1815: Efficacy of Film for Raising Awareness of Diverse Users,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Cynthia Putnam  DePaul University Christina Hanschke  DePaul University Anuradha Rana  DePaul University,Technology companies are increasingly acknowledging the need to make their products usable for diverse users that include people with disabilities and aging populations; as a result  educators need to consider how to include accessibility-related topics in college level technology-based courses. In this paper  we present a study of the efficacy of short (10-minute) documentaries  created by student filmmakers  that portrayed three people with different disabilities. We evaluated the films with undergraduate and graduate students who were enrolled in technology-related courses to explore the films' abilities to raise awareness for concerns related to accessibility. We found that the films were effective at changing some incorrect assumptions about designing for diverse users and increasing recognition of the importance of designing for diversity.
LBW1816: Tangible Organs: Introducing 3D Printed Organ Models with VR to Interact with Medical 3D Models,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anke V. Reinschluessel  University of Bremen Thomas Muender  University of Bremen Verena Uslar  Pius-Hospital Oldenburg Dirk Weyhe  Pius-Hospital Oldenburg Andrea Schenk  Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Medicine MEVIS Rainer Malaka  University of Bremen,Medical images contain important information for diagnosis and preoperative planning in modern medicine. Interacting with these images still happens mostly with a mouse  abstract gestures or handles. In a focus group with five surgeons  we evaluate the possibilities of 3D printed organ models for interaction in VR for the use case of surgery planning. The surgeons rate the approach as highly useful and highlighted the advantage of easier grasping the space relations  which would greatly improve the planning phase of surgery.
LBW1817: Designing for Wellbeing-as-Interaction,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Shannon Rodgers  Queensland University of Technology Bernd Ploderer  Queensland University of Technology Brittany Maloney  Queensland University of Technology Jason Hang  Queensland University of Technology,This paper introduces the concept of wellbeing-as-interaction. Instead of designing and evaluating technologies that locate wellbeing in the individual  this paper presents early-stage work on designing technologies for people to collaboratively express  interpret  discuss and enact wellbeing. To explore this concept  we examined the wellbeing of six pairs of university students through a 7-day deployment of a technology probe 'MoodCloud'. MoodCloud consisted of a mobile app and an ambient display to share wellbeing updates through colour. We observed three patterns of wellbeing interactions: updates  follow-ups  and message chains. Wellbeing interactions benefitted from the ambiguity of colour and a clearly defined target audience  but students also communicated through other channels to make sense of updates and to enact support. The concept of wellbeing-as-interaction seeks to offer an analytic lens for the CHI community as well as inspiration for novel wellbeing technologies that emphasise meaningful interactions with friends.
LBW1818: in5: a Model for Inbodied Interaction,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,m.c. schraefel  University of Southampton,The human body is a complex system itself composed of complex systems; its state influences all aspects of our health  wellbeing including our cognitive to physical performance. In HCI most of us are not well versed in how this complex system works. The following paper proposes in5  a model to help make that physiology accessible for design. The model has two parts: (1) the MEECS dichotomies: five fundamental-to-life  volitional processes - move  eat  engage  cogitate  sleep - that are affected by parameters of quality  quantity  time and context  and (2) tuning: an approach to adjust the parameters of these dichotomies toward "dialing in" health  wellbeing  performance. The paper also offers examples for how this model can be explored for design research.
LBW1819: Designing Efficacious Mobile Technologies for Anxiety Self-Regulation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hashini Senaratne  Monash University Kirsten Ellis  Monash University Sharon Oviatt  Monash University Glenn Melvin  Monash University,This paper presents a step-by-step process that was developed primarily to extract design pre-requisites for personalized mobile technologies assisting anxiety self-regulation. This process  which is recognized as a preliminary framework  was developed  refined  and tested based on a multidisciplinary literature review and an exploratory study conducted with mental health professionals who treat anxiety disorders. The step-by-step nature of this framework draws from multiple disciplinary and stakeholder perspectives  integrates knowledge about efficacious psychological interventions  considers individual differences and specific challenges faced by patients  and realizes contextual needs. It also includes incremental and iterative refinements based on multidisciplinary sources to foster more evidence-based interface designs. Once reached its maturity  this framework can potentially be applied for designing efficacious technologies for a range of mental health conditions. The expected future contributions and limitations of the framework are also discussed.
LBW1820: A Preliminary Investigation of the Role of Anthropomorphism in Designing Telehealth Bots for Older Adults,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jaisie Sin  University of Toronto Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto Mississauga,Autonomous virtual agents (VAs) are increasingly used commercially in critical information spaces such as healthcare. Existing VA research has focused on microscale interaction patterns such as usability and artificial intelligence. However  the macroscale patterns of users' information practices and their relationship with the design and adoption of VAs have been largely understudied  especially when it comes to older adults (OAs)  who stand to benefit greatly from VAs. We conducted a preliminary investigation to understand the role design elements  such as anthropomorphic aspects of VAs  play in OAs' perception of VAs and in OAs' preferences for VAs' participation within their health information practices. Some unexpected findings indicate that the fidelity of anthropomorphic features influences perception in ways that are dependent on the context of the information tasks. This suggests that research on improving the design and increasing the adoption of VAs should factor the interplay between fidelity of VA representation and information context.
LBW2318: FlexPass: Symbiosis of Seamless User Authentication Schemes in IoT,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Marios Belk  University of Central Lancashire  Cyprus Campus Christos Fidas  University of Patras Andreas Pitsillides  University of Cyprus,This paper presents a new user authentication paradigm which is based on a flexible user authentication method  namely FlexPass. FlexPass relies on a single  user-selected secret that can be reflected in both textual and graphical authentication secrets. Such an approach facilitates adaptability in nowadays ubiquitous user interaction contexts within the Internet of Things (IoT)  in which end-users authenticate multiple times per day through a variety of interaction device types. We present an initial evaluation of the new authentication method based on an in-lab experiment with 32 participants. Analysis of results reveal that the FlexPass paradigm is memorable and that users like the adaptable perspective of the new approach. Findings are expected to scaffold the design of more user-centric knowledge-based authentication mechanisms within nowadays ubiquitous computation realms.

However  music theory is often considered as a non-interactive subject matter that requires huge efforts to understand. With this work  we contribute a novel tangible device  called ScaleDial  that makes use of the relations between geometry and music theory to provide interactive  graspable and playful learning experiences. Therefore  we introduce an innovative tangible cylinder and demonstrate how harmonic relationships can be explored through a physical set of digital manipulatives  that can be arranged and stacked on top of an interactive chromatic circle. Based on the tangible interaction and further rich visual and auditory output capabilities  ScaleDial enables a better understanding of scales  pitch constellations  triads  as well as intervals. Further  we describe the technical realization of our advanced prototype and show how we fabricate the magnetic  capacitive and mechanical sensing.
INT002: ClassBeacons: Enhancing Reflection-in-Action of Teachers through Spatially Distributed Ambient Information,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Pengcheng An  Eindhoven University of Technology Saskia Bakker  Eindhoven University of Technology Sara Ordanovski  Utrecht University Ruurd Taconis  Eindhoven University of Technology Chris L. E. Paffen  Utrecht University Berry Eggen  Eindhoven University of Technology,Reflection-in-action (RiA) refers to teachers' reflections on their teaching performance during busy classroom routines. RiA is a demanding competence for teachers  but little has been known about how HCI systems could support teachers' RiA during their busy and intensive teaching. To bridge this gap  we design and evaluate an ambient information system named ClassBeacons. ClassBeacons aims to help teachers intuitively reflect-in-action on how to divide time and attention over pupils throughout a lesson. ClassBeacons subtly depicts teachers' division of time and attention over pupils through multiple light-objects distributed over students' desks. Each light-object indicates how long the teacher has been cumulatively around it (helping an adjacent student) by shifting color. A field evaluation with eleven teachers proved that ClassBeacons enhanced teachers' RiA by supporting their sensemaking of ongoing performance and modification of upcoming actions. Furthermore  ClassBeacons was experienced to unobtrusively fit into teachers' routines without overburdening teaching in progress.

This capability has been exploited to create displays since being able to position mid-air physical voxels enables for rich data representations. However  most of the times interesting features of acoustic levitation are not exploited. Acoustic Levitation is harmless and sound diffracts around objects  thus we can insert our hand inside the levitator and touch the levitated particles without harmful effect on us. In this demo  we showcase more tangible interactions with acoustically levitated particles by passing acoustically-transparent structures through the particles  manipulating particles in mid-air with wearable levitators or by moving multiple particles with direct manipulation. We hope that this demo provides a more tangible experience of acoustic levitation. Since all the presented devices are Do-It-Yourself  we encourage visitors to experiment further with acoustic levitation.

Like in other sports  proper training leads to a faster increase of skill and lessens the risk of injuries. We chose a set of exercises from slackline literature and implemented an interactive trainer which guides the user through the exercises giving feedback if the exercises were executed correctly. Based on lessons learned from our study and prior demonstrations we present a revised version of Slackliner that uses head tracking to better guide the user's attention and movements. Additionally a new visual indicator informs the trainee about her arm posture during the performance. This has been also included in an updated post-analysis view that provides the trainee with more detailed feedback about her performance. The present demo showcases an interactive sports training system that provides in-situ feedback while following a well-guided learning procedure.

The key idea is to cut and perforate a 2D sheet using a cutting plotter to make it foldable into a 3D honeycomb structure; before folding  users place the electronic components and circuitry onto the sheet. The fabrication process only takes a few minutes allowing to rapidly prototype functional interactive devices. The resulting objects are lightweight and rigid  thus allowing for weight-sensitive and force-sensitive applications. Due to the nature of honeycombs  the created objects can be folded flat along one axis and thus can be efficiently transported in this compact form factor.
INT016: Demonstrating Kyub: A 3D Editor for Modeling Sturdy Laser-Cut Objects,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Patrick Baudisch  Hasso Plattner Institute Arthur Silber  Hasso Plattner Institute Yannis Kommana  Hasso Plattner Institute Milan Gruner  Hasso Plattner Institute Ludwig Wall  Hasso Plattner Institute Kevin Reuss  Hasso Plattner Institute Lukas Heilmann  Hasso-Plattner-Institut Robert Kovacs  Hasso Plattner Institute Daniel Rechlitz  Hasso Plattner Institute Thijs Roumen  Hasso Plattner Institute,We present an interactive editing system for laser cutting called kyub. Kyub allows users to create models efficiently in 3D  which it then unfolds into the 2D plates laser cutters expect. Unlike earlier systems  such as FlatFitFab  kyub affords construction based on closed box structures  which allows users to turn very thin material  such as 4mm plywood  into objects capable of withstanding large forces  such as chairs users can actually sit on. To afford such sturdy construction  every kyub project begins with a simple finger-joint "boxel"—a structure we found to be capable of withstanding over 500kg of load. Users then extend their model by attaching additional boxels. Boxels merge automatically  resulting in larger  yet equally strong structures. While the concept of stacking boxels allows kyub to offer the strong affordance and ease of use of a voxel-based editor  boxels are not confined to a grid and readily combine with kuyb's various geometry deformation tools. In our technical evaluation  objects built with kyub withstood hundreds of kilograms of loads. We demonstrate the kyub software to the CHI audience and allow them to experience the resulting models first hand.
INT017: Digital Fabrication of Soft Actuated Objects by Machine Knitting,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lea Albaugh  Carnegie Mellon University Scott Hudson  Carnegie Mellon University Lining Yao  Carnegie Mellon University,With recent interest in shape-changing interfaces  material-driven design  wearable technologies  and soft robotics  digital fabrication of soft actuatable material is increasingly in demand. Much of this research focuses on elastomers or non-stretchy air bladders. In this work  we explore a series of design strategies for machine knitting actuated soft objects by integrating tendons with shaping and anisotropic texture design.
INT018: Painting with CATS: Camera-Aided Texture Synthesis,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ticha Sethapakdi  Carnegie Mellon University James McCann  Carnegie Mellon University,We present CATS  a digital painting system that synthesizes textures from live video in real-time  short-cutting the typical brush- and texture- gathering workflow. Through the use of boundary-aware texture synthesis  CATS produces strokes that are non-repeating and blend smoothly with each other. This allows CATS to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. We evaluated the effectiveness of CATS by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that CATS is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings.
INT019: Flowboard: A Visual Flow-Based Programming Environment for Embedded Coding,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anke Brocker  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Tony Zelun Zhang  RWTH Aachen University Mathis Müller  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,With Maker-friendly environments like the Arduino IDE  embedded programming has become an important part of STEM education. But learning embedded programming is still hard  requiring both coding and basic electronics skills. To understand if a different programming paradigm can help  we developed Flowboard  which uses Flow-Based Programming (FBP) rather than the usual imperative programming paradigm. Instead of command sequences  learners assemble processing nodes into a graph through which signals and data flow. Flowboard consists of a visual flow-based editor on an iPad  a hardware frame integrating the iPad  an Arduino board and two breadboards next to the iPad  letting learners connect their visual graphs seamlessly to the input and output electronics. Graph edits take effect immediately  making Flowboard a live coding environment.
INT020: Live Programming By Example,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mark Santolucito  Yale University William T. Hallahan  Yale University Ruzica Piskac  Yale University,Live programming is a novel approach for programming practice. Programmers are given real-time feedback when writing code  traditionally via a graphical user interface. Despite live programming's practical values  such as providing an easier overview of code and better understanding of its structure  it is not yet widely used. In this work  we extend live programming to general purpose code editors  which allows for live programming to be used by programmers  and provides new interfaces for understanding and changing the functionality of code. To achieve this we extended a fully-featured IDE with the ability to show input/output examples of code execution  as the programmer is writing code. Furthermore  we integrate programming by example (PBE) synthesis into our tool by allowing the user to change the shown output  and have the code update automatically. Our goal is to use live programming to give novice programmers a new way to interact and understand programming  as well as being a useful development tool for more advanced programmers.
INT021: Dynamic Depth-of-Field Projection for 3D Projection Mapping,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lihui Wang  University of Tokyo Hongjin Xu  University of Tokyo Yunpu Hu  University of Tokyo Satoshi Tabata  University of Tokyo Masatoshi Ishikawa  University of Tokyo,Demonstration for a dynamic depth-of-field projection mapping on a 3D moving object would be performed. Conventional projection mapping was limited on 2D space  due to their narrow depth-of-field projection range. Our system included a high-speed projector  a high-speed variable focus lens  a depth sensor by a stereo camera  so that the depth information would be detected and then served as feedback to correct the focal length of the projection. As a result  a projection mapping would be well-focused projected on a 3D dynamic moving object.
INT022: Demonstration of Springlets: Expressive  Flexible and Silent On-Skin Tactile Interfaces,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Nur Al-huda Hamdan  RWTH Aachen University Adrian Wagner  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University Jürgen Steimle  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus,We present Springlets  expressive  non-vibrating mechanotactile interfaces on the skin. Embedded with shape memory alloy springs  we implement Springlets as thin and flexible stickers to be worn on various body locations  thanks to their silent operation even on the neck and head. We present a technically simple and rapid technique for fabricating a wide range of Springlet interfaces. We developed six modular Springlets: a pincher  a directional stretcher  a presser  a puller  a dragger  and an expander (Fig. 1). In our hands-on demonstration  we show our modular Springlets and several Springlet interfaces for tactile social communication  physical guidance  health interfaces  navigation  and virtual reality gaming. Attendees can wear the interfaces and explore their expressive variable force profiles and spatiotemporal patterns.
INT023: A Sensing Technique for Data Glove Using Conductive Fiber,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ryosuke Takada  University of Tsukuba Junichiro Kadomoto  The Univesity of Tokyo Buntarou Shizuki  University of Tsukuba,We demonstrate a sensing technique for data gloves using conductive fiber. This technique enables us to estimate hand shapes (bend of a finger and contact between fingers) and differentiates a grabbing tag. To estimate how far each finger bends  the electrical resistance of the conductive fiber is measured; this resistance decreases as the finger bends because the surface of the glove short circuits. To detect contact between fingers  we apply alternating currents with different frequencies to each finger and measure the signal propagation between the fingers. This principle is also used to differentiate a grabbing tag (each tag has an alternating current with a unique frequency). We developed a prototype data glove based on this technique.
INT024: LUNE: Representing Lunar Day by Displayed Lighting Object,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sung ho Lee  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Seong beom Kim  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Byoung hern Kim  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Hui sung Lee  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,LUNE is a displayed lighting object representing time. It provides real-time lighting visualized moon phase. People can recognize the date of month through abstract image of moon. This product was developed to investigate the use of metaphor from lighting to represent time. A diverse set of researches and design initiatives related to time  temporality and slowness has emerged in the DIS and HCI communities. An important area of work is to represent time. The primary objective of this research is to suggest the new perspective of time called sense of time. First  we can understand how people perceive the time and we can also trace recent research related to perspectives of time in HCI. Second  we designed artifacts and investigated the use of moon phase as material to represent time in a new approach.
INT025: Bear & Co: Simulating Value Conflicts in IoT Development,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Annelie Berner  Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design Monica Seyfried  Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design Calle Nordenskjöld  Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design Peter Kuhberg  Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design Irina Shklovski  IT University of Copenhagen,Bear & Co. is a fictitious immersion into the world of being part of an IOT start-up. We invite visitors to join the company  and facilitate their journey through various ethical conundrums  as they become part of the company. First  they must state their values - what they will bring to the company and care most about. Then  we test those values through different scenarios and problems that are unexpected and that do not have easy answers. Finally  we debrief our visitors and invite them to peruse explanations for various ethical approaches presented as maps and diagrams  where they can interrogate their own decisions against three different philosophical viewpoints.
INT026: An Exploration of Responsive and Emotive Wearables through Research Prototyping,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Rain Ashford  Goldsmiths  University of London,Responsive and Emotive wearables are concerned with the visualisation of environmental and physiological data. Four research prototypes were created for doctoral research to investigate the possibility that wearable technology could be used to create new forms of nonverbal communication using physiological data from the wearer's body. The research investigated who the audience might be for these research prototypes and their concerns and requirements. Through a lens of how these artifacts might they be used in social or formal contexts  the research gathered data from fifty potential users of emotive wearables and examined the usage and user preferences of such devices. Findings reflected the concerns of potential users from aesthetics and functionality to ethical and privacy issues.

This interactive artwork is experienced through the HTC Vive headset  with movement and touch key elements to the aesthetic of this work. It combines both a physical and a digital sculpture and in doing so creates a mixed reality that plays on a disconnect between what we can see and what we can feel.
INT028: Hypercept: Speculating the Visual World Intervened by Digital Media,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jiabao Li  Harvard Graduate School of Design Honghao Deng  Harvard Graduate School of Design Panagiotis Michalatos  Harvard Graduate School of Design,Human perception has long been influenced by technological breakthroughs. An intimate mediation of technology lies in between our direct perceptions and the environment we perceive. Through three extreme ideal types of perceptual machines  this project defamiliarizes and questions the habitual ways in which we interpret  operate  and understand the visual world intervened by digital media. The three machines create: Hyper-sensitive vision – a speculation on social media's amplification effect and our filtered communication landscape. Hyper-focused vision – an analogue version of the searching behavior on the Internet. Hyper-commoditized vision – monetized vision that meditates on the omnipresent advertisement targeted all over our visual field. The site of intervention is the visual field in a technologically augmented society. All the three machines have both internal state and external signal.

INT030: Come Hither to Me: Performance of a Seductive Robot,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sahar Sajadieh  University of California  Santa Barbara Hannah Wolfe  University of California  Santa Barbara,Come Hither to Me is an interactive robotic performance  which examines the emotive social interaction between an audience and a robot. Our interactive robot attempts to communicate and flirt with audience members in the gallery. The robot uses feedback from sensors  auditory data  and computer vision techniques to learn about the participants and inform its conversation. The female robot approaches the audience  picks her favorites  and starts charming them with seductive comments  funny remarks  backhanded compliments  and personal questions. We are interested in evoking emotions in the participating audience through their interactions with the robot. Come Hither to Me strives to invert gender roles and stereotypical expectations in flirtatious interactions. This performative piece explores the dynamics of social communication  objectification of women  and the gamification of seduction. The robot reduces flirtation to an algorithm  codifying pick-up lines and sexting paradigms.
INT031: Eyes: Iris Sonification and Interactive Biometric Art,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yoon Chung Han  San Jose State University Praful Surve  California State University  Fullerton,"Eyes" is an interactive biometric data art that transforms human's Iris data into musical sound and 3D animated image. The idea is to allow the audience to explore their own identities through unique visual and sound generated by their iris patterns based on iris recognition and image processing techniques. Selected iris images are printed in 3D sculptures  and it replays the sound and animated images on the sculptures. This research-based artwork has an experimental system generating distinct sounds for each different iris data using visual features such as colors  patterns  brightness and size of the iris. It has potentials to lead the new way of interpreting complicated dataset with the audiovisual output. Moreover  aesthetically beautiful  mesmerizing and uncanny valley-effected artwork can create personalized art experience and multimodal interaction. Multisensory interpretations of this data art can lead a new opportunity to reveal users' narratives and create their own "sonic signature."

It allows the audience to experience their unique data-driven artificial life form - dandelion as embodied and possessed through their facial features  heartbeat signal  and emotion expression in artistic expression.
INT033: Death Ground,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Christos Michalakos  Abertay University Bernt Isak Wærstad  Norwegian University of Science and Technology,Death Ground is a competitive musical installation-game for two players. The work is designed to provide the framework for the players/participants in which to perform game-mediated musical gestures against each-other. The main mechanic involves destroying the other player's avatar by outmaneuvering and using audio weapons and improvised musical actions against it. These weapons are spawned in an enclosed area during the performance and can be used by whoever is collects them first. There is a multitude of such power-ups  all of which have different properties  such as speed boost  additional damage  ground traps and so on. All of these weapons affect the sound and sonic textures that each of the avatars produce. Additionally  the players can use elements of the environment such as platforms  obstructions and elevation in order to gain competitive advantage  or position themselves strategically to access first the spawned power-ups.
INT034: Keycube is a Kind of Keyboard (k^(3)),Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Damien Brun  Université TÉLUQ Charles Gouin-Vallerand  Université TÉLUQ Sébastien George  Le Mans Université,Alternate realities through headsets  such as augmented  mixed and virtual reality are becoming part of people's everyday life. Except in some limited context  usual keyboards are inappropriate for such technological medium and alternative interfaces for text-entry must be explored. In this paper we present the keycube  a general-purpose cubic handheld device that goes beyond the text-entry interface by including multiple keys  a touch-screen  an inertial unit with six degrees-of-freedom and a vibrotactile feedback. Strong of its form factor and affordance  the keycube offers advantages with regards to mobility  comfort  learnability  privacy and playfulness. Thus  the combination creates a novel text-entry interface convenient for many use cases across the whole reality-virtuality continuum.

We built a computational perception model using a data-driven approach from the collected data pairs of mass properties and perceived shapes. This enables Transcalibur to easily and effectively provide convincing shape perception based on complex illusory effects. Our user study showed that the system succeeded in providing the perception of various desired shapes in a virtual environment. In the demonstration  users can explore VR application that can feel the sensation of wielding sword  shield and crossbow and with these fight with a dragon.
INT036: VRChairRacer: Using an Office Chair Backrest as a Locomotion Technique for VR Racing Games,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Julius von Willich  TU Darmstadt Dominik Schön  TU Darmstadt Sebastian Günther  TU Darmstadt Florian Müller  TU Darmstadt Max Mühlhäuser  TU Darmstadt Markus Funk  TU Darmstadt,Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) is an important topic as there is a mismatch between the size of a Virtual Environment and the physically available tracking space. Although many locomotion techniques have been proposed  research on VR locomotion has not concluded yet. In this demonstration  we contribute to the area of VR locomotion by introducing VRChairRacer. VRChairRacer presents a novel mapping the velocity of a racing cart on the backrest of an office chair. Further  it maps a users' rotation onto the steering of a virtual racing cart. VRChairRacer demonstrates this locomotion technique to the community through an immersive multiplayer racing demo.

Through immersive game-play on the Oculus Rift  users explore Spanish translations of everyday household items in a search-and-find format  scoring points when they can correctly identify and select objects. Users are able to put what they learn into practice in real time. Study participants who tried the experience said they found this method of language learning to be more enjoyable than traditional methods of studying due to the gamification created and it not "feeling like studying". As virtual reality headsets continue to become more accessible to the public  addresses the cost limitations of traveling overseas to achieve immersion in foreign language. This application can be expanded to most real-world scenarios and locations. Additionally  it can be applied to any language.
INT040: Experiencing a Mirrored World with Geotagged Social Media in Geollery,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ruofei Du  University of Maryland  College Park David Li  University of Maryland  College Park Amitabh Varshney  University of Maryland  College Park,We demonstrate the online deployment of Geollery  a mixed reality social media platform. We introduce an interactive pipeline to reconstruct a mirrored world at two levels of detail - the street level and the bird's-eye view. Instead of using offline 3D reconstruction approaches  our system streams and renders a mirrored world in real time  while depicting geotagged social media as billboards  balloons  framed photos  and virtual gifts. Geollery allows multiple users to see  chat  and collaboratively sketch with spatial context in this mirrored world. We demonstrate a wide range of use cases including crowdsourced tourism  interactive audio guide with immersive spatial context  and meeting remote friends in mixed reality. We envision Geollery will be inspiring and useful as a standalone social media platform for those looking to explore new areas or looking to share their experiences. Please refer to https://geollery.com for the paper and live demos.
INT041: Egocentric Smaller-person Experience through a Change in Visual Perspective,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jun Nishida  University of Chicago Soichiro Matsuda  University of Tsukuba Mika Oki  University of Tsukuba Hikaru Takatori  University of Tsukuba Kosuke Sato  University of Tsukuba Kenji Suzuki  University of Tsukuba,This paper explores how human perceptions  actions  and interactions can be changed through an embodied and active experience of being a smaller person in a real-world environment  which we call an egocentric smaller person experience. We developed a wearable visual translator that provides the perspective of a smaller person by shifting the wearer's eyesight level down to their waist using a head-mounted display and a stereo camera module  while allowing for field of view control through head movements. In this study  we investigated how the developed device can modify the wearer's body representation and experiences based on a field study conducted at a nursing school and museums  and through lab studies. Using this device  designers and teachers can understand the perspectives of a smaller-person including a child in an existing environment.

INT044: Multisensory Virtual Environment for Fire Evacuation Training,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tommy Nilsson  University of Nottingham Tessa Roper  University of Nottingham Emily Shaw  University of Nottingham Glyn Lawson  University of Nottingham Sue V. G. Cobb  University of Nottingham Hsieh Meng-Ko  University of Nottingham Daniel Miller  University of Nottingham James Khan  University of Nottingham,Growing organizational safety awareness is propelling the interest in development of novel solutions for fire training. Significant effort in this area has previously gone into designing various immersive virtual reality (VR) systems in hopes of enabling safe exploration and experiencing the consequences of ones actions in scenarios that would be too hazardous in the real life. Yet  the fact that VR generally lacks the sensory feedback of a real life fire situation has been found to impede a sense of realism and validity of such experiences. As part of our efforts to mitigate this issue  we now present a new prototype fire evacuation simulator designed to deliver not just audiovisual feedback  but likewise real-time heat and scent stimulation.
INT045: 3D Positional Movement Interaction with User-Defined  Virtual Interface for Music Software: MoveMIDI,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Timothy Arterbury  Baylor University G. Michael Poor  Baylor University,This paper describes progress made in design and development of a new digital musical instrument (MIDI controller)  MoveMIDI  and highlights its unique 3D positional movement interaction design differing from recent orientational and gestural approaches. A user constructs and interacts with MoveMIDI's virtual  3D interface using handheld position-tracked controllers to control music software  as well as non-musical technology such as stage lighting. MoveMIDI's virtual interface contributes to solving problems difficult to solve with hardware MIDI controller interfaces such as customized positioning and instantiation of interface elements  and accurate  simultaneous control of independent parameters. MoveMIDI's positional interaction mirrors interaction with some physical acoustic instruments and provides visualization for an audience. Beta testers of MoveMIDI have created emergent use cases for the instrument.
INT046: Are Drones Meditative?,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Joseph La Delfa  RMIT University Mehmet Aydin Baytas  Qualisys AB Olivia Wichtowski  RMIT University Rohit Ashok Khot  RMIT University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University,Meditative movement involves regulating attention to the body whilst moving  to create a state of meditation. This can be difficult for beginners  we propose that drones can facilitate this as they can move with and give feedback to whole body movements. We present a demonstration that explores various ways drones could facilitate meditative movement by drawing attention to the body. We designed a two-handed control map for the drone that engages multiple parts of the body  a light foam casing to give the impression that the drone is floating and an onboard light which gives feedback to the speed of the movement. The user will experience both leading and following the drone to explore the interplay between mapping  form  feedback and instruction. The demonstration relates to an expansion of the attention regulation framework  which is used to inform the design of interactive meditative experiences and human-drone interactions.
INT047: iScream!: Towards the Design of Playful Gustosonic Experiences with Ice Cream,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yan Wang  RMIT University Zhuying Li  RMIT University Robert Jarvis  RMIT University Rohit Ashok Khot  RMIT University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University,In this demonstration  we present iScream!  a novel gustosonic experience that generates unique digital sounds as a result of eating ice cream. The system uses capacitive sensing to detect eating actions and based on these actions  it plays out six different playful sounds to facilitate a playful eating experience. Our aim is to support a playful way of eating because we believe that interactive technology offers unique opportunities to facilitate novel engaging eating experiences. Ultimately  with this work  we aim to inspire and guide designers working with interactive playful gustosonic experiences  which open up new interaction possibilities to experience eating as play.

It was pilot tested in a school among 16 primary schoolchildren. The results show that the installation encourages schoolchildren to synchronise their movement through play. The installation matches CHI 2019 theme of weaving the threads of CHI and playing the game at CHI symbolises the Celtic knot logo of strength and friendship.
INT049: Movie+: Towards Exploring Social Effects of Emotional Fingerprints for Video Clips and Movies,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anton Fedosov  Università della Svizzera italiana Bianca Stancu  Università della Svizzera italiana Elena Di Lascio  Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) Davide Eynard  Università della Svizzera italiana Marc Langheinrich  Faculty of Computer Science,Collaborative movie viewing with the loved ones increases connectedness and social bonds within family members and friends. Furthermore  with the rapid adoption of personal mobile devices  people often engage in this activity being geographically separated. However  conveying our feelings and emotions about a recently watched movie or a video clip is often limited to a post on social media or a short blurb on an instant messaging app. Drawing on the popular interest in quantified-self  which envisioned one collecting and sharing biophysical information from everyday routines (e.g.  workouts)  we have designed and developed Movie+  a mobile application  which utilizes personal biophysical data to construct an individual's "emotional fingerprint" while viewing a video clip. Movie+ allows the selective sharing of this information through different visualization options  as well as rendering others' emotional fingerprints over the same clip. In this submission  we outline the design rationale and briefly describe our application prototype.
INT050: PhotoFlow in Action: Picture-Mediated Reminiscence Supporting Family Socio-Connectivity,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Benett Axtell  University of Toronto Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto & University of Toronto Mississauga,Family connections are maintained through sharing reminiscences  often supported by family photographs which easily prompt memories. This is increasingly important as we age  as picture-based reminiscence has been shown to reduce older adults' social isolation. However  there is a gap between sharing memories from physical pictures and the limited support for oral social reminiscence afforded by digital tools. PhotoFlow supports older adults' picture-mediated social storytelling of family memories using an intuitive metaphor mirroring sharing physical family pictures on a table top. The app uses the speech of oral storytelling to automatically organize pictures based only on what has been said. This simplifies the overall process of family picture interactions by leveraging one enjoyable aspect to ease a more effortful one. In particular  the familiar table top interaction metaphor has the potential to bridge the gap between physical picture reminiscence and managing digital picture collections.
Empowering Expression for Users with Aphasia through Constrained Creativity,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Timothy Neate  City  University of London Abi Roper  City  University of London Stephanie Wilson  City  University of London Jane Marshall  City  University of London,Creative activities allow people to express themselves in rich  nuanced ways. However  being creative does not always come easily. For example  people with speech and language impairments  such as aphasia  face challenges in creative activities that involve language. In this paper  we explore the concept of constrained creativity as a way of addressing this challenge and enabling creative writing. We report an app  MakeWrite  that supports the constrained creation of digital texts through automated redaction. The app was co-designed with and for people with aphasia and was subsequently explored in a workshop with a group of people with aphasia. Participants were not only successful in crafting novel language  but  importantly  self-reported that the app was crucial in enabling them to do so. We refect on the potential of technology-supported constrained creativity as a means of empowering expression amongst users with diverse needs.
LBW2810: Minimalistic Explanations: Capturing the Essence of Decisions,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Martin Schuessler  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut Philipp Weiß  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut,The use of complex machine learning models can make systems opaque to users. Machine learning research proposes the use of post-hoc explanations. However  it is unclear if they give users insights into otherwise uninterpretable models. One minimalistic way of explaining image classifications by a deep neural network is to show only the areas that were decisive for the assignment of a label. In a pilot study  20 participants looked at 14 of such explanations generated either by a human or the LIME algorithm. For explanations of correct decisions  they identified the explained object with significantly higher accuracy (75.64 % vs. 18.52 %). We argue that this shows that explanations can be very minimalistic while retaining the essence of a decision  but the decision-making contexts that can be conveyed in this manner is limited. Finally  we found that explanations are unique to the explainer and human-generated explanations were assigned 79 % higher trust ratings. As a starting point for further studies  this work shares our first insights into quality criteria of post-hoc explanations.
ForceRay: Extending Thumb Reach via Force Input Stabilizes Device Grip for Mobile Touch Input,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Christian Corsten  RWTH Aachen University Marcel Lahaye  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University,Smartphones are used predominantly one-handed  using the thumb for input. Many smartphones  however  have grown beyond 5". Users cannot tap everywhere on these screens without destabilizing their grip. ForceRay (FR) lets users aim at an out-of-reach target by applying a force touch at a comfortable thumb location  casting a virtual ray towards the target. Varying pressure moves a cursor along the ray. When reaching the target  quickly lifting the thumb selects it. In a first study  FR was 195 ms slower and had a 3% higher selection error than the best existing technique  BezelCursor (BC)  but FR caused significantly less device movement than all other techniques  letting users maintain a steady grip and removing their concerns about device drops. A second study showed that an hour of training speeds up both BC and FR  and that both are equally fast for targets at the screen border.
ReType: Quick Text Editing with Keyboard and Gaze,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Shyamli Sindhwani  University of Auckland Christof Lutteroth  University of Bath Gerald Weber  University of Auckland,When a user needs to reposition the cursor during text editing  this is often done using the mouse. For experienced typists especially  the switch between keyboard and mouse can slow down the keyboard editing workflow considerably. To address this we propose ReType  a new gaze-assisted positioning technique combining keyboard with gaze input based on a new 'patching' metaphor. ReType allows users to perform some common editing operations while keeping their hands on the keyboard. We present the result of two studies. A free-use study indicated that ReType enhances the user experience of text editing. ReType was liked by many participants  regardless of their typing skills. A comparative user study showed that ReType is able to match or even beat the speed of mouse-based interaction for small text edits. We conclude that the gaze-augmented user interface can make common interactions more fluent  especially for professional keyboard users.
SRC01: Can Changes in Heart Rate Variability Represented in Sound be Identified by Non-Medical Experts?,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mariam Bahameish  Queen Mary University of London,Heart rate variability (HRV) has become a wide-spread area for the investigation of the health and stress states of individuals. This paper aims at exploring the effectiveness of representing HRV measures with alternative modalities  other than visual displays  such as audio or haptics. Therefore  we undertook a preliminary study in which we applied a parameter mapping sonification approach to transform the HRV signal into an audible form. In this work  we sought to evaluate the human perception of the developed auditory interface. Hence  a dataset that involves interbeat interval measurements of individuals experiencing changes in mental state in the form of meditation was selected as the basis of the study. The HRV parameters of the dataset were mapped to acoustic features using a linear mapping technique. The feasibility of the system was assessed by measuring the learnability  performance  latency  and confidence aspects. The results suggest a great potential of incorporating auditory displays in the analysis of HRV. Participants were able to distinguish the different meditation states and types with minimal training time. However  further studies should be conducted on a larger population to provide verification of the findings of this preliminary study.
SRC02: Muse: Scaffolding Metacognitive Reflection in Design-Based Research,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Victoria Cabales  Northwestern University,While learning science research has explored approaches improving students' problem solving skills by introducing tools that support students in metacognitive reflection  this work has focused on problems with clear solutions  rather than addressing the question of how metacognitive reflection can help students develop their self-regulation skills  which help students understand and control their learning environment through planning  practice  and self-evaluation. This paper presents Muse  an in-action chatbot interface that prompts students to reflect metacognitively on their self-direction process in the midst of working on their independent research projects. Students participate in the Design  Technology  and Research (DTR) program  which provides several undergrads the opportunity to self-direct an independent research project by using the socio-technological model Agile Research Studios (ARS). Results from a case study suggest that Muse helps students identify time consuming habits and set aside less important tasks by giving participants the opportunity to act on their reflections and adjust aspects of their process that they deem less effective.
SRC03: Guidelines for Combining Storytelling and Gamification: Which Features Would Teenagers Desire to Have a More Enjoyable Museum Experience?,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Vanessa Cesário  University of Porto & Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute,While museums are often designed to engage and interest a wide variety of audiences  teenagers are a neglected segment. This PhD research in Digital Media explores how digital technologies can facilitate natural history museums in creating immersive museum experiences for teenagers (15–18 years old)  especially through digital storytelling and gamification frameworks. This contribution would be a set of guidelines that will aid in designing interactive experiences inside these museums. So far  we have involved a total of 155 teens through co-design sessions  130 in focus groups  and 98 in usability studies  as well as 3 museums  12 curators  and 17 master students. Through qualitative analysis  our preliminary findings suggest that teenagers value gamification and storytelling elements when thinking about enjoyable museum tours  while curators value story-based narratives as the most prominent method to provide enjoyable museum experience for teens. Based on the findings identified  and in collaboration with the Madeira-ITI  two interactive mobile experiences targeted at teenagers were developed for the Natural History Museum of Funchal  Portugal.
SRC04: Understanding the Occupational Therapists Method to Inform the Design of Technologies for People with Dementia,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Emma Dixon  University of Maryland  College Park,This paper describes a PhD research project involving people with dementia and practitioners who work primarily with people with dementia to support engagement in meaningful activities and activities of everyday living. The aim of this work is to develop a technology which adapts to changing cognitive demands of people with dementia in order to facilitate continuous engagement in meaningful activities. In depth  semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners to understand their methods for personalization of activities and the implications for design of future adaptive technologies. Preliminary results from interviews with Occupational Therapists are presented.
SRC05: Lake: A Digital Wizard of Oz Prototyping Tool,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Andrew Finke  Northwestern University,Mobile app designers aim to develop the best mobile software interfaces in the least amount of time  and rely on testing ideas with prototypes in lieu of building costly  fully functioning applications. Yet  designers cannot effectively prototype some complex app experiences  including augmented reality applications like Pokémon GO  because existing tools lack the needed features  or because prototyping in them is too time intensive to be feasible. To solve this problem  we introduce Lake  a mobile application prototyping tool that enables the creation of complex mobile applications with the same ease as paper prototyping. By leveraging the Wizard of Oz technique used in paper prototyping in our digital medium  we enable designers to prototype at the same low cost as paper  but at a much higher fidelity. Through a pilot study (N=6)  we find that designers are able to gather organic in-context feedback from complex prototypes made with Lake.
SRC06: Automatic Speech Recognition Services: Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Usability,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Abraham Glasser  Rochester Institute of Technology,Nowadays  speech is becoming a more common  if not standard  interface to technology. This can be seen in the trend of technology changes over the years. Increasingly  voice is used to control programs  appliances and personal devices within homes  cars  workplaces  and public spaces through smartphones and home assistant devices using Amazon's Alexa  Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri  and other proliferating technologies. However  most speech interfaces are not accessible for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) people. In this paper  performances of current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with voices of DHH speakers are evaluated. ASR has improved over the years  and is able to reach Word Error Rates (WER) as low as 5-6% [1][2][3]  with the help of cloud-computing and machine learning algorithms that take in custom vocabulary models. In this paper  a custom vocabulary model is used  and the significance of the improvement is evaluated when using DHH speech.
SRC07: Affordable Smart Wheelchair,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Isabella Gomez Torres  University of California  San Diego Gaurav Parmar  University of California  San Diego Sammarth Aggarwal  University of California  San Diego Nathaniel Mansur  University of California  San Diego Alec Guthrie  University California  San Diego,Power wheelchairs (PW) are an example of an assistive technology in that they are used to increase  maintain  or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities [6]. As seen in [5] [3]  the commercially available products do not provide any assistance beyond enhanced mobility. Furthermore  existing PW research fails at comprehensively noting an individual's challenges  such as navigating through narrow passages or fixing their broken wheelchairs. Instead  they focus mostly on novel interaction methods such as BCI  head and gaze control [9] [15]. In this paper  we explore these individual needs and show that PWs have the novel potential to become a smart wheelchair at an affordable price. Our research follows the double diamond (DD) process [2] and relies on the participatory design (PD) methodology [7]  which addresses all stakeholders involved. Namely  we consider individuals with wheelchairs  the assistive technology research community  and the PW industry. For further insight we also contacted medical doctors  healthcare professionals  and non- profit organizations. We spent time getting to know these communities through interviews  surveys  demonstrations  and continuous user inputs  aligning our work to the PD tools. We found that individuals using wheelchairs overall desire safety  accessibility  and a durable design. Guided by these results  we designed a proof of concept (POC) system called the Affordable Smart Wheelchair (ASW) for indoor use. This kit implements full-autonomy in the form of indoor navigation from one room to another and to predetermined docking locations through voice control. It also has semi-autonomous functions in the form of manual joystick control augmented with real-time collision avoidance and staircase detection.
SRC08: Math Graphs for the Visually Impaired: Audio Presentation of Elements of Mathematical Graphs,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jeongyeon Kim  Sogang University Yoonah Lee  Sogang University Inho Seo  Sogang University,The sense of sight takes a dominating role in learning mathematical graphs. Most visually impaired students drop out of mathematics because necessary content is inaccessible. Sonification and auditory graphs have been the primary methods of representing data through sound. However  the representation of mathematical elements of graphs is still unexplored. The experiments in this paper investigate optimal methods for representing mathematical elements of graphs with sound. The results indicate that the methods of design in this study are effective for describing mathematical elements of graphs  such as axes  quadrants and differentiability. These findings can help visually impaired learners to be more independent  and also facilitate further studies on assistive technology.
SRC09: I Am What You Eat: Effects of Social Influence on Meal Selection Online,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 10:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Maria D. Molina  Pennsylvania State University,The availability of mHealth technologies has increased exponentially  particularly fitness and calorie tracking applications. Recent studies and anecdotal evidence has highlighted the potential of these technologies to serve as tools of bad eating behavior due to its focus on self-monitoring and calorie counting. The current research investigates on the potential of using social-orienting features of technology  specifically bandwagon and identity cues  to incentivize food-based nutrition (FBN) rather than a calorie-only approach. For this purpose  a 2 x 2 mixed factorial online experiment was conducted with bandwagon cue as a within-subject factor and identity cue as a between-subject factor. Results reveal that 67.6% of participants selected high bandwagon cue meals  regardless of its nutritional value. Bandwagon perception was the only significant predictor of meal selection  indicating that an increase in one unit improved the odds of an individual choosing a high bandwagon meal by 69%.

We explore whether paid crowdsourcing can be inclusive of individuals in rural India  who are relatively new to digital devices and literate mainly in local languages. We built an Android application to measure the accuracy with which participants can digitize handwritten Marathi/Hindi words. The tasks were based on the real-world need for digitizing handwritten Devanagari script documents. Results from a two-week  mixed-methods study show that participants achieved 96.7% accuracy in digitizing handwritten words on low-end smartphones. A crowdsourcing platform that employs these users performs comparably to a professional transcription firm. Participants showed overwhelming enthusiasm for completing tasks  so much so that we recommend imposing limits to prevent overuse of the application. We discuss the implications of these results for crowdsourcing in low-resource areas.
ElasticVR: Providing Multilevel Continuously-Changing Resistive Force and Instant Impact Using Elasticity for VR,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Hsin-Ruey Tsai  National Taiwan University & University of Tokyo Jun Rekimoto  University of Tokyo Bing-Yu Chen  National Taiwan University,Resistive force (e.g.  due to object elasticity) and impact (e.g.  due to recoil) are common effects in our daily life. However  resistive force continuously changes due to users' movements while impact instantly occurs when an event triggers it. These feedback are still not realistically provided by current VR haptic methods. In this paper  a wearable device  ElasticVR  which consists of an elastic band  servo motors and mechanical brakes  is proposed to provide the continuously-changing resistive force and instantly-occurring impact upon the user's hand to enhance VR realism. By changing two physical properties  length and extension distance  of the elastic band  ElasticVR provides multilevel resistive force with no delay and impact with little delay  respectively  for realistic and versatile VR applications. A force perception study was performed to observe users' force distinguishability of the resistive force and impact  and the prototype was built based on its results. A VR experience study further proves that the resistive force and impact from ElasticVR both outperform those from current approaches in realism. Applications using ElasticVR are also demonstrated.
VRsneaky: Increasing Presence in VR Through Gait-Aware Auditory Feedback,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Matthias Hoppe  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Jakob Karolus  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Felix Dietz  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Paweł W. Woźniak  Utrecht University Albrecht Schmidt  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Tonja Machulla  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich,While Virtual Reality continues to increase in fidelity  it remains an open question how to effectively reflect the user's movements and provide congruent feedback in virtual environments.We present VRsneaky  a system for producing auditory movement feedback  which helps participants orient themselves in a virtual environment by providing footstep sounds. The system reacts to the user's specific gait features and adjusts the audio accordingly. In a user study with 28 participants  we found that VRsneaky increases users' sense of presence as well as awareness of their own posture and gait. Additionally  we find that increasing auditory realism significantly influences certain characteristics of participants' gait.Our work shows that gait-aware audio feedback is a means to increase presence in virtual environments. We discuss opportunities and design requirements for future scenarios where users walk through immersive virtual worlds.
"When the Elephant Trumps": A Comparative Study on Spatial Audio for Orientation in 360º Videos,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Paulo Bala  Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute & Universidade Nova de Lisboa Raul Masu  Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute & Universidade Nova de Lisboa Valentina Nisi  Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute & Universidade da Madeira Nuno Nunes  Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute & IST  University of Lisbon,Orientation is an emerging issue in cinematic Virtual Reality (VR)  as viewers may fail in locating points of interest. Recent strategies to tackle this research problem have investigated the role of cues  specifically diegetic sound effects. In this paper  we examine the use of sound spatialization for orientation purposes  namely by studying different spatialization conditions ("none"  "partial"  and "full" spatial manipulation) of multitrack soundtracks. We performed a between-subject mixed-methods study with 36 participants  aided by Cue Control  a tool we developed for dynamic spatial sound editing and data collection/analysis. Based on existing literature on orientation cues in 360º and theories on human listening  we discuss situations in which the spatialization was more effective (namely  "full" spatial manipulation both when using only music and when combining music and diegetic effects)  and how this can be used by creators of 360º videos.
PaCaPa: A Handheld VR Device for Rendering Size  Shape  and Stiffness of Virtual Objects in Tool-based Interactions,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Yuqian Sun  The University of Tokyo Shigeo Yoshida  The University of Tokyo & JST PRESTO Takuji Narumi  The University of Tokyo & JST PRESTO Michitaka Hirose  The University of Tokyo,We present PaCaPa  a handheld device that renders haptics on a user's palm when the user interacts with virtual objects using virtual tools such as a stick. PaCaPa is a cuboid device with two wings that open and close. As the user's stick makes contact with a virtual object  the wings open by a specific degree to dynamically change the pressure on the palm and fingers. The open angle of the wings is calculated from the angle between the virtual stick and hand direction. As the stick bites into the target object  a large force is generated. Our device enables three kinds of renderings: size  shape  and stiffness. We conducted user studies to evaluate the performance of our device. We also evaluated our device in two application scenarios. User feedback and qualitative ratings indicated that our device can make indirect interaction with handheld tools more realistic.

The "TechShops" approach emerged because we found it difficult to engage YAID in traditional contextual interviews. Hence  we offered a series of "TechShops"  which we found useful in: enabling engagement with participants  their families and support staff; fostering relationships; and gaining research access. We explain the context of "TechShops"  and reflect upon the opportunities and challenges that the approach offers for both researchers and YAID in exploratory design research.
How to Carry Out Usability Studies with Visually Impaired Children,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Carlos A.

We present the development of a low-cost  do-it-yourself  wheelchair locomotion-device  which allows navigation in VR. More than 50 people  including 9 wheelchair users  participated in the evaluations of three prototypes and a number of games developed for them. Initially  cybersickness turned out to be a problem  but when we changed to an electric wheelchair instead of a manual and fine-tuned the controls this discomfort was remarkably reduced. We suggest using this device for gaming  training  interaction design  accessibility studies and the operation of robots.
Insights in Experimental Data through Intuitive and Interactive Statistics,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Jean-Bernard Martens  Eindhoven University of Technology,It is not unusual for empirical scientists  who are often not specialists in statistics  to have only limited trust in the statistical analyses that they apply to their data. The claim of this course is that an improved human-computer interaction with statistical methods can be accomplished by providing a simple mental model of what statistics does  and to support this model through well-chosen visualizations and interactive exploration. In order to support this proposed approach  an entirely new program for performing interactive statistics  called ILLMO  was developed. This course will use examples of frequent statistical tasks such as hypothesis testing  linear regression and clustering to introduce the key concepts underlying intuitive and interactive statistics.

The collection of multi-dimensional sets of data – a trademark of high-quality ethnographic work – enables inter-weaving threads of HCI perspectives in complex human factors and user research contexts. To achieve this  a comprehensive toolbox of ethnographic methods is introduced along with practical hands-on sessions to familiarize with these methodological instruments.
Card Mapper: Enabling Data-Driven Reflections on Ideation Cards,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Dimitrios Darzentas  University of Nottingham Raphael Velt  Unaffiliated Richard Wetzel  Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts Peter J. Craigon  University of Nottingham Hanne G. Wagner  University of Nottingham Lachlan D. Urquhart  University of Edinburgh Steve Benford  University of Nottingham,We explore how usage data captured from ideation cards can enable reflection on design. We deployed a deck of ideation cards on a Masters level module over two years  developing the means to capture the students' designs into a digital repository. We created two visualisations to reveal the relative co-occurrences of the cards as concept space and the relative proximity of designs (through cards used in common) as design space. We used these to elicit reflections from the perspectives of students  teachers and card designers. Our findings inspire ideas for extending the data-driven use of ideation cards throughout the design process; informing the redesign of cards  the rules for using them and their live connection to supporting materials and enabling stakeholders to reflect and recognise challenges and opportunities. We also identified the need  and potential ways  to capture a richer design rationale  including annotations  discarded cards and varying card interpretations.
Towards Understanding the Design of Positive Pre-sleep Through a Neurofeedback Artistic Experience,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Nathan Arthur Semertzidis  RMIT University Betty Sargeant  RMIT University Justin Dwyer  RMIT University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University Fabio Zambetta  RMIT University,Poor sleep has been acknowledged as an increasingly prevalent global health concern  however  how to design for promoting sleep is relatively underexplored. We propose neurofeedback technology may potentially facilitate restfulness and sleep onset  and we explore this through the creation and study of "Inter-Dream"  a novel multisensory interactive artistic experience driven by neurofeedback. Twelve participants individually rested  augmented by Inter-Dream. Results demonstrated: statistically significant decreases in pre-sleep cognitive arousal (p = .01)  negative emotion (p = .008)  and negative affect (p = .004). EEG readings were also indicative of restorative restfulness and cognitive stillness  while interview responses described experiences of mindfulness and playful self-exploration. Taken together  our work highlights neurofeedback as a potential pathway for future research in the promotion of sleep  while also suggesting strategies for designing towards this within the context of pre-sleep.
Investigating Slowness as a Frame to Design Longer-Term Experiences with Personal Data: A Field Study of Olly,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,William Odom  Simon Fraser University Ron Wakkary  Eindhoven University of Technology & Simon Fraser University Jeroen Hol  Eindhoven University of Technology Bram Naus  Eindhoven University of Technology Pepijn Verburg  Eindhoven University of Technology Tal Amram  Simon Fraser University Amy Chen  Simon Fraser University,We describe the design and deployment of Olly  a domestic music player that enables people to re-experience digital music they listened to in the past. Olly uses its owner's Last.FM listening history metadata archive to occasionally select a song from their past  but offers no user control over what is selected or when. We deployed Olly in 3 homes for 15 months to explore how its slow pace might support experiences of reflection and reminiscence. Findings revealed that Olly became highly integrated in participants lives with sustained engagement over time. They drew on Olly to reflect on past life experiences and reactions indicated an increase in perceived value of their Last.FM archive. Olly also provoked reflections on the temporalities of personal data and technology. Findings are interpreted to present opportunities for future HCI research and practice.
Follow the Money: Managing Personal Finance Digitally,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Makayla Lewis  Brunel University London Mark Perry  Brunel University London,The move towards digital payments and mobile money  and away from physical cash and banking services offers users opportunities to change the ways that they can spend  save and manage their money through a variety of personal financial management services. However  set against ordinary  everyday patterns of spending  saving and other forms of financial transaction  it is not clear how users might interact with  understand  or value financial management services that utilise rich data and connected digital content for their personal use. In order to explore how people might engage with such systems  we conducted a study of financial activity  following people's transactional activity over time  and interviewing them about their practices  understandings  needs  concerns and expectations of current and future financial technologies. Drawing from the everyday activities and practices observed  we identify implications for the design of digitally enabled  personal financial systems.
Recipes for Programmable Money,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Chris Elsden  Northumbria University Tom Feltwell  Northumbria University Shaun Lawson  Northumbria University John Vines  Northumbria University,This paper presents a qualitative study of the recent integration of a UK-based  digital-first mobile banking app – Monzo – with the web automation service IFTTT (If This Then That). Through analysis of 113 unique IFTTT 'recipes' shared by Monzo users on public community forums  we illustrate the potentially diverse functions of these recipes  and how they are achieved through different kinds of automation. Beyond achieving more convenient and efficient financial management  we note many playful and expressive applications of conditionality and automation that far extend traditional functions of banking applications and infrastructure. We use these findings to map opportunities  challenges and areas of future research in the development of 'programmable money' and related financial technologies. Specifically  we present design implications for the extension of native digital banking applications; novel uses of banking data; the applicability of blockchains and smart contracts; and future forms of financial autonomy.
ReCall: Crowdsourcing on Basic Phones to Financially Sustain Voice Forums,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Aditya Vashistha  University of Washington Abhinav Garg  University of Washington Richard Anderson  University of Washington,Although voice forums are widely used to enable marginalized communities to produce  consume  and share information  their financial sustainability is a key concern among HCI4D researchers and practitioners. We present ReCall  a crowdsourcing marketplace accessible via phone calls where low-income rural residents vocally transcribe audio files to gain free airtime to participate in voice forums as well as to earn money. We conducted a series of experimental and usability evaluations with 28 low-income people in rural India to examine the effect of phone types  channel types  and review modes on speech transcription performance. We then deployed ReCall for two weeks to 24 low-income rural residents who placed 5 879 phone calls  completed 29 000 micro tasks to yield transcriptions with 85% accuracy  and earned INR 20 500. Our mixed-methods analysis indicates that each minute of crowd work on ReCall gives users eight minutes of free airtime on another voice forum  and thus illustrates a way to address the financial sustainability of voice forums.
Digital Financial Needs of Micro-entrepreneur Women in Pakistan: Is Mobile Money The Answer?,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Maryam Mustafa  Information Technology University Noor Mazhar  Information Technology University Ayesha Asghar  Information Technology University Lahore Maryem Zafar Usmani  Information Technology University Lubna Razaq  Information Technology University Richard Anderson  University of Washington,This paper studies the use of Digital Financial Services (DFS) as a solution to women's financial inclusion in deeply patriarchal  resource constrained communities. Through a qualitative  empirical study we map the financial life cycles of 20 women micro-entrepreneurs in different cities in Pakistan and the challenges they face. We explore how technology is currently influencing these women's businesses and personal lives and reveal how mobile money is not tuned to the problems they face and their financial needs. We present alternate design directions for meeting the technological and financial needs of these women  circumnavigating the patriarchal structures that constrain them.
Evaluating Expert Curation in a Baby Milestone Tracking App,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Ayelet Ben-Sasson  University of Haifa Eli Ben-Sasson  Technion Kayla Jacobs  Technion Elisheva Rotman Argaman  Technion Eden Saig  Technion,Early childhood developmental screening is critical for timely detection and intervention. babyTRACKS (Formerly Baby CROINC  CROwd INtelligence Curation.) is a free  live  interactive developmental tracking mobile app with over 3 000 children's diaries. Parents write or select short milestone texts  like "began taking first steps " to record their babies' developmental achievements  and receive crowd-based percentiles to evaluate development and catch potential delays. Currently  an expert-based Curated Crowd Intelligence (CCI) process manually groups incoming novel parent-authored milestone texts according to their similarity to existing milestones in the database (for example  starting to walk)  or determining that the milestone represents a new developmental concept not seen before in another child's diary. CCI cannot scale well  however  and babyTRACKS is mature enough  with a rich enough database of existing milestone texts  to now consider machine learning tools to replace or assist the human curators. Three new studies explore (1) the usefulness of automation  by analyzing the human cost of CCI and how the work is currently broken down; (2) the validity of automation  by testing the inter-rater reliability of curators; and (3) the value of automation  by appraising the "real world" clinical value of milestones when assessing child development. We conclude that automation can indeed be appropriate and helpful for a large percentage  though not all  of CCI work. We further establish realistic upper bounds for algorithm performance; confirm that the babyTRACKS milestones dataset is valid for training and testing purposes; and verify that it represents clinically meaningful developmental information.
Breakdowns in Home-School Collaboration for Behavioral Intervention,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Gabriela Marcu  University of Michigan Allison Spiller  University of Michigan Jonathan Arevalo Garay  Drexel University James E. Connell  Drexel University Laura R. Pina  University of Washington,For some children  behavioral health services are critical in supporting their development and preventing adverse outcomes such as school dropout  substance use  or encounters with juvenile justice. Schools play an important role in identifying problem behavior and providing appropriate intervention  and these efforts are most effective when executed in collaboration with parents at home. However  home-school collaboration is difficult to achieve. In this work  we investigated lack of information sharing as a barrier to collaboration  through a qualitative study including observation  contextual inquiry  and interviews. We found that policies  processes  and tools for documenting behaviors in schools are implemented without significant consideration toward exchanging information with parents. Consequently  a lack of effective two-way information sharing tended to hinder collaboration and erode trust. Combining our empirical findings with evidence-based strategies for parent involvement  we discuss design opportunities for promoting collaboration toward positive behavioral outcomes for children.
Making Diabetes Education Interactive: Tangible Educational Toys for Children with Type-1 Diabetes,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Charalampos Kyfonidis  University of Strathclyde Marilyn Lennon  University of Strathclyde,Younger children (under 9 years) with type-1 diabetes are often very passive in the management of their condition and can face difficulties in accessing and understanding basic diabetes related information. This can make transitioning to self-management in later years very challenging. Previous research has mostly focused on educational interventions for older children. To create an educational tool which can support the diabetes educational process of younger children  we conducted a multiphase and multi-stakeholder user-centred design process. The result is an interactive tool that illustrates diabetes concepts in an age-appropriate way with the use of tangible toys. The tool was evaluated inside a paediatric diabetes clinic with clinicians  children and parents and was found to be engaging  acceptable and effective. In addition to providing implications for the design and adoption of educational tools for children in a clinical setting  we discuss the challenges for conducting user-centred design in such a setting.
Evaluating the Impact of a Mobile Neurofeedback App for Young Children at School and Home,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Alissa N. Antle  SminonSimon Fraser University Elgin-Skye McLaren  Simon Fraser University Holly Fiedler  Langara College Naomi Johnson  Social Work Independent Consultant,About 18% of children in industrialized countries suffer from anxiety. We designed a mobile neurofeedback app  called Mind-Full  based on existing design guidelines. Our goal was for young children in lower socio-economic status schools to improve their ability to self-regulate anxiety by using Mind-Full. In this paper we report on quantitative outcomes from a sixteen-week field evaluation with 20 young children (aged 5 to 8). Our methodological contribution includes using a control group  validated measures of anxiety and stress  and assessing transfer and maintenance. Results from teacher and parent behavioral surveys indicated gains in children's ability to self-regulate anxiety at school and home; a decrease in anxious behaviors at home; and cortisol tests showed variable improvement in physiological stress levels. We contribute to HCI for mental health with evidence that it is viable to use a mobile app in lower socio-economic status schools to improve children's mental health.
Airport Accessibility and Navigation Assistance for People with Visual Impairments,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Carron 2,João Guerreiro  Carnegie Mellon University Dragan Ahmetovic  University of Turin\t & Carnegie Mellon University Daisuke Sato  IBM Research - Tokyo & Carnegie Mellon University Kris Kitani  Robotics Institute Chieko Asakawa  Carnegie Mellon University,People with visual impairments often have to rely on the assistance of sighted guides in airports  which prevents them from having an independent travel experience. In order to learn about their perspectives on current airport accessibility  we conducted two focus groups that discussed their needs and experiences in-depth  as well as the potential role of assistive technologies. We found that independent navigation is a main challenge and severely impacts their overall experience. As a result  we equipped an airport with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon-based navigation system and performed a real-world study where users navigated routes relevant for their travel experience. We found that despite the challenging environment participants were able to complete their itinerary independently  presenting none to few navigation errors and reasonable timings. This study presents the first systematic evaluation posing BLE technology as a strong approach to increase the independence of visually impaired people in airports.
Project Sidewalk: A Web-based Crowdsourcing Tool for Collecting Sidewalk Accessibility Data At Scale,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Manaswi Saha  University of Washington Michael Saugstad  University of Washington Hanuma Teja Maddali  University of Maryland Aileen Zeng  University of Washington Ryan Holland  Montgomery Blair High School Steven Bower  University of Maryland Aditya Dash  University of Maryland Sage Chen  University of Michigan Anthony Li  University of Maryland Kotaro Hara  Singapore Management University Jon E. Froehlich  University of Washington,We introduce Project Sidewalk  a new web-based tool that enables online crowdworkers to remotely label pedestrian-related accessibility problems by virtually walking through city streets in Google Street View. To train  engage  and sustain users  we apply basic game design principles such as interactive onboarding  mission-based tasks  and progress dashboards. In an 18-month deployment study  797 online users contributed 205 385 labels and audited 2 941 miles of Washington DC streets. We compare behavioral and labeling quality differences between paid crowdworkers and volunteers  investigate the effects of label type  label severity  and majority vote on accuracy  and analyze common labeling errors. To complement these findings  we report on an interview study with three key stakeholder groups (N=14) soliciting reactions to our tool and methods. Our findings demonstrate the potential of virtually auditing urban accessibility and highlight tradeoffs between scalability and quality compared to traditional approaches.
Understanding and Designing for Deaf or Hard of Hearing Drivers on Uber,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Sooyeon Lee  Pennsylvania State University Bjorn Hubert-Wallander  Uber Technologies  Inc. Molly Stevens  Uber Technologies  Inc. John M. Carroll  Pennsylvania State University,We used content analysis of in-app driver survey responses  customer support tickets  and tweets  and face-to-face interviews of DHH Uber drivers to better understand the DHH driver experience. Here we describe challenges DHH drivers experience and how they address those difficulties via Uber's accessibility features and their own workarounds. We also identify and discuss design and product opportunities to improve the DHH driver experience on Uber.
Understanding Trust  Transportation  and Accessibility through Ridesharing,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Robin N. Brewer  University of Michigan Vaishnav Kameswaran  University of Michigan,Relatively few studies of accessibility and transportation for people with vision impairments have investigated forms of transportation besides public transportation and walking. To develop a more nuanced understanding of this context  we turn to ridesharing  an increasingly used mode of transportation. We interviewed 16 visually-impaired individuals about their active use of ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft. Our findings show that  while people with vision impairments value independence  ridesharing involves building trust across a complex network of stakeholders and technologies. This data is used to start a discussion on how other systems can facilitate trust for people with vision impairments by considering the role of conversation  affordances of system incentives  and increased agency.
Make This! Introduction to Electronics Prototyping Using Arduino,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,David Sirkin  Stanford University Nikolas Martelaro  Accenture Technology Labs Wendy Ju  Cornell Tech,This course is a hands-on introduction to interactive electronics prototyping for people with a variety of backgrounds  including those with no prior experience in electronics. Familiarity with programming is helpful  but not required. Participants learn basic electronics  microcontroller programming and physical prototyping using the Arduino platform  then use digital and analog sensors  LED lights and motors to build  program and customize a small paper robot.
Rapid Prototyping of Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality Interfaces,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Michael Nebeling  University of Michigan,This course introduces participants to rapid prototyping techniques for augmented reality and virtual reality interfaces. Participants will learn about both physical prototyping with paper and Play-Doh as well as digital prototyping via new visual authoring tools for AR/VR. The course is structured into four sessions. After an introduction to AR/VR prototyping principles and materials  the next two sessions are hands-on  allowing participants to practice new physical and digital prototyping techniques. These techniques use a combination of new paper-based AR/VR design templates and smartphone-based capture and replay tools  adapting Wizard of Oz for AR/VR design. The fourth and final session will allow participants to test and critique each other's prototypes while checking against emerging design principles and guidelines. The instructor has previously taught the techniques to broad student audiences with a wide variety of non-technical backgrounds  including design  architecture  business  medicine  education  and psychology  who shared a common interest in user experience and interaction design. The course is targeted at non-technical audiences including HCI practitioners  user experience researchers  and interaction design professionals and students. A useful byproduct of the course will be a small portfolio piece of a first AR/VR interface designed iteratively and collaboratively in teams.
Balancing Interaction Design,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Gilbert Cockton  Northumbria University,Over the last two decades  creative  lean and strategic design approaches have become increasingly prevalent in the development of interactive technologies  but tensions exist with longer established approaches such as human factors engineering and user-centered design. These tensions can be harnessed productively by first giving equal status in principle to creative  business and agile engineering practices  and then supporting this with flexible critical approaches and resources that can balance and integrate across a range of multidisciplinary design practices.
Self-Control in Cyberspace: Applying Dual Systems Theory to a Review of Digital Self-Control Tools,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Ulrik Lyngs  University of Oxford Kai Lukoff  University of Washington Petr Slovak  King's College London Reuben Binns  University of Oxford Adam Slack  University of Oxford Michael Inzlicht  University of Toronto Max Van Kleek  University of Oxford Nigel Shadbolt  University of Oxford,Many people struggle to control their use of digital devices. However  our understanding of the design mechanisms that support user self-control remains limited. In this paper  we make two contributions to HCI research in this space: first  we analyse 367 apps and browser extensions from the Google Play  Chrome Web  and Apple App stores to identify common core design features and intervention strategies afforded by current tools for digital self-control. Second  we adapt and apply an integrative dual systems model of self-regulation as a framework for organising and evaluating the design features found. Our analysis aims to help the design of better tools in two ways: (i) by identifying how  through a well-established model of self-regulation  current tools overlap and differ in how they support self-control; and (ii) by using the model to reveal underexplored cognitive mechanisms that could aid the design of new tools.
Understanding the Social Acceptability of Mobile Devices using the Stereotype Content Model,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Valentin Schwind  University of Stuttgart Niklas Deierlein  University of Hagen Romina Poguntke  VIS  University of Stuttgart Niels Henze  University of Regensburg,Understanding social perception is important for designing mobile devices that are socially acceptable. Previous work not only investigated the social acceptability of mobile devices and interaction techniques but also provided tools to measure social acceptance. However  we lack a robust model that explains the underlying factors that make devices socially acceptable. In this paper  we consider mobile devices as social objects and investigate if the stereotype content model (SCM) can be applied to those devices. Through a study that assesses combinations of mobile devices and group stereotypes  we show that mobile devices have a systematic effect on the stereotypes' warmth and competence. Supported by a second study  which combined mobile devices without a specific stereotypical user  our result suggests that mobile devices are perceived stereotypically by themselves. Our combined results highlight mobile devices as social objects and the importance of considering stereotypes when assessing social acceptance of mobile devices.
23 Ways to Nudge: A Review of Technology-Mediated Nudging in Human-Computer Interaction,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Ana Caraban  Instituto Superior Técnico  Persuasive Tech Lab  Madeira-ITI Evangelos Karapanos  Persuasive Tech Lab  Cyprus University of Technology Daniel Gonçalves  Instituto Superior Técnico  University of Lisbon Pedro Campos  Madeira-ITI  University of Madeira,Ten years ago  Thaler and Sunstein introduced the notion of nudging to talk about how subtle changes in the 'choice architecture' can alter people's behaviors in predictable ways. This idea was eagerly adopted in HCI and applied in multiple contexts  including health  sustainability and privacy. Despite this  we still lack an understanding of how to design effective technology-mediated nudges. In this paper we present a systematic review of the use of nudging in HCI research with the goal of laying out the design space of technology-mediated nudging – the why (i.e.  which cognitive biases do nudges combat) and the how (i.e.  what exact mechanisms do nudges employ to incur behavior change). All in all  we found 23 distinct mechanisms of nudging  grouped in 6 categories  and leveraging 15 different cognitive biases. We present these as a framework for technology-mediated nudging  and discuss the factors shaping nudges' effectiveness and their ethical implications.
A Review & Analysis of Mindfulness Research in HCI: Framing Current Lines of Research and Future Opportunities,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Nađa Terzimehić  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Renate Häuslschmid  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Heinrich Hussmann  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich m.c. schraefel  University of Southampton,Mindfulness is a term seen with increasing frequency in HCI literature  and yet the term itself is used almost as variously as the number of papers in which it appears. This diversity makes comparing or evaluating HCI approaches around mindfulness or understanding the design space itself a challenging task. We conducted a structured ACM literature search based on the term mindfulness. Our selection process yielded 38 relevant papers  which we analyzed for their definition  motivation  practice  evaluation and technology use around mindfulness. We identify similarities  divergences and areas of interest for each aspect  resulting in a framework composed of four perspectives and seven lines of research. We highlight challenges and opportunities for future HCI research and design.
REsCUE: A framework for REal-time feedback on behavioral CUEs using multimodal anomaly detection,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Riku Arakawa  Tokyo University Hiromu Yakura  Teambox Inc. & University of Tsukuba,Executive coaching has been drawing more and more attention for developing corporate managers. While conversing with managers  coach practitioners are also required to understand internal states of coachees through objective observations. In this paper  we present REsCUE  an automated system to aid coach practitioners in detecting unconscious behaviors of their clients. Using an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm applied to multimodal behavior data such as the subject's posture and gaze  REsCUE notifies behavioral cues for coaches via intuitive and interpretive feedback in real-time. Our evaluation with actual coaching scenes confirms that REsCUE provides the informative cues to understand internal states of coachees. Since REsCUE is based on the unsupervised method and does not assume any prior knowledge  further applications beside executive coaching are conceivable using our framework.
ORC Layout: Adaptive GUI Layout with OR-Constraints,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Yue Jiang  University of Maryland  College Park Ruofei Du  University of Maryland  College Park & Google  LLC Christof Lutteroth  University of Bath Wolfgang Stuerzlinger  Simon Fraser University,We propose a novel approach for constraint-based graphical user interface (GUI) layout based on OR-constraints (ORC) in standard soft/hard linear constraint systems. ORC layout unifies grid layout and flow layout  supporting both their features as well as cases where grid and flow layouts individually fail. We describe ORC design patterns that enable designers to safely create flexible layouts that work across different screen sizes and orientations. We also present the ORC Editor  a GUI editor that enables designers to apply ORC in a safe and effective manner  mixing grid  flow and new ORC layout features as appropriate. We demonstrate that our prototype can adapt layouts to screens with different aspect ratios with only a single layout specification  easing the burden of GUI maintenance. Finally  we show that ORC specifications can be modified interactively and solved efficiently at runtime.
MessageOnTap: A Suggestive Interface to Facilitate Messaging-related Tasks,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Fanglin Chen  Human-Computer Interaction Institute Kewei Xia  Wuhan University Karan Dhabalia  Carnegie Mellon University Jason I. Hong  Carnegie Mellon University,Text messages are sometimes prompts that lead to information related tasks  e.g. checking one's schedule  creating reminders  or sharing content. We introduce MessageOnTap  a suggestive inter-face for smartphones that uses the text in a conversation to suggest task shortcuts that can streamline likely next actions. When activated  MessageOnTap uses word embeddings to rank relevant external apps  and parameterizes associated task shortcuts using key phrases mentioned in the conversation  such as times  persons  or events. MessageOnTap also tailors the auto-complete dictionary based on text in the conversation  to streamline any text input.We first conducted a month-long study of messaging behaviors(N=22) that informed our design. We then conducted a lab study to evaluate the effectiveness of MessageOnTap's suggestive interface  and found that participants can complete tasks 3.1x faster withMessageOnTap than their typical task flow.
Critter: Augmenting Creative Work with Dynamic Checklists  Automated Quality Assurance  and Contextual Reviewer Feedback,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Aditya Bharadwaj  Virginia Tech Pao Siangliulue  B12 Adam Marcus  B12 Kurt Luther  Virginia Tech,Checklists and guidelines have played an increasingly important role in complex tasks ranging from the cockpit to the operating theater. Their role in creative tasks like design is less explored. In a needfinding study with expert web designers  we identified designers' challenges in adhering to a checklist of design guidelines. We built Critter  which addressed these challenges with three components: Dynamic Checklists that progressively disclose guideline complexity with a self-pruning hierarchical view  AutoQA to automate common quality assurance checks  and guideline-specific feedback provided by a reviewer to highlight mistakes as they appear. In an observational study  we found that the more engaged a designer was with Critter  the fewer mistakes they made in following design guidelines. Designers rated the AutoQA and contextual feedback experience highly  and provided feedback on the tradeoffs of the hierarchical Dynamic Checklists. We additionally found that a majority of designers rated the AutoQA experience as excellent and felt that it increased the quality of their work. Finally  we discuss broader implications for supporting complex creative tasks.
PickCells: A Physically Reconfigurable Cell-composed Touchscreen,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Alix Goguey  Swansea University Cameron Steer  Swansea University Andrés Lucero  Aalto University Laurence Nigay  Université Grenoble Alpes Deepak Ranjan Sahoo  Swansea University Céline Coutrix  CNRS Anne Roudaut  University of Bristol Sriram Subramanian  University of Sussex Yutaka Tokuda  University of Sussex Timothy Neate  City University of London Jennifer Pearson  Swansea University Simon Robinson  Swansea University Matt Jones  Swansea University,Touchscreens are the predominant medium for interactions with digital services; however  their current fixed form factor narrows the scope for rich physical interactions by limiting interaction possibilities to a single  planar surface. In this paper we introduce the concept of PickCells  a fully re-configurable device concept composed of cells  that breaks the mould of rigid screens and explores a modular system that affords rich sets of tangible interactions and novel across-device relationships. Through a series of co-design activities -- involving HCI experts and potential end-users of such systems -- we synthesised a design space aimed at inspiring future research  giving researchers and designers a framework in which to explore modular screen interactions. The design space we propose unifies existing works on modular touch surfaces under a general framework and broadens horizons by opening up unexplored spaces providing new interaction possibilities. In this paper  we present the PickCells concept  a design space of modular touch surfaces  and propose a toolkit for quick scenario prototyping.
Sustainabot – Exploring the Use of Everyday Foodstuffs as Output and Input for and with Emergent Users,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Simon Robinson  Swansea University Jennifer Pearson  Swansea University Mark D. Holton  Swansea University Shashank Ahire  Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Matt Jones  Swansea University,Mainstream digital interactions are spread over a plethora of devices and form-factors  from mobiles to laptops; printouts to large screens. For emergent users  however  such abundance of choice is rarely accessible or affordable. In particular  viewing mobile content on a larger screen  or printing out copies  is often not available. In this paper we present Sustainabot – a small robot printer that uses everyday materials to print shapes and patterns from mobile phones. Sustainabot was proposed and developed by and with emergent users through a series of co-creation workshops. We begin by discussing this process  then detail the open-source mobile printer prototype. We carried out two evaluations of Sustainabot  the first focused on printing with materials in situ  and the second on understandability of its output. We present these results  and discuss opportunities and challenges for similar developments. We conclude by highlighting where and how similar devices could be used in future.

In this paper  we investigate how  when  and why people used one such product: Spectacles. We conducted 39 semi-structured interviews and surveys with 191 owners of Spectacles. We found that the form factor elicits sustained usage behaviors  and opens opportunities for new use-cases and types of content captured. We provide a usage typology  and highlight societal and individual factors that influence the classification of behaviors.
Underneath the Skin: An Analysis of YouTube Videos to Understand Insertable Device Interaction,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Aida Komkaite  Aalborg University Liga Lavrinovica  Aalborg University Maria Vraka  Aalborg University Mikael B. Skov  Aalborg University,During the last decade  people have started to experiment with insertable technology like RFID or NFC chips and use them for e.g. identification. However  little is known about how people in fact interact with and adapt insertables. We conducted a video analysis of 122 YouTube videos to gain insight into the interaction with the insertables. Second  we implemented an online survey to complement our data from the video analysis. Our findings show that there are many opportunities for interaction with insertables both for task-oriented and creative purposes. However  there are also multiple challenges and obstacles as well as side effects and health concerns. Our findings conclude that the current infrastructure is not ready to support the use of insertables yet  and we discuss implications of this.

The Role of Physical Props in VR Climbing Environments,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Forth,Peter Schulz  University of Bremen Dmitry Alexandrovsky  University of Bremen Felix Putze  University of Bremen Rainer Malaka  University of Bremen Johannes Schöning  University of Bremen,Dealing with fear of falling is a challenge in sport climbing. Virtual reality (VR) research suggests that using physical and reality-based interaction increases the presence in VR. In this paper  we present a study that investigates the influence of physical props on presence  stress and anxiety in a VR climbing environment involving whole body movement. To help climbers overcoming fear of falling  we compared three different conditions: Climbing in reality at 10 m height  physical climbing in VR (with props attached to the climbing wall) and virtual climbing in VR using game controllers. From subjective reports and biosignals  our results show that climbing with props in VR increases the anxiety and sense of realism in VR for sport climbing. This suggests that VR in combination with physical props are an effective simulation setup to induce the sense of height.
FTVR in VR: Evaluation of 3D Perception With a Simulated Volumetric Fish-Tank Virtual Reality Display,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Forth,Dylan Fafard  University of Saskatchewan Ian Stavness  University of Saskatchewan Martin Dechant  University of Saskatchewan Regan Mandryk  University of Saskatchewan Qian Zhou  University of British Columbia Sidney S. Fels  University of British Columbia,Spherical fish tank virtual reality (FTVR) displays attempt to create a virtual "crystal ball" experience using head-tracked rendering. Almost all of these systems have omitted stereo cues  making them easy to build  but it is not clear how much this omission degrades the 3D experience. In this study  we evaluate performance and subjective effects of stereo on 3D perception and interaction tasks with a spherical FTVR display. To control for calibration error and tracking latency  we perform the evaluation on a simulated spherical display in VR. The results of our study provide a clear recommendation for the design and use of spherical FTVR displays: while omitting stereo may not be readily apparent for users  their performance will be significantly degraded (20% - 91% increase in median task time). Therefore  including stereo viewing in spherical displays is critical for use in FTVR.
Around the (Virtual) World: Infinite Walking in Virtual Reality Using Electrical Muscle Stimulation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Forth,Jonas Auda  University of Duisburg-Essen Max Pascher  University of Duisburg-Essen Stefan Schneegass  Universität Duisburg-Essen,Virtual worlds are infinite environments in which the user can move around freely. When shifting from controller-based movement to regular walking as an input  the limitation of the real world also limits the virtual world. Tackling this challenge  we propose the use of electrical muscle stimulation to limit the necessary real-world space to create an unlimited walking experience. We thereby actuate the users' legs in a way that they deviate from their straight route and thus  walk in circles in the real world while still walking straight in the virtual world. We report on a study comparing this approach to vision shift - the state of the art approach - as well as combining both approaches. The results show that particularly combining both approaches yield high potential to create an infinite walking experience.
VirtualBricks: Exploring a Scalable  Modular Toolkit for Enabling Physical Manipulation in VR,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Forth,Jatin Arora  Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Aryan Saini  Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Nirmita Mehra  Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Varnit Jain  Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Shwetank Shrey  Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Aman Parnami  Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology,Often Virtual Reality (VR) experiences are limited by the design of standard controllers. This work aims to liberate a VR developer from these limitations in the physical realm to provide an expressive match to the limitless possibilities in the virtual realm. VirtualBricks is a LEGO based toolkit that enables construction of a variety of physical-manipulation enabled controllers for VR  by offering a set of feature bricks that emulate as well as extend the capabilities of default controllers. Based on the LEGO platform  the toolkit provides a modular  scalable solution for enabling passive haptics in VR. We demonstrate the versatility of our designs through a rich set of applications including re-implementations of artifacts from recent research. We share a VR Integration package for integration with Unity VR IDE  the CAD models for the feature bricks  for easy deployment of VirtualBricks within the community.
Coding for Outdoor Play: a Coding Platform for Children to Invent and Enhance Outdoor Play Experiences,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Gala,Netta Ofer  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Idan David  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Hadas Erel  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Oren Zuckerman  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya,Outdoor play is in decline  including its benefits to children's development. Coding  a typically indoor  screen-based activity  can potentially enrich outdoor play  serving as a rule-making medium. We present a coding platform that controls a programmable hardware device  enabling children to technologically-enhance their outdoor play experiences by inventing game ideas  coding them  and playing their games together with their friends. In the evaluation study  24 children used the system to invent and play outdoor games. Results show children are able to bridge between the different domains of coding and outdoor play. They used the system to modify traditional games and invent new ones  enriching their outdoor experience. Children merged computational concepts with physical game elements  integrated physical outdoor properties as variables in their code  and were excited to see their code come to life. We conclude children can use coding to express their ideas by creating technologically-enhanced outdoor play experiences.
Group Interactions in Location-Based Gaming: A Case Study of Raiding in Pokémon GO,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Gala,Arpita Bhattacharya  University of Washington Travis W. Windleharth  University of Washington Rio Anthony Ishii  University of Washington Ivy M. Acevedo  University of Washington Cecilia Aragon  University of Washington Julie A. Kientz  University of Washington Jason C. Yip  University of Washinton Jin Ha Lee  University of Washington,Raiding is a format in digital gaming that requires groups of people to collaborate and/or compete for a common goal. In 2017  the raiding format was introduced in the location-based mobile game Pokémon GO  which offers a mixed reality experience to friends and strangers coordinating for in-person raids. To understand this technology-mediated social phenomenon  we conducted over a year of participant observations  surveys with 510 players  and interviews with 25 players who raid in Pokémon GO. Using the analytical lens of Arrow  McGrath  and Berdahl's theory of small groups as complex systems  we identify global  local  and contextual dynamics in location-based raiding that support and challenge ad-hoc group formation in real life. Based on this empirical and theoretical understanding  we discuss implications to design for transparency  social affordances  and bridging gaps between global and contextual dynamics for increased positive and inclusive community interactions.
ExerCube vs. Personal Trainer: Evaluating a Holistic  Immersive  and Adaptive Fitness Game Setup,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Gala,Anna Lisa Martin-Niedecken  Zurich University of the Arts Katja Rogers  Ulm University Laia Turmo Vidal  Uppsala University Elisa D. Mekler  University of Basel Elena Márquez Segura  Uppsala University,Today's spectrum of playful fitness solutions features systems that are clearly game-first or fitness-first in design; hardly any sufficiently incorporate both areas. Consequently  existing applications and evaluations often lack in focus on attractiveness and effectiveness  which should be addressed on the levels of body  controller  and game scenario following a holistic design approach. To contribute to this topic and as a proof-of-concept  we designed the ExerCube  an adaptive fitness game setup. We evaluated participants' multi-sensory and bodily experiences with a non-adaptive and an adaptive ExerCube version and compared them with personal training to reveal insights to inform the next iteration of the ExerCube. Regarding flow  enjoyment and motivation  the ExerCube is on par with personal training. Results further reveal differences in perception of exertion  types and quality of movement  social factors  feedback  and audio experiences. Finally  we derive considerations for future research and development directions in holistic fitness game setups.
Social Play in an Exergame: How the Need to Belong Predicts Adherence,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Gala,Maximus D. Kaos  Queen's University & Aalto University Ryan E. Rhodes  University of Victoria Perttu Hämäläinen  Aalto University T.C. Nicholas Graham  Queen's University,The general trend in exercise interventions  including those based on exergames  is to see high initial enthusiasm but significantly declining adherence. Social play is considered a core tenet of the design of exercise interventions help foster motivation to play. To determine whether social play aids in adherence to exergames  we analyzed data from a study involving five waves of six-week exergame trials between a single-player and multiplayer group. In this paper  we examine the multiplayer group to determine who might benefit from social play and why. We found that people who primarily engage in group play have superior adherence to people who primarily play alone. People who play alone in a multiplayer exergame have worse adherence than playing a single-player version  which can undo any potential benefit of social play. The primary construct distinguishing group versus alone players is their sense of program belonging. Program belonging is  thus  crucial to multiplayer exergame design.
3D Pen + 3D Printer: Exploring the Role of Humans and Fabrication Machines in Creative Making,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Haruki Takahashi  Meiji University Jeeeun Kim  University of Colorado Boulder,The emergence of a 3D pen brings 3D modeling from a screen-based computer-aided design (CAD) system and 3D printing to direct and rapid crafting by 3D doodling. However  3D doodling remains challenging  requiring craft skills to rapidly express an idea  which is critical in creative making. We explore a new process of 3D modeling using 3D pen + 3D printer. Our pilot study shows that users need support to reduce the number of non-creative tasks to explore a wide design strategy. With the opportunity to invent a new 3D modeling process that needs to incorporate both a pen and printer  we propose techniques and a system that empower users to print while doodling to focus on creative exploration. Our user study shows that users can create diverse 3D models using a pen and printer. We discuss the roles of the human and fabrication machine for the future of fabrication.
Desktop Electrospinning: A Single Extruder 3D Printer for Producing Rigid Plastic and Electrospun Textiles,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Michael L. Rivera  Carnegie Mellon University Scott Hudson  Carnegie Mellon University,We present a new type of 3D printer that combines rigid plastic printing with melt electrospinning– a technique that uses electrostatic forces to create thin fibers from a molten polymer. Our printer enables custom-shaped textile sheets (similar in feel to wool felt) to be produced alongside rigid plastic using a single material (i.e.  PLA) in a single process. We contribute open-source firmware  hardware specifications  and printing parameters to achieve melt electrospinning. Our approach offers new opportunities for fabricating interactive objects and sensors that blend the flexibility  absorbency and softness of produced electrospun textiles with the structure and rigidity of hard plastic for actuation  sensing  and tactile experiences.
Kyub: A 3D Editor for Modeling Sturdy Laser-Cut Objects,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Patrick Baudisch  Hasso Plattner Institute Arthur Silber  Hasso Plattner Institute Yannis Kommana  Hasso Plattner Institute Milan Gruner  Hasso Plattner Institute Ludwig Wall  Hasso Plattner Institute Kevin Reuss  Hasso Plattner Institute Lukas Heilmann  Hasso Plattner Institute Robert Kovacs  Hasso Plattner Institute Daniel Rechlitz  Hasso Plattner Institute Thijs Roumen  Hasso Plattner Institute,We present an interactive editing system for laser cutting called kyub. Kyub allows users to create models efficiently in 3D  which it then unfolds into the 2D plates laser cutters expect. Unlike earlier systems  such as FlatFitFab  kyub affords construction based on closed box structures  which allows users to turn very thin material  such as 4mm plywood  into objects capable of withstanding large forces  such as chairs users can actually sit on. To afford such sturdy construction  every kyub project begins with a simple finger-joint "boxel"—a structure we found to be capable of withstanding over 500kg of load. Users then extend their model by attaching additional boxels. Boxels merge automatically  resulting in larger  yet equally strong structures. While the concept of stacking boxels allows kyub to offer the strong affordance and ease of use of a voxel-based editor  boxels are not confined to a grid and readily combine with kuyb's various geometry deformation tools. In our technical evaluation  objects built with kyub withstood hundreds of kilograms of loads. In our user study  non-engineers rated the learnability of kyub 6.1/7.
./trilaterate: A Fabrication Pipeline to Design and 3D Print Hover-  Touch-  and Force-Sensitive Objects,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Martin Schmitz  Technische Universität Darmstadt Martin Stitz  Technische Universität Darmstadt Florian Müller  Technische Universität Darmstadt Markus Funk  Technische Universität Darmstadt Max Mühlhäuser  Technische Universität Darmstadt,Hover  touch  and force are promising input modalities that get increasingly integrated into screens and everyday objects. However  these interactions are often limited to flat surfaces and the integration of suitable sensors is time-consuming and costly. To alleviate these limitations  we contribute Trilaterate: A fabrication pipeline to 3D print custom objects that detect the 3D position of a finger hovering  touching  or forcing them by combining multiple capacitance measurements via capacitive trilateration. Trilaterate places and routes actively-shielded sensors inside the object and operates on consumer-level 3D printers. We present technical evaluations and example applications that validate and demonstrate the wide applicability of Trilaterate.
Gamut: A Design Probe to Understand How Data Scientists Understand Machine Learning Models,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Fred Hohman  Georgia Institute of Technology Andrew Head  University of California  Berkeley Rich Caruana  Microsoft Research Robert DeLine  Microsoft Research Steven M. Drucker  Microsoft Research,Without good models and the right tools to interpret them  data scientists risk making decisions based on hidden biases  spurious correlations  and false generalizations. This has led to a rallying cry for model interpretability. Yet the concept of interpretability remains nebulous  such that researchers and tool designers lack actionable guidelines for how to incorporate interpretability into models and accompanying tools. Through an iterative design process with expert machine learning researchers and practitioners  we designed a visual analytics system  Gamut  to explore how interactive interfaces could better support model interpretation. Using Gamut as a probe  we investigated why and how professional data scientists interpret models  and how interface affordances can support data scientists in answering questions about model interpretability. Our investigation showed that interpretability is not a monolithic concept: data scientists have different reasons to interpret models and tailor explanations for specific audiences  often balancing competing concerns of simplicity and completeness. Participants also asked to use Gamut in their work  highlighting its potential to help data scientists understand their own data.
VizML: A Machine Learning Approach to Visualization Recommendation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Kevin Hu  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Michiel A. Bakker  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Stephen Li  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Tim Kraska  Massachusetts Institute of Technology César Hidalgo  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Visualization recommender systems aim to lower the barrier to exploring basic visualizations by automatically generating results for analysts to search and select  rather than manually specify. Here  we demonstrate a novel machine learning-based approach to visualization recommendation that learns visualization design choices from a large corpus of datasets and associated visualizations. First  we identify five key design choices made by analysts while creating visualizations  such as selecting a visualization type and choosing to encode a column along the X- or Y-axis. We train models to predict these design choices using one million dataset-visualization pairs collected from a popular online visualization platform. Neural networks predict these design choices with high accuracy compared to baseline models. We report and interpret feature importances from one of these baseline models. To evaluate the generalizability and uncertainty of our approach  we benchmark with a crowdsourced test set  and show that the performance of our model is comparable to human performance when predicting consensus visualization type  and exceeds that of other visualization recommender systems.
ATMSeer: Increasing Transparency and Controllability in Automated Machine Learning,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Qianwen Wang  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Yao Ming  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Zhihua Jin  Zhejiang University Qiaomu Shen  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Dongyu Liu  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Micah J. Smith  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Kalyan Veeramachaneni  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Huamin Qu  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,To relieve the pain of manually selecting machine learning algorithms and tuning hyperparameters  automated machine learning (AutoML) methods have been developed to automatically search for good models. Due to the huge model search space  it is impossible to try all models. Users tend to distrust automatic results and increase the search budget as much as they can  thereby undermining the efficiency of AutoML. To address these issues  we design and implement ATMSeer  an interactive visualization tool that supports users in refining the search space of AutoML and in analyzing the results. To guide the design of ATMSeer  we derive a workflow of using AutoML based on interviews with machine learning experts. A multi-granularity visualization is proposed to enable users to monitor the AutoML process  analyze the searched models  and refine the search space in real time. We demonstrate the utility and usability of ATMSeer through two case studies  expert interviews  and a user study with 13 end users.
AILA: Attentive Interactive Labeling Assistant for Document Classification through Attention-Based Deep Neural Networks,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Minsuk Choi  Korea University Cheonbok Park  Korea University Soyoung Yang  Korea University Yonggyu Kim  Ajou University Jaegul Choo  Korea University Sungsoo Ray Hong  University of Washington,Document labeling is a critical step in building various machine learning applications. However  the step can be time-consuming and arduous  requiring a significant amount of human efforts. To support an efficient document labeling environment  we present a system called Attentive Interactive Labeling Assistant (AILA). In its core  AILA uses Interactive Attention Module (IAM)  a novel module that visually highlights words in a document that labelers may pay attention to when labeling a document. IAM utilizes attention-based Deep Neural Networks which not only support a prediction of which words to highlight but also enable labelers to indicate words that should be assigned a high attention weight while labeling to improve the future quality of word prediction.We evaluated the labeling efficiency and the accuracy by comparing the conditions with and without IAM in our study. The results showed that participants' labeling efficiency increased significantly under the condition with IAM than the condition without IAM  while the two conditions maintained roughly the same labeling accuracy.
SketCHI 2.0: Hands-On Special Interest Group on Sketching in HCI,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Island A CROWNE,Makayla Lewis  Brunel University Miriam Sturdee  University of Calgary Jagoda Walny  University of Calgary Nicolai Marquardt  University College London Thuong Hoang  Deakin University Joanna Foster  University of Dundee Sheelagh Carpendale  University of Calgary,Sketching is universal. It enables us to work through problems  communicate complexity  work with people who have diverse needs  and document work processes we employ within Human-Computer Interaction. Increased interest in sketching as a methodology within HCI has led to increased attendance of interactive courses  meet-ups  and discussion groups  from those who are complete beginners  to seasoned researchers with the skills and knowledge to support others. By bringing together these individuals  we are able to advance the understanding of how sketching underpins research  and how we might work with sketching as technology advances. SketCHI 2.0 aims to support ongoing discussions and collaborations around sketching in HCI  and further build the Sketching HCI community. As well as drawing on location  feedback  and discussion  we will form collaborative working groups to further our collective interest in this area and conduct high-level discussions about the practical applications and outputs of sketching in HCI.
Communicating your Research to the Public and the Press,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Island B CROWNE,Helen Pilcher,Researchers are increasingly called upon to communicate with non-specialist audiences  but it can be difficult to communicate complex scientific topics in a way that makes them accessible and engaging to people outside the field. Further  interacting with the media can be daunting and frustrating and researchers frequently comment on how their work is misrepresented in the popular press. This course aims to give participants the skills needed to interact confidently with the media and to non-specialists  and get their key messages across.
HotStrokes: Word-Gesture Shortcuts on a Trackpad,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Lomond,Wenzhe Cui  Stony Brook University Jingjie Zheng  Google Blaine Lewis  University of Waterloo Daniel Vogel  University of Waterloo Xiaojun Bi  Stony Brook University,Expert interaction techniques like hotkeys are efficient  but poorly adopted because they are hard to learn. HotStrokes removes the need for learning arbitrary mappings of commands to hotkeys. A user enters a HotStroke by holding a modifier key  then gesture typing a command name on a laptop trackpad as if on an imaginary virtual keyboard. The gestures are recognized using an adaptation of the SHARK2 algorithm with a new spatial model and a refined method for dynamic suggestions. A controlled experiment shows HotStrokes effectively augments the existing "menu and hotkey" command activation paradigm. Results show the method is efficient by reducing command activation time by 43% compared to linear menus. The method is also easy to learn with a high adoption rate  replacing 91% of linear menu usage. Finally  combining linear menus  hotkeys  and HotStrokes leads to 24% faster command activation overall.
i'sFree: Eyes-Free Gesture Typing via a Touch-Enabled Remote Control,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Lomond,Suwen Zhu  Stony Brook University Jingjie Zheng  Google Shumin Zhai  Google Xiaojun Bi  Stony Brook University,Entering text without having to pay attention to the keyboard is compelling but challenging due to the lack of visual guidance. We propose i'sFree to enable eyes-free gesture typing on a distant display from a touch-enabled remote control. i'sFree does not display the keyboard or gesture trace but decodes gestures drawn on the remote control into text according to an invisible and shifting Qwerty layout. i'sFree decodes gestures similar to a general gesture typing decoder  but learns from the instantaneous and historical input gestures to dynamically adjust the keyboard location. We designed it based on the understanding of how users perform eyes-free gesture typing. Our evaluation shows eyes-free gesture typing is feasible: reducing visual guidance on the distant display hardly affects the typing speed. Results also show that the i'sFree gesture decoding algorithm is effective  enabling an input speed of 23 WPM  46% faster than the baseline eyes-free condition built on a general gesture decoder. Finally  i'sFree is easy to learn: participants reached 22 WPM in the first ten minutes  even though 40% of them were first-time gesture typing users.
VIPBoard: Improving Screen-Reader Keyboard for Visually Impaired People with Character-Level Auto Correction,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Lomond,Weinan Shi  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Chun Yu  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Shuyi Fan  Tsinghua University Feng Wang  Tsinghua University Tong Wang  Tsinghua University Xin Yi  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Xiaojun Bi  Stony Brook University Yuanchun Shi  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education,Modern touchscreen keyboards are all powered by the word-level auto-correction ability to handle input errors. Unfortunately  visually impaired users are deprived of such benefit because a screen-reader keyboard offers only character-level input and provides no correction ability. In this paper  we present VIPBoard  a smart keyboard for visually impaired people  which aims at improving the underlying keyboard algorithm without altering the current input interaction. Upon each tap  VIPBoard predicts the probability of each key considering both touch location and language model  and reads the most likely key  which saves the calibration time when the touchdown point misses the target key. Meanwhile  the keyboard layout automatically scales according to users' touch point location  which enables them to select other keys easily. A user study shows that compared with the current keyboard technique  VIPBoard can reduce touch error rate by 63.0% and increase text entry speed by 12.6%.
VelociWatch: Designing and Evaluating a Virtual Keyboard for the Input of Challenging Text,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 11:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 12:20,Lomond,Keith Vertanen  Michigan Technological University Dylan Gaines  Michigan Technological University Crystal Fletcher  Michigan Technological University Alex M. Stanage  Michigan Technological University Robbie Watling  Michigan Technological University Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge,Virtual keyboard typing is typically aided by an auto-correct method that decodes a user's noisy taps into their intended text. This decoding process can reduce error rates and possibly increase entry rates by allowing users to type faster but less precisely. However  virtual keyboard decoders sometimes make mistakes that change a user's desired word into another. This is particularly problematic for challenging text such as proper names. We investigate whether users can guess words that are likely to cause auto-correct problems and whether users can adjust their behavior to assist the decoder. We conduct computational experiments to decide what predictions to offer in a virtual keyboard and design a smartwatch keyboard named VelociWatch. Novice users were able to use the features of VelociWatch to enter challenging text at 17 words-per-minute with a corrected error rate of 3%. Interestingly  they wrote slightly faster and just as accurately on a simpler keyboard with limited correction options. Our finding suggest users may be able to type difficult words on a smartwatch simply by tapping precisely without the use of auto-correct.

Casual Microtasking: Embedding Microtasks in Facebook,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Nathan Hahn  Carnegie Mellon University Shamsi Iqbal  Microsoft Research Jaime Teevan  Microsoft Research,Microtasks enable people with limited time and context to contribute to a larger task. In this paper we explore casual microtasking  where microtasks are embedded into other primary activities so that they are available to be completed when convenient. We present a casual microtasking experience that inserts writing microtasks from an existing microwriting tool into the user's Facebook feed. From a two-week deployment of the system with nine people  we observe that casual microtasking enabled participants to get things done during their breaks  and that they tended to do so only after first engaging with Facebook's social content. Participants were most likely to complete the writing microtasks during periods of the day associated with low focus  and would occasionally use them as a springboard to open the original document in Word. These findings suggest casual microtasking can help people leverage spare micromoments to achieve meaningful micro-goals  and even encourage them to return to work.
Geollery: A Mixed Reality Social Media Platform,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Ruofei Du  University of Maryland  College Park David Li  University of Maryland  College Park Amitabh Varshney  University of Maryland  College Park,We present Geollery  an interactive mixed reality social media platform for creating  sharing  and exploring geotagged information. Geollery introduces a real-time pipeline to progressively render an interactive mirrored world with three-dimensional (3D) buildings  internal user-generated content  and external geotagged social media. This mirrored world allows users to see  chat  and collaborate with remote participants with the same spatial context in an immersive virtual environment. We describe the system architecture of Geollery  its key interactive capabilities  and our design decisions. Finally  we conduct a user study with 20 participants to qualitatively compare Geollery with another social media system  Social Street View. Based on the participants' responses  we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each system and derive key insights for designing an interactive mirrored world with geotagged social media. User feedback from our study reveals several use cases for Geollery including travel planning  virtual meetings  and family gathering.
Discovering Alternative Treatments for Opioid Use Recovery Using Social Media,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Stevie Chancellor  Georgia Institute of Technology George Nitzburg  Teachers' College  Columbia University Andrea Hu  Georgia Institute of Technology Francisco Zampieri  Georgia Institute of Technology Munmun De Choudhury  Georgia Institute of Technology,Opioid use disorder (OUD) poses substantial risks to personal well-being and public health. In online communities  users support those seeking recovery  in part by promoting clinically grounded treatments. However  some communities also promote clinically unverified OUD treatments  such as unregulated and untested drugs. Little research exists on which alternative treatments people use  whether these treatments are effective for recovery  or if they cause negative side effects. We provide the first large-scale social media study of clinically unverified  alternative treatments in OUD recovery on Reddit  partnering with an addiction research scientist. We adopt transfer learning across 63 subreddits to precisely identify posts related to opioid recovery. Then  we quantitatively discover potential alternative treatments and contextualize their effectiveness. Our work benefits health research and practice by identifying undiscovered recovery strategies. We also discuss the impacts to online communities dealing with stigmatized behavior and research ethics.
Everyday Experiences: Small Stories and Mental Illness on Instagram,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University Anne Marie Piper  Northwestern University,Despite historical precedence and modern prevalence  mental illness and associated disorders are frequently aligned with notions of deviance and  by association  abnormality. The view that mental illness deviates from an implicit social norm permeates the CHI community  impacting how scholars approach research in this space. In this paper  we challenge community and societal norms aligning mental illness with deviance. We combine semi-structured interviews with digital ethnography of public Instagram accounts to examine how Instagram users express mental illness. Drawing on small stories research  we find that individuals situate mental illness within their everyday lives and negotiate their tellings of experience due to the influence of various social control structures. We discuss implications for incorporating 'the everyday' into the design of technological solutions for marginalized communities and the ways in which researchers and designers may inadvertently perpetuate and instantiate stigma related to mental illness.
Beyond Tutoring: Opportunities for Intergenerational Mentorship at a Community Level,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Ye Yuan  University of Minnesota Svetlana Yarosh  University of Minnesota,Community intergenerational mentorship offers an opportunity to address older adults' social isolation while providing valuable one-on-one or small group learning experiences for elementary school students. Current organizations that support this kind of engagement focus on in-person visits that place the burden of logistics and transportation on the older adult. However  as older adults become less independent while aging  coming to schools in person becomes more challenging. We present a qualitative analysis of current intergenerational mentorship practices to understand opportunities for technology to expand access to this experience. We highlight elements critical for building successful mentorship: the importance of relationship building between older adults and children during mentoring activities  the skills mentors acquired to carry out mentoring activities  and support needed from teachers and schools. We contribute a rich description of current intergenerational mentorship practices and provide insights for opportunities for novel HCI technologies in this context.
Dynamics of Visual Attention in Multiparty Collaborative Problem Solving using Multidimensional Recurrence Quantification Analysis,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Hana Vrzakova  University of Colorado Boulder Mary Jean Amon  University of Colorado Boulder Angela E. B. Stewart  University of Colorado Boulder Sidney K. D'Mello  University of Colorado Boulder,Multiparty collaborative problem solving - an increasingly important context in the 21st century workforce - suffers from a degradation of social and behavioral signals when attempted remotely  resulting in suboptimal outcomes. We investigate teams' multidimensional patterns of visual attention during a collaborative problem-solving task with an eye for leveraging insights to improve collaborative interfaces. Fifty-seven novices (forming 19 triads) engaged in a challenging programming task (Minecraft Hour of Code) using videoconferencing software with screen sharing. To discover patterns of individual-level gaze-UI coupling(coordination of a teammate's attention with respect to changes in the user interface) and team-level gaze-UI regularity (dynamics of teams' collective attention in context with changes in the user interface)  we applied cross- and multidimensional recurrence quantification analyses  respectively. Individuals' eye gaze was significantly coupled with the ongoing screen activity whereas teams displayed significant patterns of gaze regularity  suggesting repetitive patterns in teams' attention. These measures predicted expert-coded collaborative processes of constructing shared knowledge and negotiation and coordination (but not maintaining team function) and correlated with task score (r = .425). They also predicted individually assessed subjective perceptions of team performance and the collaboration process  but not individual's learning or team's task scores. We discuss implications of our findings for the design of intelligent collaborative interfaces.
Towards Collaboration Translucence: Giving Meaning to Multimodal Group Data,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Vanessa Echeverria  University of Technology Sydney & Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral Roberto Martinez-Maldonado  University of Technology Sydney Simon Buckingham Shum  University of Technology Sydney,Collocated  face-to-face teamwork remains a pervasive mode of working  which is hard to replicate online. Team members' embodied  multimodal interaction with each other and artefacts has been studied by researchers  but due to its complexity  has remained opaque to automated analysis. However  the ready availability of sensors makes it increasingly affordable to instrument work spaces to study teamwork and groupwork. The possibility of visualising key aspects of a collaboration has huge potential for both academic and professional learning  but a frontline challenge is the enrichment of quantitative data streams with the qualitative insights needed to make sense of them. In response  we introduce the concept of collaboration translucence  an approach to make visible selected features of group activity. This is grounded both theoretically (in the physical  epistemic  social and affective dimensions of group activity)  and contextually (using domain-specific concepts). We illustrate the approach from the automated analysis of healthcare simulations to train nurses  generating four visual proxies that fuse multimodal data into higher order patterns.
Mazi: Tangible Technologies as a Channel for Collaborative Play,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Antonella Nonnis  Queen Mary University of London Nick Bryan-Kinns  Queen Mary University of London,This paper investigates how haptic and auditory stimulation can be playfully implemented as an accessible and stimulating form of interaction for children. We present the design of Mazi  a sonic Tangible User Interface (TUI) designed to encourage spontaneous and collaborative play between children with high support needs autism. We report on a five week study of Mazi with five children aged between 6 and 9 years old at a Special Education Needs (SEN) school in London  UK. We found that collaborative play emerged from the interaction with the system especially in regards to socialization and engagement. Our study contributes to exploring the potential of user-centered TUI development as a channel to facilitate social interaction while providing sensory regulation for children with SENs.
Identifying the Intersections: User Experience + Research Scientist Collaboration in a Generative Machine Learning Interface,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Claire Kayacik  Google  Inc. Sherol Chen  Google  Inc. Signe Noerly  Google  Inc. Jess Holbrook  Google  Inc. Adam Roberts  Google  Inc. Douglas Eck  Google  Inc.,Creative generative machine learning interfaces are stronger when multiple actors bearing different points of view actively contribute to them. User experience (UX) research and design involvement in the creation of machine learning (ML) models help ML research scientists to more effectively identify human needs that ML models will fulfill. The People and AI Research (PAIR) group within Google developed a novel program method in which UXers are embedded into an ML research group for three months to provide a human-centered perspective on the creation of ML models. The first full-time cohort of UXers were embedded in a team of ML research scientists focused on deep generative models to assist in music composition. Here  we discuss the structure and goals of the program  challenges we faced during execution  and insights gained as a result of the process. We offer practical suggestions for how to foster communication between UX and ML research teams and recommended UX design processes for building creative generative machine learning interfaces.
Translation  Tracks & Data: an Algorithmic Bias Effort in Practice,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Henriette Cramer  Spotify Jean Garcia-Gathright  Spotify Sravana Reddy  Spotify Aaron Springer  University of California  Santa Cruz Romain Takeo Bouyer  Spotify,Potential negative outcomes of machine learning and algorithmic bias have gained deserved attention. However  there are still relatively few standard processes to assess and address algorithmic biases in industry practice. Practical tools that integrate into engineers' workflows are needed. As a case study  we present two tooling efforts to create tools for teams in practice to address algorithmic bias. Both intend to increase understanding of data  models  and outcome measurement decisions. We describe the development of 1) a prototype checklist based on existing literature frameworks; and 2) dashboarding for quantitatively assessing outcomes at scale. We share both technical and organizational lessons learned on checklist perceptions  data challenges and interpretation pitfalls.
When Users Assist the Voice Assistants: From Supervision to Failure Resolution,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Dounia Lahoual  EDF R&D Myriam Frejus  EDF R&D,We conducted an in situ study of six households in domestic and driving situations in order to better understand how voice assistants (VA) are used and evaluate the efficiency of vocal interactions in natural contexts. The filmed observations and interviews revealed activities of supervision  verification  diagnosis and problem-solving. These activities were not only costly in time  but they also interrupted the flow in the inhabitants' other activities. Although the VAs were expected to facilitate the accomplishment of a second  simultaneous task  they in fact were a hindrance. Such failures can cause abandonment  but the results nevertheless revealed a paradox of use: the inhabitants forgave and accepted these errors  while continuing to appropriate the vocal system.
Should I Interfere? AI-Assistants' Interaction with Knowledge Workers: A Case Study in the Oil and Gas Industry,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Juliana Jansen Ferreira  IBM Research Ana Fucs  IBM Research Vinícius Segura  IBM Research,Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants have been a hot topic for a few years. Popular solutions – such as Google Assistant  Microsoft's Cortana  Apple's Siri  and Amazon Alexa – are becoming resourceful AI-assistants for general users. Apart from some mishaps  those assistants have a successful history in supporting people's everyday tasks. The same cannot be said in industry-specific scenarios  in which AI-assistants are still a bet. Companies combining AI with human expertise and experience can be stand out in their industry. This is particularly important for industries that rely their strategic decision-making processes on knowledge workers actions. More than another system  AI-assistants are new players in the human-computer interaction. But how and when should an AI-assistant interfere in a knowledge worker task? In this paper  we present findings from a case study using the Wizard of Oz approach in an oil and gas company. Our findings begin to answer that question for what kind of interference knowledge workers in that domain would accept from an AI-assistant.
Insights in Experimental Data through Intuitive and Interactive Statistics,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Jean-Bernard Martens  Eindhoven University of Technology,It is not unusual for empirical scientists  who are often not specialists in statistics  to have only limited trust in the statistical analyses that they apply to their data. The claim of this course is that an improved human-computer interaction with statistical methods can be accomplished by providing a simple mental model of what statistics does  and to support this model through well-chosen visualizations and interactive exploration. In order to support this proposed approach  an entirely new program for performing interactive statistics  called ILLMO  was developed. This course will use examples of frequent statistical tasks such as hypothesis testing  linear regression and clustering to introduce the key concepts underlying intuitive and interactive statistics.
Ethnographic Methods for Human Factors Researchers: Collecting and Interweaving Threads of HCI,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Argyll 3 CROWNE,Frauke Mörike  Technische Universität Berlin,This course offers an introduction to ethnography for Human Factors Research. It covers relevant topics along the research process from decision arguments for the method and study design  up to data collection  analysis and interpretation. Ethical questions will include the researcher's role(s) in the field and modes of data presentation. The collection of multi-dimensional sets of data – a trademark of high-quality ethnographic work – enables inter-weaving threads of HCI perspectives in complex human factors and user research contexts. To achieve this  a comprehensive toolbox of ethnographic methods is introduced along with practical hands-on sessions to familiarize with these methodological instruments.
The Smartphone as a Pacifier and its Consequences: Young adults' smartphone usage in moments of solitude and correlations to self-reflection,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Sarah Diefenbach  Ludwig Maximilians University Munich Kim Borrmann  Ludwig Maximilians University Munich,The smartphone plays a dominant role in everyday life. Among young adults  the average daily usage time is almost four hours. The present study [N=399] examines the specific psychological role of smartphone usage during alone time (e.g. in the subway  waiting  in bed). Particularly  we explore its role in coping with negative emotions in the sense of an "attachment object"  providing comfort like a pacifier for infants. Results underlined the pacifying role of smartphone usage to cope with negative emotions in moments of alone time. Moreover  particular personality dispositions (e.g.  high need to belong  high proneness to boredom) were associated with more extensive self-reported smartphone usage and mediated by the perception of the smartphone as an attachment object. Finally  smartphone usage was negatively correlated to self-insight  possibly substituting intense inner debates or self-realizations during alone time. Implications for HCI research and practice are discussed.
Long-Term Value of Social Robots through the Eyes of Expert Users,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Dmitry Dereshev  Northumbria University at Newcastle David Kirk  Northumbria University at Newcastle Kohei Matsumura  Ritsumeikan University Toshiyuki Maeda  Hannan University,Socially-enabled digital technologies have attracted academic interest for decades  with recent commercial examples of Siri and Alexa  capturing public attention. However  despite ubiquitous visions of a robotic future  very few fully-fledged social robots are currently available to consumers. To improve their designs  studies of their long-term use are particularly valuable  but are currently unavailable. To address this gap  we report on interviews with four long-term users of Pepper - a social robot introduced in 2014. Our thematic analysis elicited insights across three kinds of value Pepper brought to its users: utilitarian functionality; the community that formed around Pepper; and a personal value of affection. We focus on two contributions those values bring to social robot design: social robots as social proxies  alleviating disabilities or acting akin to social media profiles; and robot nurturing as a design construct  going beyond purely utilitarian or hedonistic perspectives on robots.
Design and Evaluation of Service Robot's Proactivity in Decision-Making Support Process,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Zhenhui Peng  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Yunhwan Kwon  Dongguk University Jiaan Lu  University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute Ziming Wu  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Xiaojuan Ma  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,As service robots are envisioned to provide decision-making support (DMS) in public places  it is becoming essential to design the robot's manner of offering assistance. For example  robot shop assistants that proactively or reactively give product recommendations may impact customers' shopping experience. In this paper  we propose an anticipation-autonomy policy framework that models three levels of proactivity (high  medium and low) of service robots in DMS contexts. We conduct a within-subject experiment with 36 participants to evaluate the effects of DMS robot's proactivity on user perceptions and interaction behaviors. Results show that a highly proactive robot is deemed inappropriate though people can get rich information from it. A robot with medium proactivity helps reduce the decision space while maintaining users' sense of engagement. The least proactive robot grants users more control but may not realize its full capability. We conclude the paper with design considerations for service robot's manner.
Turn to the Self in Human-Computer Interaction: Care of the Self in Negotiating the Human-Technology Relationship,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Yubo Kou  Florida State University Xinning Gui  University of California  Irvine Yunan Chen  University of California  Irvine Bonnie Nardi  University of California  Irvine,Everyday life is increasingly mediated by technology. Technology is rapidly growing capacity and complexity  especially evident in developments in artificial intelligence and big data analytics. As human-computer interaction (HCI) endeavors to examine and theorize how people act and interact with the ever-evolving technology  an important  emerging concern is how the self—the totality of internal qualities such as consciousness and agency—plays out in relation to the technology-mediated external world. To analyze this question  we draw from Michel Foucault's ethics of "care of the self " which examines how the self is constituted through conscious and reflective work on self-transformation. We present three case studies to illustrate how individuals carry out practices of the self to reflect upon and negotiate their relationship with technology. We discuss the importance of examining the self and foreground the notion of care of the self in HCI research and design.
The Magic Machine Workshops: Making Personal Design Knowledge,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Kristina Andersen  Eindhoven University of Technology Ron Wakkary  Eindhoven University of Technology & Simon Fraser University,New technologies emerge into an increasingly complex everyday life. How can we engage users further into material practices that explore ideas and notions of these new things? This paper proposes a set of qualities for short  intense  workshop-like experiences  created to generate strong individual commitments  and expose underlying personal desires as drivers for ideas. By making use of open-ended making to engage participants in the imagination of new things  we aim to allow a broad range of knowledge to materialise  focused on the making of work that is about technology  rather than of technology.
From HCI to HCI-Amusement: Strategies for Engaging what New Technology Makes Old,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Laura Devendorf  University of Colorado Boulder Kristina Andersen  Eindhoven University of Technology Daniela K. Rosner  University of Washington Ron Wakkary  Simon Fraser University & Eindhoven University of Technology James Pierce  California College of the Arts & University of California  Berkeley,Notions of what counts as a contribution to HCI continue to be contested as our field expands to accommodate perspectives from the arts and humanities. This paper aims to advance the position of the arts and further contribute to these debates by actively exploring what a "non-contribution" would look like in HCI. We do this by taking inspiration from Fluxus  a collective of artists in the 1950's and 1960's who actively challenged and reworked practices of fine arts institutions by producing radically accessible  ephemeral  and modest works of "art-amusement." We use Fluxus to develop three analogous forms of "HCI-amusements " each of which shed light on dominant practices and values within HCI by resisting to fit into its logics.
Automating the Intentional Encoding of Human-Designable Markers,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Joshua D.A. Jung  University of Waterloo Rahul N. Iyer  University of Waterloo Daniel Vogel  University of Waterloo,Recent work established that it is possible for human artists to encode information into hand-drawn markers  but it is difficult to do when simultaneously maintaining aesthetic quality. We present two methods for relieving the mental burden associated with encoding  while allowing an artist to draw as freely as possible. A 'Helper Overlay' guides the artist with real-time feedback indicating where visual features should be added or removed  and an 'Autocomplete Tool' directly adds necessary features to the drawing for the artist to touch up. Both methods are enabled by a two-part algorithm that uses a tree-search for finding 'major' changes and a dynamic programming method for finding the minimum number of 'minor' changes. A 24-person study demonstrates that a majority of participants prefer both tools over previous methods of manual encoding  with the Helper Overlay being the more popular of the two.
Shaping Pro-Social Interaction in VR: An Emerging Design Framework,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Joshua McVeigh-Schultz  University of California  Santa Cuz Anya Kolesnichenko  University of California  Santa Cruz Katherine Isbister  University of California  Santa Cruz,Commercial social VR applications represent a diverse and evolving ecology with competing models of what it means to be social in VR. Drawing from expert interviews  this paper examines how the creators of different social VR applications think about how their platforms frame  support  shape  or constrain social interaction. The study covers a range of applications including: Rec Room  High Fidelity  VRChat  Mozilla Hubs  Altspace VR  AnyLand  and Facebook Spaces. We contextualize design choices underlying these applications  with particular attention paid to the ways that industry experts perceive  and seek to shape  the relationship between user experiences and design choices. We underscore considerations related to: (1) aesthetics of place (2) embodied affordances  (3) social mechanics  (4) and tactics for shaping social norms and mitigating harassment. Drawing on this analysis  we discuss the stakes of these choices  suggest future research directions  and propose an emerging design framework for shaping pro-social behavior in VR.
Embodied Imagination: An Approach to Stroke Recovery Combining Participatory Performance and Interactive Technology,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Rosella P. Galindo Esparza  Queen Mary University of London Patrick Healey  Queen Mary University of London Lois Weaver  Queen Mary University of London Matthew Delbridge  Melbourne University,Participatory performance provides methods for exploring social identities and situations in ways that can help people to imagine new ways of being. Digital technologies provide tools that can help people envision these possibilities. We explore this combination through a performance workshop process designed to help stroke survivors imagine new physical and social possibilities by enacting fantasies of "things they always wanted to do". This process uses performance methods combined with specially designed real-time movement visualisations to progressively build fantasy narratives that are enacted with and for other workshop participants. Qualitative evaluations suggest this process successfully stimulates participant's embodied imagination and generates a diverse range of fantasies. The interactive and communal aspects of the workshop process appear to be especially important in achieving these effects. This work highlights how the combination of performance methods and interactive tools can bring a rich  prospective and political understanding of people's lived experience to design.
Using Both Hands: Tangibles for Stroke Rehabilitation in the Home,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Mikko Kytö  Aalto University & University of Helsinki Laura Maye  Aalto University & University College Cork David McGookin  Aalto University,Stroke is one of the most common cause of long-term disability in the world  significantly reducing quality of life through impairing motor functions and cognitive abilities. Whilst rehabilitation exercises can help in the recovery of motor function impairments  stroke survivors rarely exercise enough  leading to far from optimal recovery. In this paper  we investigate how upper limb stroke rehabilitation can be supported using interactive tangible bimanual devices in the home. We customise the rehabilitation activities based on individual rehabilitation requirements and motivation of stroke survivors. Through evaluation with five stroke survivors  we uncovered insight into how tangible stroke rehabilitation systems for the home should be designed. The evaluation revealed the special importance of tailorable form factor and supporting self-awareness and grip exercises in order to increase the independency of stroke survivors to carry out activities of daily living.
Supporting Coping with Parkinson's Disease Through Self Tracking,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Sonali R. Mishra  University of Washington Predrag Klasnja  University of Michigan John MacDuffie Woodburn  Sage Bionetworks Eric B. Hekler  University of California San Diego Larsson Omberg  Sage Bionetworks Michael Kellen  Sage Bionetworks Lara Mangravite  Sage Bionetworks,Self-tracking can help people understand their medical condition and the factors that influence their symptoms. However  it is unclear how tracking technologies should be tailored to help people cope with the progression of a degenerative disease. To understand how smartphone apps and other tracking technologies can support people in coping with an incurable illness  we interviewed both people with Parkinson's Disease (n=17) and care partners (n=6) who help people with Parkinson's manage their lives. We describe how symptom trackers can help people identify and solve problems to improve their quality of life  the role symptom trackers can play in helping people combat their own tendencies towards avoidance and denial  and the complex role of care partners in defining and tracking ambiguous symptoms. Our findings yield insights that can guide the design of tracking technologies to help people with Parkinson's Disease accept and plan for their condition.
What Can Gestures Tell? Detecting Motor Impairment in Early Parkinson's from Common Touch Gestural Interactions,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Feng Tian  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Xiangmin Fan  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Junjun Fan  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Yicheng Zhu  Peking Union Medical College Hospital Jing Gao  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Dakuo Wang  IBM T.J. Watson Research Center Xiaojun Bi  Stony Brook University Hongan Wang  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurological disorder causing progressive disability that severely affects patients' quality of life. Although early interventions can provide significant benefits  PD diagnosis is often delayed due to both the mildness of early signs and the high requirements imposed by traditional screening and diagnosis methods. In this paper  we explore the feasibility and accuracy of detecting motor impairment in early PD via sensing and analyzing users' common touch gestural interactions on smartphones. We investigate four types of common gestures  including flick  drag  pinch  and handwriting gestures  and propose a set of features to capture PD motor signs. Through a 102-subject (35 early PD subjects and 67 age-matched controls) study  our approach achieved an AUC of 0.95 and 0.89/0.88 sensitivity/specificity in discriminating early PD subjects from healthy controls. Our work constitutes an important step towards unobtrusive  implicit  and convenient early PD detection from routine smartphone interactions.
A Mulching Proposal: Analysing and Improving an Algorithmic System for Turning the Elderly into High-Nutrient Slurry,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Os Keyes  University of Washington Jevan Hutson  University of Washington Meredith Durbin  University of Washington,The ethical implications of algorithmic systems have been much discussed in both HCI and the broader community of those interested in technology design  development and policy. In this paper  we explore the application of one prominent ethical framework—Fairness  Accountability  and Transparency—to a proposed algorithm that resolves various societal issues around food security and population ageing. Using various standardised forms of algorithmic audit and evaluation  we drastically increase the algorithm's adherence to the FAT framework  resulting in a more ethical and beneficent system. We discuss how this might serve as a guide to other researchers or practitioners looking to ensure better ethical outcomes from algorithmic systems in their line of work.
Imaginary Studies: A Science Fiction Autoethnography Concerning the Design  Implementation and Evaluation of a Fictional Quantitative Study to Evaluate the Umamimi Robotic Horse Ears,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Steve North  University of Exeter,In this paper  I use 'science fiction autoethnography' to reflect on conducting an imaginary  quantitative study. My fictional study is intended to evaluate a real-life artefact: the 'umamimi' robotic horse ears. This physical device provides a backdrop  against which my experiences and self-reflections are used to critique quantitative 'hard science'. My own cognitive bias  rigid attachment to a viewpoint and presumptions (concerning anticipated results) all provide the real story. When I conduct an imaginary study  what does the process and its speculative results say about my autobiographical story and both the object and subject's broader societal and cultural meanings?
Of Mice and Pants: Queering the Conventional Gamer Mouse for Cooperative Play,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Sabine Harrer  University of Tampere Simon Nielsen  Copenhagen Game Collective Patrick Jarnfelt  Copenhagen Game Collective,Withing the fields of HCI and game design  conventional design practices have been criticised for perpetuating the status quo and marginalising users beyond the norm [11]  [1]  e.g. through genderized assumptions about user interaction [13]. To solve this problem of conservatism in HCI  one recommended strategy has been queering; the use of mischiveous  spaceful  and oblique design principles [13]. This contribution focuses on the conventional computer mouse within videogames as an example for a conventional input device optimised for a limited set of interactions. The article first reviews HCI discourses on the mouse within technology studies  game culture  and queer game studies. In these three domains  the mouse has been consistently reduced to its functionality as high-precision point-and-click device  constructing it as conservative seemingly hard-wired to cater to male-centred pleasures. We then discuss three experimental game design strategies to queer the mouse controller in The Undie Game  a cooperative wearable mouse-based installation game by the Copenhagen Game Collective. The Undie Game speculates about ways to confront and disrupt conventional expectations about gaming by fa''silly''tating interaction for two players who wear a mouse controller in their panties and collectively steer a 3D high definition tongue on screen to achieve a mutual highscore. By creating a social  silly  and potentially daunting play experience  The Undie Game reinterprets the affordances of the computer mouse to bring subjects like consent  failure  and ambiguity into the picture.
Models of Minds: Reading the Mind Beyond the Brain,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Nick Merrill  University of California  Berkeley John Chuang  University of California  Berkeley,Drawing on philosophies of embodied  distributed & extend cognition  this paper argues that the mind is readable from sensors worn on the body and embedded in the environment. It contends that past work in HCI has already begun such work  introducing the term models of minds to describe it. To those who wish to develop the capacity to build models of minds  we argue that notions of the mind are entangled with the technologies that seek to sense it. Drawing on the racial and gendered history of surveillance  we advocate for future work on how models of minds may reinforce existing vulnerabilities  and create new ones.
Conceptual Models: Core to Good Design,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,Jeff A. Johnson  University of San Francisco,A crucial step in designing a user interface for a software application is to design a coherent  task-focused conceptual model (CM). With a CM  designers design better  developers develop better  and users learn and use better. Unfortunately  this step is often skipped  resulting in incoherent  arbitrary  inconsistent  overly-complex applications that impede design  development  learning  understanding  and use. This course covers what CMs are  how they help  how to develop them  and provides hands-on experience.
Design for Wellbeing – Tools for Research  Practice and Ethics,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Rafael A. Calvo  University of Cambridge & University of Sydney Dorian Peters  University of Cambridge & University of Sydney,Any move towards more ethical design and technologies that genuinely improve our lives requires that those technologies respect our psychological needs. Currently  there is no systematic integration of wellbeing science into tech development  and the many technology-induced harms to mental health  reported in the media daily  attest to this deficit. But the status quo is changing. A demand for more "Humane Technologies" [12] is forcing companies to rethink digital business as usual. Fortunately  recent research has uncovered new ways to make psychologically respectful technologies possible. Just as we can design ergonomically to support physical wellness  we can design psycho-ergonomically to support psychological health. By integrating well-evidenced theory and methods from multiple disciplines  we can design and develop new technologies to "do no harm" and even increase psychological wellbeing [1]. In this course we will introduce frameworks for designing technologies that respect human values and wellbeing [6 7 8 9 10] together with an established ethical framework within which to situate this design for flourishing [11]. We also provide practical tools for ideation  design  and the evaluation of the psychological impact of products.
Balancing Interaction Design,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Gilbert Cockton  Northumbria University,Over the last two decades  creative  lean and strategic design approaches have become increasingly prevalent in the development of interactive technologies  but tensions exist with longer established approaches such as human factors engineering and user-centered design. These tensions can be harnessed productively by first giving equal status in principle to creative  business and agile engineering practices  and then supporting this with flexible critical approaches and resources that can balance and integrate across a range of multidisciplinary design practices.
Resilient Chatbots: Repair Strategy Preferences for Conversational Breakdowns,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Zahra Ashktorab  IBM Research AI Mohit Jain  IBM Research Q. Vera Liao  IBM Research AI Justin D. Weisz  IBM Research AI,Text-based conversational systems  also referred to as chatbots  have grown widely popular. Current natural language understanding technologies are not yet ready to tackle the complexities in conversational interactions. Breakdowns are common  leading to negative user experiences. Guided by communication theories  we explore user preferences for eight repair strategies  including ones that are common in commercially-deployed chatbots (e.g.  confirmation  providing options)  as well as novel strategies that explain characteristics of the underlying machine learning algorithms. We conducted a scenario-based study to compare repair strategies with Mechanical Turk workers (N=203). We found that providing options and explanations were generally favored  as they manifest initiative from the chatbot and are actionable to recover from breakdowns. Through detailed analysis of participants' responses  we provide a nuanced understanding on the strengths and weaknesses of each repair strategy.
Exploring Virtual Agents for Augmented Reality,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Isaac Wang  University of Florida Jesse Smith  University of Florida Jaime Ruiz  University of Florida,Prior work has shown that embodiment can benefit virtual agents  such as increasing rapport and conveying non-verbal information. However  it is unclear if users prefer an embodied to a speech-only agent for augmented reality (AR) headsets that are designed to assist users in completing real-world tasks. We conducted a study to examine users' perceptions and behaviors when interacting with virtual agents in AR. We asked 24 adults to wear the Microsoft HoloLens and find objects in a hidden object game while interacting with an agent that would offer assistance. We presented participants with four different agents: voice-only  non-human  full-size embodied  and a miniature embodied agent. Overall  users preferred the miniature embodied agent due to the novelty of his size and reduced uncanniness as opposed to the larger agent. From our results  we draw conclusions about how agent representation matters and derive guidelines on designing agents for AR headsets.
Caring for Vincent: A Chatbot for Self-Compassion,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Minha Lee  Technical University of Eindhoven Sander Ackermans  Technical University of Eindhoven Nena van As  Technical University of Eindhoven Hanwen Chang  Technical University of Eindhoven Enzo Lucas  Technical University of Eindhoven Wijnand A. IJsselsteijn  Technical University of Eindhoven,The digitization of mental health care holds promises of affordable and ubiquitously available treatment  e.g.  with conversational agents (chatbots). While technology can guide people to care for themselves  we examined how people can care for another being as a way to care for themselves. We created a self-compassion chatbot (Vincent) and compared between caregiving and care-receiving conditions. Care-giving Vincent asked participants to partake in self-compassion exercises. Care-receiving Vincent shared its foibles  e.g.  embarrassingly arriving late at an IP address  and sought out advice. While self-compassion increased for both conditions  only those with care-receiving Vincent significantly improved. In tandem  we offer qualitative data on how participants interacted with Vincent. Our exploratory research shows that when a person cares for a chatbot  the person's self-compassion can be enhanced. We further reflect on design implications for strengthening mental health with chatbots.
What Makes a Good Conversation? Challenges in Designing Truly Conversational Agents,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Leigh Clark  University College Dublin Nadia Pantidi  University College Cork Orla Cooney  University College Dublin Philip Doyle  Voysis Ltd. Diego Garaialde  University College Dublin Justin Edwards  University College Dublin Brendan Spillane  Trinity College Dublin Emer Gilmartin  Trinity College Dublin Christine Murad  University of Toronto Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto Mississauga Vincent Wade  Trinity College Dublin Benjamin R. Cowan  University College Dublin,Conversational agents promise conversational interaction but fail to deliver. Efforts often emulate functional rules from human speech  without considering key characteristics that conversation must encapsulate. Given its potential in supporting long-term human-agent relationships  it is paramount that HCI focuses efforts on delivering this promise. We aim to understand what people value in conversation and how this should manifest in agents. Findings from a series of semi-structured interviews show people make a clear dichotomy between social and functional roles of conversation  emphasising the long-term dynamics of bond and trust along with the importance of context and relationship stage in the types of conversations they have. People fundamentally questioned the need for bond and common ground in agent communication  shifting to more utilitarian definitions of conversational qualities. Drawing on these findings we discuss key challenges for conversational agent design  most notably the need to redefine the design parameters for conversational agent interaction.
Managing Messes in Computational Notebooks,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Andrew Head  University of California  Berkeley Fred Hohman  Georgia Institute of Technology Titus Barik  Microsoft Steven M. Drucker  Microsoft Research Robert DeLine  Microsoft Research,Data analysts use computational notebooks to write code for analyzing and visualizing data. Notebooks help analysts iteratively write analysis code by letting them interleave code with output  and selectively execute cells. However  as analysis progresses  analysts leave behind old code and outputs  and overwrite important code  producing cluttered and inconsistent notebooks. This paper introduces code gathering tools  extensions to computational notebooks that help analysts find  clean  recover  and compare versions of code in cluttered  inconsistent notebooks. The tools archive all versions of code outputs  allowing analysts to review these versions and recover the subsets of code that produced them. These subsets can serve as succinct summaries of analysis activity or starting points for new analyses. In a qualitative usability study  12 professional analysts found the tools useful for cleaning notebooks and writing analysis code  and discovered new ways to use them  like generating personal documentation and lightweight versioning.
Towards Effective Foraging by Data Scientists to Find Past Analysis Choices,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Mary Beth Kery  Carnegie Mellon University Bonnie E John  Bloomberg L.P. Patrick O'Flaherty  Bloomberg L.P. Amber Horvath  Carnegie Mellon University Brad A. Myers  Carnegie Mellon University,Data scientists are responsible for the analysis decisions they make  but it is hard for them to track the process by which they achieved a result. Even when data scientists keep logs  it is onerous to make sense of the resulting large number of history records full of overlapping variants of code  output  plots  etc. We developed algorithmic and visualization techniques for notebook code environments to help data scientists forage for information in their history. To test these interventions  we conducted a think-aloud evaluation with 15 data scientists  where participants were asked to find specific information from the history of another person's data science project. The participants succeed on a median of 80% of the tasks they performed. The quantitative results suggest promising aspects of our design  while qualitative results motivated a number of design improvements. The resulting system  called Verdant  is released as an open-source extension for JupyterLab.
The Scale and Structure of Personal File Collections,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Jesse David Dinneen  Victoria University of Wellington Charles-Antoine Julien  McGill University Ilja Frissen  McGill University,Although many challenges of managing computer files have been identified in past studies -- and many alternative prototypes made -- the scale and structure of personal file collections remain relatively unknown. We studied 348 such collections  and found they are typically considerably larger in scale (30-190 thousand files) and structure (folder trees twice taller and many times wider) than previously thought  which suggests files and folders are used now more than ever despite advances in Web storage  desktop search  and tagging. Data along many measures within and across collections were log normally distributed  indicating that personal collections resemble imbalanced  group-made collections and confirming the intuition that personal information management behaviour varies greatly. Directions for the generation of test collections and other future research are discussed.
Comparing Apples and Oranges: Taxonomy and Design of Pairwise Comparisons within Tabular Data,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Po-Ming Law  Georgia Institute of Technology Subhajit Das  Georgia Institute of Technology Rahul C. Basole  Georgia Institute of Technology,Asking pairwise comparison questions is common. Yet  we often find ourselves comparing apples and oranges --- the two entities of interest are not readily comparable. To understand how technologies can extend our capabilities to conduct pairwise comparisons during data analysis  we analyzed pairwise comparison questions collected from crowd workers and propose a taxonomy of pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate how the taxonomy can be adopted by incorporating pairwise comparison capabilities into Duo  a spreadsheet application that supports comparing two groups of records in a data table. Duo decomposes a pairwise comparison question into rules and showcases sloppy rules  a query technique for specifying pairwise comparisons. We conducted a user study comparing sloppy rules and natural language. The findings suggest that for easier pairwise comparison tasks  the two techniques are comparable in efficiency and preference and that for more difficult pairwise comparison tasks  sloppy rules allow faster specification and are more preferable.
Towards an Effective Digital Literacy Intervention to Assist Returning Citizens with Job Search,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Ihudiya Finda Ogbonnaya-Ogburu  University of Michigan Kentaro Toyama  University of Michigan Tawanna R. Dillahunt  University of Michigan,Returning citizens (formerly incarcerated individuals) face great challenges finding employment  and these are exacerbated by the need for digital literacy in modern job search. Through 23 semi-structured interviews and a pilot digital literacy course with returning citizens in the Greater Detroit area  we explore tactics and needs with respect to job search and digital technology. Returning citizens exhibit great diversity  but overall  we find our participants to have striking gaps in digital literacy upon release  even as they are quickly introduced to smartphones by friends and family. They tend to have employable skills and ability to use offline social networks to find opportunities  but have little understanding of formal job search processes  online or offline. They mostly mirror mainstream use of mobile technology  but they have various reasons to avoid social media. These and other findings lead to recommendations for digital literacy programs for returning citizens.
Tough Times at Transitional Homeless Shelters: Considering the Impact of Financial Insecurity on Digital Security and Privacy,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Manya Sleeper  Google Tara Matthews  Independent Kathleen O'Leary  Google Anna Turner  Google Jill Palzkill Woelfer  Google Martin Shelton  Google Andrew Oplinger  Google Andreas Schou  Google Sunny Consolvo  Google,Addressing digital security and privacy issues can be particularly difficult for users who face challenging circumstances. We performed semi-structured interviews with residents and staff at 4 transitional homeless shelters in the U.S. San Francisco Bay Area (n=15 residents  3 staff) to explore their digital security and privacy challenges. Based on these interviews  we outline four tough times themes --- challenges experienced by our financially insecure participants that impacted their digital security and privacy --- which included: (1) limited financial resources  (2) limited access to reliable devices and Internet  (3) untrusted relationships  and (4) ongoing stress. We provide examples of how each theme impacts digital security and privacy practices and needs. We then use these themes to provide a framework outlining opportunities for technology creators to better support users facing security and privacy challenges related to financial insecurity.
Witchcraft and HCI: Morality  Modernity  and Postcolonial Computing in Rural Bangladesh,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Sharifa Sultana  Cornell University Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed  University of Toronto,While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on health and well-being is increasingly becoming more aware and inclusive of its social and political dimensions  spiritual practices are still largely overlooked there. For a large number of people around the world  especially in the global south  witchcraft  sorcery  and other occult practices are the primary means of achieving health  wealth  satisfaction  and happiness. Building on an eight-month long ethnography in six villages in Jessore  Bangladesh  this paper explores the knowledge  materials  and politics involved in the local witchcraft practices there. By drawing from a rich body of anthropological work on witchcraft  this paper discusses how those findings contribute to the broader issues in HCI around morality  modernity  and postcolonial computing. This paper concludes by recommending ways for smooth integration of traditional occult practices with HCI through design and policy. We argue for occult practices as an under-appreciated site for HCI to learn how to combat ideological hegemony.
Understanding Law Enforcement Strategies and Needs for Combating Human Trafficking,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Julia Deeb-Swihart  Georgia Institute of Technology Alex Endert  Georgia Institute of Technology Amy Bruckman  Georgia Institute of Technology,In working to rescue victims of human trafficking  law enforcement officers face a host of challenges. Working in complex  layered organizational structures  they face challenges of collaboration and communication. Online information is central to every phase of a human-trafficking investigation. With terabytes of available data such as sex work ads  policing is increasingly a big-data research problem. In this study  we interview sixteen law enforcement officers working to rescue victims of human trafficking to try to understand their computational needs. We highlight three major areas where future work in human-computer interaction can help. First  combating human trafficking requires advances in information visualization of large  complex  geospatial data  as victims are frequently forcibly moved across jurisdictions. Second  the need for unified information databases raises critical research issues of usable security and privacy. Finally  the archaic nature of information systems available to law enforcement raises policy issues regarding resource allocation for software development.

Instrumenting and Analyzing Fabrication Activities  Users  and Expertise,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Forth,Jun Gong  Autodesk Research & Dartmouth College Fraser Anderson  Autodesk Research George Fitzmaurice  Autodesk Research Tovi Grossman  Autodesk Research & University of Toronto,The recent proliferation of fabrication and making activities has introduced a large number of users to a variety of tools and equipment. Monitored  reactive and adaptive fabrication spaces are needed to provide personalized information  feedback and assistance to users. This paper explores the sensorization of making and fabrication activities  where the environment  tools  and users were considered to be separate entities that could be instrumented for data collection. From this exploration  we present the design of a modular system that can capture data from the varied sensors and infer contextual information. Using this system  we collected data from fourteen participants with varying levels of expertise as they performed seven representative making tasks. From the collected data  we predict which activities are being performed  which users are performing the activities  and what expertise the users have. We present several use cases of this contextual information for future interactive fabrication spaces.
AutoFritz: Autocomplete for Prototyping Virtual Breadboard Circuits,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Forth,Jo-Yu Lo  National Chiao Tung University Da-Yuan Huang  National Chiao Tung University Tzu-Sheng Kuo  National Taiwan University Chen-Kuo Sun  National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Jun Gong  Dartmouth College Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary Xing-Dong Yang  Dartmouth College Bing-Yu Chen  National Taiwan University,We propose autocomplete for the design and development of virtual breadboard circuits using software prototyping tools. With our system  a user inserts a component into the virtual breadboard  and it automatically provides a user with a list of suggested components. These suggestions complete or ex- tend the electronic functionality of the inserted component to save the user's time and reduce circuit error. To demon- strate the effectiveness of autocomplete  we implemented our system on Fritzing  a popular open source breadboard circuit prototyping software  used by novice makers. Our autocomplete suggestions were implemented based upon schematics from datasheets for standard components  as well as how components are used together from over 4000 circuit projects from the Fritzing community. We report the results of a controlled study with 16 participants  evaluating the effectiveness of autocomplete in the creation of virtual breadboard circuits  and conclude by sharing insights and directions for future research.
Pinpoint: A PCB Debugging Pipeline Using Interruptible Routing and Instrumentation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Forth,Evan Strasnick  Stanford University Sean Follmer  Stanford University Maneesh Agrawala  Stanford University,Difficulties in accessing  isolating  and iterating on the components and connections of a printed circuit board (PCB) create unique challenges in PCB debugging. Manual probing methods are slow and error prone  and even dedicated PCB testing equipment remains limited by its inability to modify the circuit during testing. We present Pinpoint  a tool that facilitates in-circuit PCB debugging through techniques such as programmatically probing signals  dynamically disconnecting components and subcircuits to test in isolation  and splicing in new elements to explore potential modifications. Pinpoint automatically instruments a PCB design and generates designs for a physical jig board that interfaces the user's PCB to our custom testing hardware and to software tools. We evaluate Pinpoint's ability to facilitate the debugging of various PCB issues by instrumenting and testing different classes of boards  as well as by characterizing its technical limitations and by soliciting feedback through a guided exploration with PCB designers.
Beyond Schematic Capture: Meaningful Abstractions for Better Electronics Design Tools,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Forth,Richard Lin  University of California  Berkeley Rohit Ramesh  University of California  Berkeley Antonio Iannopollo  University of California  Berkeley Alberto Sangiovanni Vincentelli  University of California  Berkeley Prabal Dutta  University of California  Berkeley Elad Alon  University of California  Berkeley Björn Hartmann  University of California  Berkeley,Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design tools are critical in helping users build non-trivial electronics devices. While recent work recognizes deficiencies with current tools and explores novel methods  little has been done to understand modern designers and their needs. To gain better insight into their practices  we interview fifteen electronics designers of a variety of backgrounds. Our open-ended  semi-structured interviews examine both overarching design flows and details of individual steps. One major finding was that most creative engineering work happens during system architecture  yet current tools operate at lower abstraction levels and create significant tedious work for designers. From that insight  we conceptualize abstractions and primitives for higher-level tools and elicit feedback from our participants on clickthrough mockups of design flows through an example project. We close with our observation on opportunities for improving board design tools and discuss generalizability of our findings beyond the electronics domain.
Healthy Lies: The Effects of Misrepresenting Player Health Data on Experience  Behavior  and Performance,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Gala,Jason Wuertz  University of New Brunswick Max V. Birk  Eindhoven University of Technology Scott Bateman  University of New Brunswick,Game designers use a variety of techniques that mislead players with the goal of inducing play experience. For example  designers may manipulate data displays of player health—showing they have less health than they actually do—to induce tension. While commonly used  players make decisions based on in-game data displays  raising the question of how misrepresentations impact behavior and performance  and whether this might have unintended consequences. To provide a better understanding of how data misrepresentation impacts play  we compare two versions of a game: one that displays health accurately and one that misrepresents health. Our results suggest that even subtle manipulations to data displays can have a measurable effect on behavior and performance  and these changes can help explain differences in experience. We show that data misrepresentations need to be designed carefully to avoid unintended effects. Our work provides new directions for research into the design of misrepresentation in games.
A Player-Centric Approach to Designing Spatial Skill Training Games,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Gala,Helen Wauck  University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Elisa D. Mekler  University of Basel Wai-Tat Fu  University of Illinois,Certain video games show promise as tools for training spatial skills  one of the strongest predictors of future success in STEM. However  little is known about the gaming preferences of those who would benefit the most from such interventions: low spatial skill students. To provide guidance on how to design training games for this population  we conducted a survey of 350 participants from three populations: online college-age  students from a low SES high school  and students from a high SES high school. Participants took a timed test of spatial skills and then answered questions about their demographics  gameplay habits  preferences  and motivations. The only predictors of spatial skill were gender and population: female participants from online and low SES high school populations had the lowest spatial skill. In light of these findings  we provide design recommendations for game-based spatial skill interventions targeting low spatial skill students.
What.Hack: Engaging Anti-Phishing Training Through a Role-playing Phishing Simulation Game,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Gala,Zikai Alex Wen  Cornell University Zhiqiu Lin  Cornell University Rowena Chen  Cornell University Erik Andersen  Cornell University,Phishing attacks are a major problem  as evidenced by the DNC hackings during the 2016 US presidential election  in which staff were tricked into sharing passwords by fake Google security emails  granting access to confidential information. Vulnerabilities such as these are due in part to insufficient and tiresome user training in cybersecurity. Ideally  we would have more engaging training methods that teach cybersecurity in an active and entertaining way. To address this need  we introduce the game What.Hack  which not only teaches phishing concepts but also simulates actual phishing attacks in a role-playing game to encourage the player to practice defending themselves. Our user study shows that our game design is more engaging and effective in improving performance than a standard form of training and a competing training game design (which does not simulate phishing attempts through role-playing).
What's Missing: The Role of Instructional Design in Children's Games-Based Learning,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Gala,Laura Benton  University College London Asimina Vasalou  University College London Wolmet Barendregt  University of Gothenburg Leona Bunting  University of Gothenburg Andrea Révész  University College London,Learning games that address targeted curriculum areas are widely used in schools. Within games  productive learning episodes can result from breakdowns when followed by a breakthrough  yet their role in children's learning has not been investigated. This paper examines the role of game and instructional design during and after breakdowns. We observed 26 young children playing several popular learning games and conducted a moment-by-moment analysis of breakdown episodes. Our findings show children achieve productive breakthroughs independently less than half of the time. In particular  breakdowns caused by game actions are difficult for children to overcome independently and prevent engagement with the domain skills. Importantly  we identify specific instructional game components and their role in fostering strategies that result in successful breakthroughs. We conclude with intrinsic and extrinsic instructional design implications for both game designers and primary teachers to better enable children's games-based learning.
Vistribute: Distributing Interactive Visualizations in Dynamic Multi-Device Setups,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden Andreas Mathisen  Aarhus University Clemens Klokmose  Aarhus University Raimund Dachselt  Technische Universität Dresden Niklas Elmqvist  University of Maryland  College Park,We present Vistribute  a framework for the automatic distribution of visualizations and UI components across multiple heterogeneous devices. Our framework consists of three parts: (i) a design space considering properties and relationships of interactive visualizations  devices  and user preferences in multi-display environments; (ii) specific heuristics incorporating these dimensions for guiding the distribution for a given interface and device ensemble; and (iii) a web-based implementation instantiating these heuristics to automatically generate a distribution as well as providing interaction mechanisms for user-defined adaptations. In contrast to existing UI distribution systems  we are able to infer all required information by analyzing the visualizations and devices without relying on additional input provided by users or programmers. In a qualitative study  we let experts create their own distributions and rate both other manual distributions and our automatic ones. We found that all distributions provided comparable quality  hence validating our framework.
ActiveInk: (Th)Inking with Data,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Hugo Romat  Microsoft Research Nathalie Henry Riche  Microsoft Research Ken Hinckley  Microsoft Research Bongshin Lee  Microsoft Research Caroline Appert  Université Paris-Sud  CNRS  Université Paris-Saclay. Emmanuel Pietriga  INRIA  Université Paris-Saclay Christopher Collins  Microsoft Research,During sensemaking  people annotate insights: underlining sentences in a document or circling regions on a map. They jot down their hypotheses: drawing correlation lines on scatterplots or creating personal legends to track patterns. We present ActiveInk  a system enabling people to seamlessly transition between exploring data and externalizing their thoughts using pen and touch. ActiveInk enables the natural use of pen for active reading behaviors  while supporting analytic actions by activating any of these ink strokes. Through a qualitative study with eight participants  we contribute observations of active reading behaviors during data exploration and design principles to support sensemaking.
Dynamic Network Plaid: A Tool for the Analysis of Dynamic Networks,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Alexandra Lee  Swansea University Daniel Archambault  Swansea University Miguel A. Nacenta  University of St Andrews,Network data that changes over time can be very useful for studying a wide range of important phenomena  from how social network connections change to epidemiology. However  it is challenging to analyze  especially if it has many actors  connections or if the covered timespan is large with rapidly changing links (e.g.  months of changes with changes at second resolution). In these analyses one would often like to compare many periods of time to others  without having to look at the full timeline. To support this kind of analysis we designed and implemented a technique and system to visualize this dynamic data. The Dynamic Network Plaid (DNP) is designed for large displays and based on user-generated interactive timeslicing on the dynamic graph attributes and on linked provenance-preserving representations. We present the technique  interface and the design/evaluation with a group of public health researchers investigating non-suicidal self-harm picture sharing in Instagram.
Evaluating Pan and Zoom Timelines and Sliders,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Michail Schwab  Northeastern University Sicheng Hao  Northeastern University Olga Vitek  Northeastern University James Tompkin  Brown University Jeff Huang  Brown University Michelle A. Borkin  Northeastern University,Pan and zoom timelines and sliders help us navigate large time series data. However  designing efficient interactions can be difficult. We study pan and zoom methods via crowd-sourced experiments on mobile and computer devices  asking which designs and interactions provide faster target acquisition. We find that visual context should be limited for low-distance navigation  but added for far-distance navigation; that timelines should be oriented along the longer axis  especially on mobile; and that  as compared to default techniques  double click  hold  and rub zoom appear to scale worse with task difficulty  whereas brush and especially ortho zoom seem to scale better. Software and data used in this research are available as open source.
Adding Proprioceptive Feedback to Virtual Reality Experiences Using Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Misha Sra  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Abhinandan Jain  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Pattie Maes  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,We present a small and lightweight wearable device that enhances virtual reality experiences and reduces cybersickness by means of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). GVS is a specific way to elicit vestibular reflexes that has been used for over a century to study the function of the vestibular system. In addition to GVS  we support physiological sensing by connecting heart rate  electrodermal activity and other sensors to our wearable device using a plug and play mechanism. An accompanying Android app communicates with the device over Bluetooth (BLE) for transmitting the GVS stimulus to the user through electrodes attached behind the ears. Our system supports multiple categories of virtual reality applications with different types of virtual motion such as driving  navigating by flying  teleporting  or riding. We present a user study in which participants (N = 20) experienced significantly lower cybersickness when using our device and rated experiences with GVS-induced haptic feedback as significantly more immersive than a no-GVS baseline.
Assessing the Accuracy of Point & Teleport Locomotion with Orientation Indication for Virtual Reality using Curved Trajectories,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Markus Funk  TU Darmstadt Florian Müller  TU Darmstadt Marco Fendrich  TU Darmstadt Megan Shene  TU Darmstadt Moritz Kolvenbach  TU Darmstadt Niclas Dobbertin  TU Darmstadt Sebastian Günther  TU Darmstadt Max Mühlhäuser  TU Darmstadt,Room-scale Virtual Reality (VR) systems have arrived in users' homes where tracked environments are set up in limited physical spaces. As most Virtual Environments (VEs) are larger than the tracked physical space  locomotion techniques are used to navigate in VEs. Currently  in recent VR games  point & teleport is the most popular locomotion technique. However  it only allows users to select the position of the teleportation and not the orientation that the user is facing after the teleport. This results in users having to manually correct their orientation after teleporting and possibly getting entangled by the cable of the headset. In this paper  we introduce and evaluate three different point & teleport techniques that enable users to specify the target orientation while teleporting. The results show that  although the three teleportation techniques with orientation indication increase the average teleportation time  they lead to a decreased need for correcting the orientation after teleportation.
Exploring Interaction Fidelity in Virtual Reality: Object Manipulation and Whole-Body Movements,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Katja Rogers  Ulm University Jana Funke  Ulm University Julian Frommel  Ulm University Sven Stamm  Ulm University Michael Weber  Ulm University,High degrees of interaction fidelity (IF) in virtual reality (VR) are said to improve user experience and immersion  but there is also evidence of low IF providing comparable experiences. VR games are now increasingly prevalent  yet we still do not fully understand the trade-off between realism and abstraction in this context. We conducted a lab study comparing high and low IF for object manipulation tasks in a VR game. In a second study  we investigated players' experiences of IF for whole-body movements in a VR game that allowed players to crawl underneath virtual boulders and "dangle'' along monkey bars. Our findings show that high IF is preferred for object manipulation  but for whole-body movements  moderate IF can suffice  as there is a trade-off with usability and social factors. We provide guidelines for the development of VR games based on our results.
Brick: Toward A Model for Designing Synchronous Colocated Augmented Reality Games,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Po Bhattacharyya  Carnegie Mellon University Radha Nath  Carnegie Mellon University Yein Jo  Entertainment technology center Ketki Jadhav  Carnegie Mellon University Jessica Hammer  Carnegie Mellon University,Augmented reality (AR) games have been growing in popularity in recent years. However  current AR games offer limited opportunities for a synchronous multiplayer experience. This paper introduces a model for designing AR experiences in which players inhabit a shared  real-time augmented environment and can engage in synchronous and collaborative interactions with other players. We explored the development of this model through the creation of Brick  a two-player mobile AR game at the room scale. We refined Brick over multiple rounds of iteration  and we used our playtests to investigate a range of issues involved in designing shared-world AR games. Our findings suggest that there are five major categories of interactions in a shared-world AR system: single-player  intrapersonal  multiplayer  interpersonal  and environmental. We believe that this model can support the development of collaborative AR games and new forms of social gameplay.
SIG: Spatiality of Augmented Reality User Interfaces,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Island A CROWNE,Alla Vovk  Oxford Brookes University Danilo Gasques  University of California  San Diego Fridolin Wild  Oxford Brookes University Nadir Weibel  University of California  San Diego,Augmented reality and spatial information manipulation is being increasingly used as part of environ- ment integrated form factors and wearable device such as head-mounted displays. The integration of this exciting technology in many aspects of peoples' lives is transforming the way we understand computing  pushing the boundaries of Spatial Interfaces into virtual but embedded environments. We think that the time is ripe for a renewed discussion about the role of Augmented Reality within Spatial Interfaces. With this SIG we want to expand the discussion related to Spatial Interfaces and the way they impact interaction with the world in two areas. First  we aim to critically discuss the definition of Spatial Interfaces and outline the common components that build such interfaces in today's world. Second  we would like the community to reflect on the path ahead and focus on the potential of what kind of experiences can Spatial Interfaces achieve today
Augmented Reality Views for Occluded Interaction,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Lomond,Klemen Lilija  University of Copenhagen Henning Pohl  University of Copenhagen Sebastian Boring  University of Copenhagen Kasper Hornbæk  University of Copenhagen,We rely on our sight when manipulating objects. When objects are occluded  manipulation becomes difficult. Such occluded objects can be shown via augmented reality to re-enable visual guidance. However  it is unclear how to do so to best support object manipulation. We compare four views of occluded objects and their effect on performance and satisfaction across a set of everyday manipulation tasks of varying complexity. The best performing views were a see-through view and a displaced 3D view. The former enabled participants to observe the manipulated object through the occluder  while the latter showed the 3D view of the manipulated object offset from the object's real location. The worst performing view showed remote imagery from a simulated hand-mounted camera. Our results suggest that alignment of virtual objects with their real-world location is less important than an appropriate point-of-view and view stability.
A Design Space for Gaze Interaction on Head-mounted Displays,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Lomond,Teresa Hirzle  Ulm University Jan Gugenheimer  Ulm University Florian Geiselhart  Ulm University Andreas Bulling  University of Stuttgart Enrico Rukzio  University of Ulm,Augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) has entered the mass market and  with it  will soon eye tracking as a core technology for next generation head-mounted displays (HMDs). In contrast to existing gaze interfaces  the 3D nature of AR and VR requires estimating a user's gaze in 3D. While first applications  such as foveated rendering  hint at the compelling potential of combining HMDs and gaze  a systematic analysis is missing. To fill this gap  we present the first design space for gaze interaction on HMDs. Our design space covers human depth perception and technical requirements in two dimensions aiming to identify challenges and opportunities for interaction design. As such  our design space provides a comprehensive overview and serves as an important guideline for researchers and practitioners working on gaze interaction on HMDs. We further demonstrate how our design space is used in practice by presenting two interactive applications: EyeHealth and XRay-Vision.
Personalising the TV Experience using Augmented Reality: An Exploratory Study on Delivering Synchronised Sign Language Interpretation,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Lomond,Vinoba Vinayagamoorthy  BBC R&D Maxine Glancy  BBC R&D Christoph Ziegler  IRT Richard Schäffer  IRT,Augmented Reality (AR) technology has the potential to extend the screen area beyond the rigid frames of televisions. The additional display area can be used to augment televisions (TVs) with extra information tailored to individuals  for instance  the provision of access services like sign language interpretations. We invited 23 (11 in the UK  12 in Germany) users of signed content to evaluate three methods of watching a sign language interpreted programme – one traditional in-vision method with signed programme content on TV and two AR-enabled methods in which an AR sign language interpreter (a 'half-body' version and a 'full-body' version) is projected just outside the frame of the TV presenting the programme. In the UK  participants were split 3-ways in their preferences while in Germany  half the participants preferred the traditional method followed closely by the 'half-body' version. We discuss our participants reasoning behind their preferences and implications for future research.
Egocentric Smaller-person Experience through a Change in Visual Perspective,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 14:00:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 15:20,Lomond,Jun Nishida  JSPS & University of Chicago Soichiro Matsuda  University of Tsukuba Mika Oki  University of Tsukuba Hikaru Takatori  University of Tsukuba Kosuke Sato  University of Tsukuba Kenji Suzuki  University of Tsukuba & JST,This paper explores how human perceptions  actions  and interactions can be changed through an embodied and active experience of being a smaller person in a real-world environment  which we call an egocentric smaller person experience. We developed a wearable visual translator that provides the perspective of a smaller person by shifting the wearer's eyesight level down to their waist using a head-mounted display and a stereo camera module  while allowing for field of view control through head movements. In this study  we investigated how the developed device can modify the wearer's body representation and experiences based on a field study conducted at a nursing school and museums  and through lab studies. It was observed that the participants changed their perceptions  actions  and interactions because they are considered to have perceived themselves as being smaller. Using this device  designers and teachers can understand the perspectives of other people in an existing environment.

LBW0111: Scratch Nodes ML: A Playful System for Children to Create Gesture Recognition Classifiers,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 15:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Adam Agassi  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Hadas Erel  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Iddo Yehoshua Wald  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Oren Zuckerman  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC),Children are growing up in a Machine Learning infused world and it's imperative to provide them with opportunities to develop an accurate understanding of basic Machine Learning concepts. Physical gesture recognition is a typical application of Machine Learning  and physical gestures are also an integral part of children's lives  including sports and play. We present Scratch Nodes ML  a system enabling children to create personalized gesture recognizers by: (1) Creating their own gesture classes; (2) Collecting gesture data for each class; (3) Evaluating the classifier they created with new gesture data; (4) Integrating their classifiers into the Scratch environment as new Scratch blocks  empowering other children to use these new blocks as gesture classifiers in their own Scratch creations.
LBW0112: Cross-country User Connections in an Online Social Network for Music,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 15:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Christine Bauer  Johannes Kepler University Linz Markus Schedl  Johannes Kepler University Linz,Social connections and cultural aspects play important roles in shaping an individual's preferences. For instance  people tend to select friends with similar music preferences. Furthermore  preferences and friending are influenced by cultural aspects. Recommender systems may benefit from these phenomena by using knowledge about the nature of social ties to better tailor recommendations to an individual. Focusing on the specifities of music preferences  we study user connections on Last.fm---an online social network for music. We identify those countries whose users are mainly connected within the same country  and those countries that are characterized by cross-country user connections. Strong cross-country connection pairs are typically characterized by similar cultural  historic  or linguistic backgrounds  or geographic proximity. The United States  the United Kingdom  and Russia are identified as countries having a large relative amount of user connections from other countries. Our results contribute to understanding the complexity of social ties and how they are reflected in connection behavior  and are a promising source for advancements of personalized systems.
LBW0113: Character Alive: A Tangible Reading and Writing System for Chinese Children At-risk for Dyslexia,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 15:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Min Fan  Simon Fraser University Jianyu Fan  Simon Fraser University Alissa N. Antle  Simon Fraser University Sheng Jin  Communication University of Zhejiang Dongxu Yin  Communication University of Zhejiang Philippe Pasquier  Simon Fraser University,This paper presents Character Alive  a tangible system designed to improve early Chinese literacy acquisition for Mandarin-speaking children at-risk for dyslexia by enabling high-level interaction. Character Alive uses the multisensory training method to teach children the reading and writing of Chinese characters and words. The core design features of our system are augmented dynamic color cues  2D radical cards and handwriting cards with tactile cues  and multimedia content such as character animations. Character Alive was built on our previous work on designing tangible and augmented reality reading and writing systems for children at-risk for dyslexia in English. Our previous work has demonstrated that dynamic color cues can draw children's attention to key characteristics of letter-sound-correspondences and two-hand actions with tangible letters help children to better solve spelling tasks. We present the design rationale  the design and implementation of the Character Alive system  and the future plan on evaluating the system.
LBW0114: LookUnlock: Using Spatial-Targets for User-Authentication on HMDs,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 15:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Markus Funk  Siemens CT & Technische Universität Darmstadt Karola Marky  Technische Universität Darmstadt Iori Mizutani  Siemens CT & University of St. Gallen Mareike Kritzler  Siemens CT Simon Mayer  Siemens CT & University of St. Gallen Florian Michahelles  Siemens CT,With head-mounted displays (HMDs)  users can access and interact with a broad range of applications and data. Although some of this information is privacy-sensitive or even confidential  no intuitive  unobtrusive and secure authentication technique is available yet for HMDs. We present LookUnlock  an authentication technique for HMDs that uses passwords that are composed of spatial and virtual targets. Through a proof-of-concept implementation and security evaluation  we demonstrate that this technique can be efficiently used by people and is resistant to shoulder-surfing attacks.
LBW0115: Weaving the Topics of CHI: Using Citation Network Analysis to Explore Emerging Trends,Tuesday  May 07  2019 - 15:20:00,Tuesday  May 07  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Clement Lee  Newcastle University Andrew Garbett  Newcastle University Junyan Wang  Newcastle University Bingzhang Hu  Newcastle University Dan Jackson  Newcastle University,This paper provides a comprehensive and novel analysis of the annual conference proceedings of CHI to explore the structure and evolution of the community. Self-awareness is healthy for a diverse and dynamic community  allowing it to anticipate and respond to emerging themes. Instead of using a traditional topic modelling approach to analyze the text of the papers  we adopt a social network analysis approach by analyzing the citation network of papers. After constructing such a citation network  community detection is applied in order to cluster papers into different groups. The keywords of these groups are found to represent different research themes in human-computer interaction  while the growth or decline of these groups is visualized by their paper shares over time. Lastly  we contribute a visualization tool for exploring emerging trends within our community  which can be used to predict likely topics at future CHI conferences.

It integrates intents  cues  persuasive principles and design options for automotive persuasion. Our results show that most systems target safety and eco-driving using conscious cues to alert the driver. Most systems use self-monitoring  tailoring or suggestion as persuasive principles. Visual modalities are still much more popular than auditory or haptic ones. We identified blind spots to support designers and researchers in developing systems addressing areas which are less explored in automotive persuasion.

Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.

Starner  Georgia Institute of Technology Gregory D. Abowd  Georgia Institute of Technology,We introduce Serpentine  a self-powered sensor that is a reversibly deformable cord capable of sensing a variety of human input. The material properties and structural design of Serpentine allow it to be flexible  twistable  stretchable and squeezable  enabling a broad variety of expressive input modalities. The sensor operates using the principle of Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENG)  which allows it to sense mechanical deformation without an external power source. The affordances of the cord include six interactions---Pluck  Twirl  Stretch  Pinch  Wiggle and Twist. Serpentine demonstrates the ability to simultaneously recognize these inputs through a single physical interface. A 12-participant user study illustrates 95.7% accuracy for a user-dependent recognition model using a realtime system and 92.17% for user-independent offline detection. We conclude by demonstrating how Serpentine can be employed in everyday ubiquitous computing applications.
EnhancedTouchX: Smart Bracelets for Augmenting Interpersonal Touch Interactions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Taku Hachisu  University of Tsukuba Baptiste Bourreau  University of Tsukuba Kenji Suzuki  University of Tsukuba,EnhancedTouchX  a bracelet-type interpersonal body area network device  not only detects but also quantifies interpersonal hand-to-hand touch interactions. Without any wired connection  it can identify the direction and gestures of a touch. The developed device can connect to an external device via Bluetooth Low Energy for monitoring and logging where  when  how long  who  and how the touch interactions occurred. These daily augmented touch interactions provided by such contextual information would offer a variety of applications to facilitate social interactions. Our experiment  conducted with several pairs of participants  demonstrates that the devices can identify the direction of a touch (from one initiating the touch (active touch) to the one being touched (passive touch)) with 95% accuracy. In addition  the devices are also capable of identifying four types of touch gestures with 85% accuracy using a simple threshold classifier.
ThermalBracelet: Exploring Thermal Haptic Feedback Around the Wrist,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Roshan Lalitha Peiris  Keio University Graduate School of Media Design Yuan-Ling Feng  Keio University Graduate School of Media Design Liwei Chan  National Chiao Tung University Kouta Minamizawa  Keio University Graduate School of Media Design,Smartwatches enable the wrist to be used as an ideal location to provide always-available haptic notifications as they are constantly worn with direct contact with the skin. With the wrist straps  the haptic feedback can be extended to the full space around the wrist to provide more spatial and enriched feedback. With ThermalBracelet  we investigate thermal feedback as a haptic feedback modality around the wrist. We present three studies that lead to the development of a smartwatch-integratable thermal bracelet that stimulates six locations around the wrist. Our initial evaluation reports on the selection of the thermal module configurations. Secondly  with the selected six-module configuration  we explore its usability in a real-world scenarios such as walking and reading. Thirdly  we investigate its capability of providing spatio temporal feedback while engaged in distracting tasks. Finally we present application scenarios that demonstrates its usability.
EarTouch: Facilitating Smartphone Use for Visually Impaired People in Mobile and Public Scenarios,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Ruolin Wang  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Chun Yu  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Xing-Dong Yang  Dartmouth College Weijie He  Tsinghua University Yuanchun Shi  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education,Interacting with a smartphone using touch input and speech output is challenging for visually impaired people in mobile and public scenarios  where only one hand may be available for input (e.g.  while holding a cane) and using the loudspeaker for speech output is constrained by environmental noise  privacy  and social concerns. To address these issues  we propose EarTouch  a one-handed interaction technique that allows the users to interact with a smartphone using the ear to perform gestures on the touchscreen. Users hold the phone to their ears and listen to speech output from the ear speaker privately. We report how the technique was designed  implemented  and evaluated through a series of studies. Results show that EarTouch is easy  efficient  fun and socially acceptable to use.
'I make up a silly name': Understanding Children's Perception of Privacy Risks Online,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Jun Zhao  University of Oxford Ge Wang  University College London Carys Dally  University of Oxford Petr Slovak  King's College London Julian Edbrooke-Childs  Anna Freud Centre Max Van Kleek  University of Oxford Nigel Shadbolt  University of Oxford,Children under 11 are often regarded as too young to comprehend the implications of online privacy. Perhaps as a result  little research has focused on younger kids' risk recognition and coping. Such knowledge is  however  critical for designing efficient safeguarding mechanisms for this age group. Through 12 focus group studies with 29 children aged 6-10 from UK schools  we examined how children described privacy risks related to their use of tablet computers and what information was used by them to identify threats. We found that children could identify and articulate certain privacy risks well  such as information oversharing or revealing real identities online; however  they had less awareness with respect to other risks  such as online tracking or game promotions. Our findings offer promising directions for supporting children's awareness of cyber risks and the ability to protect themselves online.
Risk vs. Restriction: The Tension between Providing a Sense of Normalcy and Keeping Foster Teens Safe Online,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Karla Badillo-Urquiola  University of Central Florida Xinru Page  Bentley University Pamela J. Wisniewski  University of Central Florida,Foster youth are particularly vulnerable to offline risks; yet  little is known about their online risk experiences or how foster parents mediate technology use in the home. We conducted 29 interviews with foster parents of 42 teens (ages 13-17) who were part of the child welfare system. Foster parents faced significant challenges relating to technology mediation in the home. Based on parental accounts  over half of the foster teens encountered high-risk situations that involved interacting with unsafe people online  resulting in rape  sex trafficking  and/or psychological harm. Overall  foster parents were at a loss for how to balance online safety with technology access in a way that engendered positive relationships with their foster teens. Instead  parents often resorted to outright restriction. Our research highlights the importance of considering the unique needs of foster families and designing technologies to address the challenges faced by this vulnerable population of teens and parents.
Laughing is Scary  but Farting is Cute: A Conceptual Model of Children's Perspectives of Creepy Technologies,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Jason C.

However  less is known about what children themselves find concerning in everyday technologies. We examine children's technology-related fears by probing their use of the colloquial term "creepy." To understand children's perceptions of "creepy technologies " we conducted four participatory design sessions with children (ages 7 - 11) to design and evaluate creepy technologies  followed by interviews with the same children. We found that children's fear reactions emphasized physical harm and threats to their relationships (particularly with attachment figures). The creepy signals from technology the children described include: deception  lack of control  mimicry  ominous physical appearance  and unpredictability. Children acknowledged trusted adults will mediate the relationship between creepy technology signals and fear responses. Our work contributes a close examination of what children mean when they say a technology is "creepy." By treating these concerns as principal design considerations  developers can build systems that are more transparent about the risks they produce and more sensitive to the fears they may unintentionally raise.
It's My Data! Tensions Among Stakeholders of a Learning Analytics Dashboard,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Kaiwen Sun  University of Michigan Abraham H.

To understand perceptions regarding the ethics and impact of such learning analytics applications  we conducted a multi-stakeholder analysis of an early-warning dashboard deployed at the University of Michigan through semi-structured interviews with the system's developers  academic advisors (the primary users)  and students. We identify multiple tensions among and within the stakeholder groups  especially with regard to awareness  understanding  access and use of the system. Furthermore  ambiguity in data provenance and data quality result in differing levels of reliance and concerns about the system among academic advisors and students. While students see the system's benefits  they argue for more involvement  control  and informed consent regarding the use of student data. We discuss our findings' implications for the ethical design and deployment of learning analytics applications in higher education.

From the Lab to the OB Truck: Object-Based Broadcasting at the FA Cup in Wembley Stadium,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Thomas Röggla  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica Jie Li  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica Stefan Fjellsten  ChyronHego AB Jack Jansen  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica Ian Kegel  BT Applied Research Luke Pilgrim  BT Applied Research Martin Trimby  BT Applied Research Doug Williams  BT Applied Research Pablo Cesar  Delft University of Technology and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica,While traditional live-broadcasting is typically comprised of a handful of well-defined workflows  these become insufficient when targeting multiple screens and interactive companion devices on the viewer side. In this case study  we describe the development of an end-to-end system enabling immersive and interactive experiences using an object-based broadcasting approach. We detail the deployment of this system during the live broadcast of the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium in London in May 2018. We also describe the trials and interviews we ran in the run-up to this event  the infrastructure we used  the final software developed for controlling and rendering on-screen graphics and the system for generating and configuring the live broadcast-objects. In this process  we learned about the workflows inside an OB truck during live productions through an ethnographic study and the challenges involved in running an object-based broadcast over the Internet  which we discuss alongside other gained insights.

We enrolled 757 information workers across the U.S. and measure heart rate  physical activity  sleep  social context  and other aspects through smartwatches  a phone agent  beacons  and social media. We report challenges that we faced with enrollment  privacy  and incentive structures while setting up such a long-term multimodal large-scale sensor study. We discuss the tradeoffs of remote versus in-person enrollment  and showed that directly paid  in-person enrolled participants are more compliant overall compared to remotely-enrolled participants. We find that providing detailed information regarding privacy concerns up-front is highly beneficial. We believe that our experiences can benefit other large sensor projects as this field grows.
Building Together: When Research Went Viral at Uber,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Bjorn Hubert-Wallander  Uber Technologies  Inc. Eduardo Gomez Ruiz  Uber Technologies Minal Jain  Uber Technologies Laura Garcia Barrio  Uber Do Brasil Tecnologia LTDA Saswati Saha Mitra  Uber London Limited Molly Stevens  Uber Technologies,In late 2017  Uber was nearly a year into a complete redesign of its driver-facing mobile app. This case study describes the research program we executed to support the app's global beta launch  which aimed to "Build Together" with drivers across different geographies. With the goal of minimizing the time-space-cognitive distance between beta drivers and the product team  we deployed researchers in 7 cities for a 3-week research sprint  combining four high-touch ethnographic methods to understand drivers' reaction to the product. Unusually  we used an internal Google+ social media site to post a continual stream of raw  unsynthesized "atomic evidence" from research activities. The G+ unexpectedly went viral  creating extremely high engagement  impact  and stakeholder sentiment. Here we discuss the pros  cons  and impact of our approach  and also how success came from creating space for others to create  engage with  and act on raw evidence from the field.
Computational Interaction with Bayesian Methods,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge Nikola Banovic  University of Michigan Antti Oulasvirta  Aalto University John Williamson  University of Glasgow,This course introduces computational methods in human--computer interaction. Computational interaction methods use computational thinking---abstraction  automation  and analysis---to explain and enhance interaction. This course introduces the theory of practice of computational interaction by teaching Bayesian methods for interaction across four wide areas of interest when designing computationally-driven user interfaces: decoding  adaptation  learning and optimization. The lectures center on hands-on Python programming interleaved with theory and practical examples grounded in problems of wide interest in human-computer interaction.
Designing with the Mind in Mind: The Psychological Basis for UI Design Guidelines,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Argyll 3 CROWNE,Jeff A.

By understanding the underlying psychology  designers and evaluators enhance their ability to apply design rules. This two-part (160-minute) course explains that psychology.
Tool Extension in Human–Computer Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Boisdale 1,Joanna Bergström  University of Copenhagen Aske Mottelson  University of Copenhagen Andreea Muresan  University of Copenhagen Kasper Hornbæk  University of Copenhagen,Tool use extends people's representations of the immediately actionable space around them. Physical tools thereby become integrated in people's body schemas. We introduce a measure for tool extension in HCI by using a visual-tactile interference paradigm. In this paradigm  an index of tool extension is given by response time differences between crossmodally congruent and incongruent stimuli; tactile on the hand and visual on the tool. We use this measure to examine if and how findings on tool extension apply to interaction with computer-based tools. Our first experiment shows that touchpad and mouse both provide tool extension over a baseline condition without a tool. A second experiment shows a higher degree of tool extension for a realistic avatar hand compared to an abstract pointer for interaction in virtual reality. In sum  our measure can detect tool extension with computer-based tools and differentiate interfaces by their degree of extension.
Ways of Knowing When Research Subjects Care,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Boisdale 1,Dorothy Howard  University of California  San Diego Lilly Irani  University of California  San Diego,This paper investigates a hidden dimension of research with real world stakes: research subjects who care -- sometimes deeply -- about the topic of the research in which they participate. They manifest this care  we show  by managing how they are represented in the research process  by exercising politics in shaping knowledge production  and sometimes in experiencing trauma in the process. We draw first-hand reflections on participation in diversity research on Wikipedia  transforming participants from objects of study to active negotiators of research process. We depict how care  vulnerability  harm  and emotions shape ethnographic and qualitative data. We argue that  especially in reflexive cultures  research subjects are active agents with agendas  accountabilities  and political projects of their own. We propose ethics of care and collaboration to open up new possibilities for knowledge production and socio-technical intervention in HCI.
Explicating "Implicit Interaction": An Examination of the Concept and Challenges for Research,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Boisdale 1,Barış Serim  University of Helsinki & Aalto University Giulio Jacucci  University of Helsinki,The term implicit interaction is often used to denote interactions that differ from traditional purposeful and attention demanding ways of interacting with computers. However  there is a lack of agreement about the term's precise meaning. This paper develops implicit interaction further as an analytic concept and identifies the methodological challenges related to HCI's particular design orientation. We first review meanings of implicit as unintentional  attentional background  unawareness  unconsciousness and implicature  and compare them in regards to the entity they qualify  the design motivation they emphasize and their constructive validity for what makes good interaction. We then demonstrate how the methodological challenges can be addressed with greater precision by using an updated  intentionality-based definition that specifies an input–effect relationship as the entity of implicit. We conclude by identifying a number of new considerations for design and evaluation  and by reflecting on the concepts of user and system agency in HCI.
Personas and Identity: Looking at Multiple Identities to Inform the Construction of Personas,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Boisdale 1,Nicola Marsden  Heilbronn University Monika Pröbster  Heilbronn University,Personas are valuable tools to help designers get to know their users and adopt their perspectives. Yet people are complex and multiple identities have to be considered in their interplay to account for a comprehensive representation – otherwise  personas might be superficial and prone to activate stereotypes. Therefore  the way users' identities are presented in a limited set of personas is crucial to account for diversity and highlight facets which otherwise would go unnoticed. In this paper  we introduce an approach to the development of personas informed by social identity theory. The effectiveness of this approach is investigated in a qualitative study in the context of the design process for an e-learning platform for women in tech. The results suggest that considering multiple identities in the construction of personas adds value when designing technologies.
How Data Science Workers Work with Data: Discovery  Capture  Curation  Design  Creation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Michael Muller  IBM Research Ingrid Lange  IBM Research Dakuo Wang  IBM Research David Piorkowski  IBM Research Jason Tsay  IBM Research Q. Vera Liao  IBM Research Casey Dugan  IBM Research Thomas Erickson  Unaffiliated,With the rise of big data  there has been an increasing need for practitioners in this space and an increasing opportunity for researchers to understand their workflows and design new tools to improve it. Data science is often described as data-driven  comprising unambiguous data and proceeding through regularized steps of analysis. However  this view focuses more on abstract processes  pipelines  and workflows  and less on how data science workers engage with the data. In this paper  we build on the work of other CSCW and HCI researchers in describing the ways that scientists  scholars  engineers  and others work with their data  through analyses of interviews with 21 data science professionals. We set five approaches to data along a dimension of interventions: Data as given; as captured; as curated; as designed; and as created. Data science workers develop an intuitive sense of their data and processes  and actively shape their data. We propose new ways to apply these interventions analytically  to make sense of the complex activities around data practices.
Designing for Reproducibility: A Qualitative Study of Challenges and Opportunities in High Energy Physics,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Sebastian S. Feger  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich & CERN Sünje Dallmeier-Tiessen  CERN Albrecht Schmidt  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Paweł W. Woźniak  Utrecht University,Reproducibility should be a cornerstone of scientific research and is a growing concern among the scientific community and the public. Understanding how to design services and tools that support documentation  preservation and sharing is required to maximize the positive impact of scientific research. We conducted a study of user attitudes towards systems that support data preservation in High Energy Physics  one of science's most data-intensive branches. We report on our interview study with 12 experimental physicists  studying requirements and opportunities in designing for research preservation and reproducibility. Our findings suggest that we need to design for motivation and benefits in order to stimulate contributions and to address the observed scalability challenge. Therefore  researchers' attitudes towards communication  uncertainty  collaboration and automation need to be reflected in design. Based on our findings  we present a systematic view of user needs and constraints that define the design space of systems supporting reproducible practices.
An Exploratory Study on Visual Exploration of Model Simulations by Multiple Types of Experts,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Nadia Boukhelifa  UMR GMPA  AgroParisTech  INRA  Univ.

Paris-Saclay Nathalie Méjean Perrot  UMR GMPA  AgroParisTech  INRA  Univ. Paris-Saclay Evelyne Lutton  UMR GMPA  AgroParisTech  INRA  Univ. Paris-Saclay,Experts in different domains rely increasingly on simulation models of complex processes to reach insights  make decisions  and plan future projects. These models are often used to study possible trade-offs  as experts try to optimise multiple conflicting objectives in a single investigation. Understanding all the model intricacies  however  is challenging for a single domain expert. We propose a simple approach to support multiple experts when exploring complex model results. First  we reduce the model exploration space  then present the results on a shared interactive surface  in the form of a scatterplot matrix and linked views. To explore how multiple experts analyse trade-offs using this setup  we carried out an observational study focusing on the link between expertise and insight generation during the analysis process. Our results reveal the different exploration strategies and multi-storyline approaches that domain experts adopt during trade-off analysis  and inform our recommendations for collaborative model exploration systems.
Visualizing Uncertainty and Alternatives in Event Sequence Predictions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Shunan Guo  East China Normal University Fan Du  Adobe Research Sana Malik  Adobe Research Eunyee Koh  Adobe Research Sungchul Kim  Adobe Research Zhicheng Liu  Adobe Research Donghyun Kim  Adobe Research Hongyuan Zha  East China Normal University Nan Cao  Tongji University,Data analysts apply machine learning and statistical methods to timestamped event sequences to tackle various problems but face unique challenges when interpreting the results. Especially in event sequence prediction  it is difficult to convey uncertainty and possible alternative paths or outcomes. In this work  informed by interviews with five machine learning practitioners  we iteratively designed a novel visualization for exploring event sequence predictions of multiple records where users are able to review the most probable predictions and possible alternatives alongside uncertainty information. Through a controlled study with 18 participants  we found that users are more confident in making decisions when alternative predictions are displayed and they consider the alternatives more when deciding between two options with similar top predictions.
Engaging Low-Income African American Older Adults in Health Discussions through Community-based Design Workshops,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Christina N. Harrington  Northwestern University Katya Borgos-Rodriguez  Northwestern University Anne Marie Piper  Northwestern University,Community-based approaches to participatory design  such as the design workshop  promise to engage underserved populations in collaborative dialog and provide a platform for promoting the views of communities who are not typically given a space to engage in design. Yet  we know little about how design workshops as a research site can engage underserved individuals (i.e.  due to class  race  or age status) or address personal concerns (e.g.  health). As a way of exploring these issues  we conducted a series of five design workshops with low-income African-American older adults to understand their health experiences. Our findings reveal three insights associated with the design workshop and the topic of health: comfort with community versus personal health; the sociocultural configuration of interaction; and empowerment in the context of systematic inequality of opportunity. We discuss the importance of understanding the situated nature of design workshops  particularly when engaging underserved groups in the topic of health  and the potential of the design workshop as a mechanism for activism.
Co-Designing Food Trackers with Dietitians: Identifying Design Opportunities for Food Tracker Customization,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Yuhan Luo  University of Maryland  College Park Peiyi Liu  University of Maryland  College Park Eun Kyoung Choe  University of Maryland  College Park,We report co-design workshops with registered dietitians conducted to identify opportunities for designing customizable food trackers. Dietitians typically see patients who have different dietary problems  thus having different information needs. However  existing food trackers such as paper-based diaries and mobile apps are rarely customizable  making it difficult to capture necessary data for both patients and dietitians. During the co-design sessions  dietitians created representative patient personas and designed food trackers for each persona. We found a wide range of potential tracking items such as food  reflection  symptom  activity  and physical state. Depending on patients' dietary problems and dietitians' practice  the necessity and importance of these tracking items vary. We identify opportunities for patients and healthcare providers to collaborate around data tracking and sharing through customization. We also discuss how to structure co-design workshops to solicit the design considerations of self-tracking tools for patients with specific health problems.
Participatory Design of VR Scenarios for Exposure Therapy,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Eivind Flobak  University of Bergen Jo D. Wake  University of Bergen & NORCE Joakim Vindenes  University of Bergen Smiti Kahlon  Haukeland University Hospital Tine Nordgreen  Haukeland University Hospital & University of Bergen Frode Guribye  University of Bergen & Haukeland University Hospital,Virtual reality (VR) applications for exposure therapy predominantly use computer-generated imagery to create controlled environments in which users can be exposed to their fears. Creating 3D animations  however  is demanding and time-consuming. This paper presents a participatory approach for prototyping VR scenarios that are enabled by 360° video and grounded in lived experiences. We organized a participatory workshop with adolescents to prototype such scenarios  consisting of iterative phases of ideation  storyboarding  live-action plays recorded by a 360° camera  and group evaluation. Through an analysis of the participants' interactions  we outline how they worked to design prototypes that depict situations relevant to those with a fear of public speaking. Our analysis also explores how participants used their experiences and reflections as resources for design. Six clinical psychologists evaluated the prototypes from the workshop and concluded they were viable therapeutic tools  emphasizing the immersive  realistic experience they presented. We argue that our approach makes the design of VR scenarios more accessible.
Co-Created Personas: Engaging and Empowering Users with Diverse Needs Within the Design Process,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Timothy Neate  City  University of London Aikaterini Bourazeri  City  University of London Abi Roper  City  University of London Simone Stumpf  City  University of London Stephanie Wilson  City  University of London,Personas are powerful tools for designing technology and envisioning its usage. They are widely used to imagine archetypal users around whom to orient design work. We have been exploring co-created personas as a technique to use in co-design with users who have diverse needs. Our vision was that this would broaden the demographic and liberate co-designers of their personal relationship with a health condition. This paper reports three studies where we investigated using co-created personas with people who had Parkinson's disease  dementia or aphasia. Observational data of co-design sessions were collected and analysed. Findings revealed that the co-created personas encouraged users with diverse needs to engage with co-designing. Importantly  they also afforded additional benefits including empowering users within a more accessible design process. Reflecting on the outcomes from the different user groups  we conclude with a discussion of the potential for co-created personas to be applied more broadly.
Inaction as a Design Decision: Reflections on Not Designing Self-Tracking Tools for Menopause,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Carron 2,Sarah Homewood  IT University of Copenhagen,This reflective essay documents an attempt to design self-tracking technologies for menopause. This process culminated in the decision to not design. The contribution of this essay is the knowledge produced through reflecting on inaction. From an investigation into current examples  it became clear that applying self-tracking to menopause was fundamentally inappropriate. These technologies were also found to risk resulting in more harm than good; both in essentializing and medicalizing a non-medical process  and in perpetuating notions of the bodily experience of the menopausal transition as a negative experience.
Countermeasures: Learning to Lie to Objects,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Carron 2,Angus Main  Royal College of Art,Ubiquitous computing is leading to ubiquitous sensing. Sensor components such as motion  proximity  and biometric sensors are increasingly common features in everyday objects. However  the presence and full capabilities of these components are often not clear to users. Sensor-enhanced objects have the ability to perceive without being perceived. This reduces the ability of users to control how and when they are being sensed. To address this imbalance  this project identifies the need to be able to deceive 'smart' objects  and proposes a number of practical interventions to increase user awareness of sensors  and encourage agency over digital sensing through acts of dishonesty to objects.
Patching Gender: Non-binary Utopias in HCI,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Carron 2,Katta Spiel  TU Wien Os Keyes  University of Washington Pınar Barlas  Smart Systems and Emerging Technologies,Non-binary people are rarely considered by technologies or technologists  and often subsumed under binary trans experiences on the rare occasions when we are discussed. In this paper we share our own experiences and explore potential alternatives - utopias  impossible places  as our lived experience of technologies' obsessive gender binarism seems near-insurmountable. Our suggestions on how to patch these gender bugs appear trivial while at the same time revealing seemingly insurmountable barriers. We illustrate the casual violence technologies present to non-binary people  as well as the on-going marginalisations we experience as HCI researchers. We write this paper primarily as an expression of self-empowerment that can function as a first step towards raising awareness towards the complexities at stake.
Digital Silence and Liberating Stories: During a Student-Driven Movement,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Carron 2,Nova Ahmed  North South University Zareen Tasnim  North South University.Bangladesh Jasmine Jones  University of Michigan,In August 2018  a student protest initiated in Bangladesh sought justice when two school students were run over by public bus. Student protesters were demonstrating on the street for days until they were physically attacked. Concurrent with the physical attacks  the country experienced a disconnect. Internet  restrictions on social media usage  and several high-profile arrests of people speaking about the incidents. These suppressive encounters created what we call a "digital silence." In response  we collected stories from people  which depict their effort to seek out information about the events unfolding and share their perspective of what happened. Through these in-the-moment stories  we see a glimpse of how the information suppression impacted people with varying proximity to the events  including protesters  bystanders  and family members. We also reflect on the benefit of the subtle defiance of storytelling for storytellers in the midst of this social justice effort.
Avoiding and Mitigating Ethical Traps in Technocentric Fieldwork,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto Mississauga Roisin McNaney  Bristol University Jenny Waycott  The University of Melbourne,We are witnessing an increase in fieldwork within the field of HCI  particularly involving marginalized or under-represented populations. This has posed ethical challenges for researchers during such field studies  with "ethical traps" not always identified during planning stages. This is often aggravated by the inconsistent policy guidelines  training  and application of ethical principles. We ground this in our collective experiences with ethically-difficult research  and frame it within common principles that are common across many disciplines and policy guidelines – representative of the instructors' diverse and international backgrounds.
Building Economic Models of Human Computer Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Leif Azzopardi  University of Strathclyde Guido Zuccon  University of Queensland,Economics provides an intuitive and natural way to formally represent the cost and benefits of interacting with applications  interfaces and devices. By using economics models it is possible to reason about interaction and make predictions about how changes to the system will affect performance and behavior. In this course  we provided an overview of relevant economic concepts and then showed how economics can be used to model human computer interaction to generated hypotheses about interaction which can be used to inform design and guide experimentation. As a case study  we demonstrate how various interactions with search and recommender applications can be modeled  before concluding the day with a hands-on modeling session using example and participant problems.
Tangible Ecosystem Design – Developing Disruptive Services for Digital Ecosystems,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Claudia Nass Bauer  Fraunhofer IESE Marcus Trapp  Fraunhofer IESE,The epoch of the platform economy has arrived. Companies face the question of how to build up disruptive digital services with disruptive business models and establish a digital ecosystem. Traditional UCD methods concentrate on the conception of particular services. Nevertheless  most of these are isolated solutions of single companies. Building services for the digital transformation era requires additional methods to come up with end-to-end consumer experiences and sustainable business models across boundaries of single companies for benefiting consumers. In this course participants learn the "Tangible Ecosystem Design" Method (TED)  that supports the conception of Digital Ecosystems by using tangible elements.
Behind the Curtain of the "Ultimate Empathy Machine": On the Composition of Virtual Reality Nonfiction Experiences,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Chris Bevan  University of Bristol David Philip Green  University of the West of England Harry Farmer  University of Bath Mandy Rose  University of the West of England Kirsten Cater  University of Bristol Danaë Stanton Fraser  University of Bath Helen Brown  University of Bath,Virtual Reality nonfiction (VRNF) is an emerging form of immersive media experience created for consumption using panoramic "Virtual Reality" headsets. VRNF promises nonfiction content producers the potential to create new ways for audiences to experience "the real"; allowing viewers to transition from passive spectators to active participants. Our current project is exploring VRNF through a series of ethnographic and experimental studies. In order to document the content available  we embarked on an analysis of VR documentaries produced to date. In this paper  we present an analysis of a representative sample of 150 VRNF titles released between 2012-2018. We identify and quantify 64 characteristics of the medium over this period  discuss how producers are exploiting the affordances of VR  and shed light on new audience roles. Our findings provide insight into the current state of the art in VRNF and provide a digital resource for other researchers in this area.
Experimental Analysis of Barehand Mid-air Mode-Switching Techniques in Virtual Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Hemant Bhaskar Surale  University of Waterloo Fabrice Matulic  Preferred Networks Inc. Daniel Vogel  University of Waterloo,We present an empirical comparison of eleven bare hand  mid-air mode-switching techniques suitable for virtual reality in two experiments. The first evaluates seven techniques spanning dominant and non-dominant hand actions. Techniques represent common classes of actions selected by a methodical examination of 56 examples of prior art. The standard "subtraction method" protocol is adapted for 3D interfaces  with two baseline selection methods  bare hand pinch and device controller button. A second experiment with four techniques explores more subtle dominant-hand techniques and the effect of using a dominant hand device for selection. Results provide guidance to practitioners when choosing bare hand  mid-air mode-switching techniques  and for researchers when designing new mode-switching methods in VR.
What is Mixed Reality?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Maximilian Speicher  University of Michigan & C&A Europe Brian D. Hall  University of Michigan Michael Nebeling  University of Michigan,What is Mixed Reality (MR)? To revisit this question given the many recent developments  we conducted interviews with ten AR/VR experts from academia and industry  as well as a literature survey of 68 papers. We find that  while there are prominent examples  there is no universally agreed on  one-size-fits-all definition of MR. Rather  we identified six partially competing notions from the literature and experts' responses. We then started to isolate the different aspects of reality relevant for MR experiences  going beyond the primarily visual notions and extending to audio  motion  haptics  taste  and smell. We distill our findings into a conceptual framework with seven dimensions to characterize MR applications in terms of the number of environments  number of users  level of immersion  level of virtuality  degree of interaction  input  and output. Our goal with this paper is to support classification and discussion of MR applications' design and provide a better means to researchers to contextualize their work within the increasingly fragmented MR landscape.
Engaging Lived and Virtual Realities,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Aditya Vishwanath  Stanford University Naveena Karusala  University of Washington Marisol Wong-Villacres  Georgia Institute of Technology Neha Kumar  Georgia Institute of Technology,We examined the integration of VR into informal and less-structured learning environments in Atlanta (USA) and Mumbai (India) through a process of co-design  co-creation  and co-learning with students and teachers where students learned to use VR to engage with their economic  social  and cultural realities. Using qualitative methods  we engaged students and teachers at both sites in VR content creation activities; through these activities  we attempt to uncover a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities of introducing low-cost mobile VR for content generation  consumption  and sharing in underserved learning contexts. We also motivate future work that looks at integrating VR in new contexts  using flexible methods  across borders. The larger vision of our research is to advance us towards greater accessibility and inclusivity of VR across diverse learning environments.
I'm a Giant: Walking in Large Virtual Environments at High Speed Gains,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Parastoo Abtahi  Stanford University Mar Gonzalez-Franco  Microsoft Research Eyal Ofek  Microsoft Research Anthony Steed  University College London,Advances in tracking technology and wireless headsets enable walking as a means of locomotion in Virtual Reality. When exploring virtual environments larger than room-scale  it is often desirable to increase users' perceived walking speed  for which we investigate three methods. (1) Ground-Level Scaling increases users' avatar size  allowing them to walk farther. (2) Eye-Level Scaling enables users to walk through a World in Miniature  while maintaining a street-level view. (3) Seven-League Boots amplifies users' movements along their walking path. We conduct a study comparing these methods and find that users feel most embodied using Ground-Level Scaling and consequently increase their stride length. Using Seven-League Boots  unlike the other two methods  diminishes positional accuracy at high gains  and users modify their walking behavior to compensate for the lack of control. We conclude with a discussion on each technique's strength and weaknesses and the types of situation they might be appropriate for.
The Heat is On: Exploring User Behaviour in a Multisensory Virtual Environment for Fire Evacuation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Emily Shaw  University of Nottingham Tessa Roper  University of Nottingham Tommy Nilsson  University of Nottingham Glyn Lawson  University of Nottingham Sue V. G. Cobb  University of Nottingham Daniel Miller  University of Nottingham,Understanding validity of user behaviour in Virtual Environments (VEs) is critical as they are increasingly being used for serious Health and Safety applications such as predicting human behaviour and training in hazardous situations. This paper presents a comparative study exploring user behaviour in VE-based fire evacuation and investigates whether this is affected by the addition of thermal and olfactory simulation. Participants (N=43) were exposed to a virtual fire in an office building. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of participant attitudes and behaviours found deviations from those we would expect in real life (e.g. pre-evacuation actions)  but also valid behaviours like fire avoidance. Potentially important differences were found between multisensory and audiovisual-only conditions (e.g. perceived urgency). We conclude VEs have significant potential in safety-related applications  and that multimodality may afford additional uses in this context  but the identified limitations of behavioural validity must be carefully considered to avoid misapplication of the technology.
Putting the Value in VR: How to Systematically and Iteratively Develop a Value-Based VR Application with a Complex Target Group,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Hanneke Kip  University of Twente & Stichting Transfore Saskia M. Kelders  University of Twente & North-West University Lisette J.E.W.C Van Gemert-Pijnen  University of Twente,In development  implementation and evaluation of eHealth it is essential to account for stakeholders' perspectives  opinions and values  which are statements that specify what stakeholders want to achieve or improve via a technology. The use of values enables developers to systematically include stakeholders' perspectives and the context of use in an eHealth development process. However  there are relatively few papers that explain how to use values in technology development. Consequently  in this paper we show how we formulated values during the multi-method  interdisciplinary and iterative development process of a VR application for a complex setting: forensic mental healthcare. We report the main foundations for these values: the outcomes of an online questionnaire with patients  therapists and other stakeholders (n=146) and interviews with patients and therapists (n=18). We show how a multidisciplinary project team used these qualitative results to formulate and adapt values and create lo-fi prototypes of a VR application. We discuss the importance of a systematic development process with multiple formative evaluations for eHealth and reflect on the role of values within this.
RealityCheck: Blending Virtual Environments with Situated Physical Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Jeremy Hartmann  University of Waterloo & Microsoft Research Christian Holz  Microsoft Research Eyal Ofek  Microsoft Research Andrew D. Wilson  Microsoft Research,Today's virtual reality (VR) systems offer chaperone rendering techniques that prevent the user from colliding with physical objects. Without a detailed geometric model of the physical world  these techniques offer limited possibility for more advanced compositing between the real world and the virtual. We explore this using a realtime 3D reconstruction of the real world that can be combined with a virtual environment. RealityCheck allows users to freely move  manipulate  observe  and communicate with people and objects situated in their physical space without losing the sense of immersion or presence inside their virtual world. We demonstrate RealityCheck with seven existing VR titles  and describe compositing approaches that address the potential conflicts when rendering the real world and a virtual environment together. A study with frequent VR users demonstrate the affordances provided by our system and how it can be used to enhance current VR experiences.
Does It Feel Real? Using Tangibles with Different Fidelities to Build and Explore Scenes in Virtual Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Thomas Muender  University of Bremen Anke V. Reinschluessel  University of Bremen Sean Drewes  Universität Bremen Dirk Wenig  University of Bremen Tanja Döring  University of Bremen Rainer Malaka  University of Bremen,Professionals in domains like film  theater  or architecture often rely on physical models to visualize spaces. With virtual reality (VR) new tools are available providing immersive experiences with correct perceptions of depth and scale. However  these lack the tangibility of physical models. Using tangible objects in VR can close this gap but creates the challenges of producing suitable objects and interacting with them with only the virtual objects visible. This work addresses these challenges by evaluating tangibles with three haptic fidelities: equal disc-shaped tangibles for all virtual objects  Lego-built tangibles  and 3D-printed tangibles resembling the virtual shapes. We present results from a comparative study on immersion  performance  and intuitive interaction and interviews with domain experts. The results show that 3D-printed objects perform best  but Lego offers a good trade-off between fast creation of tangibles and sufficient fidelity. The experts rate our approach as useful and would use all three versions.
Enhancing Texture Perception in Virtual Reality Using 3D-Printed Hair Structures,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Donald Degraen  Intel Visual Computing Institute (IVCI)  Saarland Informatics Campus André Zenner  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Antonio Krüger  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus,Experiencing materials in virtual reality (VR) is enhanced by combining visual and haptic feedback. While VR easily allows changes to visual appearances  modifying haptic impressions remains challenging. Existing passive haptic techniques require access to a large set of tangible proxies. To reduce the number of physical representations  we look towards fabrication to create more versatile counterparts. In a user study  3D-printed hairs with length varying in steps of 2.5 mm were used to influence the feeling of roughness and hardness. By overlaying fabricated hair with visual textures  the resolution of the user's haptic perception increased. As changing haptic sensations are able to elicit perceptual switches  our approach can extend a limited set of textures to a much broader set of material impressions. Our results give insights into the effectiveness of 3D-printed hair for enhancing texture perception in VR.
Virtual Objects in the Physical World: Relatedness and Psychological Ownership in Augmented Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Lev Poretski  University of Haifa Ofer Arazy  University of Haifa Joel Lanir  University of Haifa Shalev Shachar  The University of Haifa Oded Nov  New York University,As technology advances  people increasingly interact with virtual objects in settings such as augmented reality (AR) where the virtual layer is superimposed on top of the physical world. Similarly to interactions with physical objects  users may assign virtual objects with value  experience a sense of relatedness  and develop psychological ownership over these objects. The objective of this study is to understand how AR's unique characteristics influences the emergence of meaning and ownership perceptions amongst users. We conducted a study of users' interactions with a virtual dog over a three-week period  comparing AR and fully virtual settings. Our findings show that engagement with the application is a key determinant of the relation users develop with virtual objects. However  the effect of the background layer–whether physical or virtual–dominates the development of relatedness and ownership feelings  highlighting the importance of the "real" physical layer in shaping users' perceptions.
Barriers to End-User Designers of Augmented Fabrication,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Chandan Mahapatra  Rochester Institute of Technology Jonas Kjeldmand Jensen  University of Copenhagen Michael McQuaid  Rochester Institute of Technology Daniel Ashbrook  University of Copenhagen,Augmented fabrication is the practice of designing and fabricating an artifact to work with existing objects. Although common both in the wild and as an area for research tools  little is known about how novices approach the task of designing under the constraints of interfacing with real-world objects. In this paper  we report the results of a study of fifteen novice end users in an augmented fabrication design task. We discuss obstacles encountered in four contexts: capturing information about physical objects  transferring information to 3D~modeling software  digitally modeling a new object  and evaluating whether the new object will work when fabricated. Based on our findings  we suggest how future tools can better support augmented fabrication in each of these contexts.

Power Struggles and Disciplined Designers – A Nexus Analytic Inquiry on Cross-Disciplinary Research and Design,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Forth,Netta Iivari  University of Oulu,Design is at the heart of Human Computer Interaction research and practice. In the research community  there has emerged an increasing interest in understanding and conceptualizing our research practice  particularly such entailing design. However  reflective discussion around the associated challenges and practicalities is yet limited. Moreover  so far there is limited discussion on the cross-disciplinary nature of our research and design practices: although cross-disciplinarity has been brought up as an ideal and a necessity  its practicalities and complexities remain yet poorly explored. This study examines a cross-disciplinary research project with a number of researcher-designers representing different disciplines acting as 'designers'  while having a divergent understanding of it and of who has authority to do it. The study relies on nexus analysis as a sensitizing device and shows how various discourses  epistemologies and histories shape cross-disciplinary research and design. Critical reflection around our research practice entailing design is called for.
A Practice-Led Account of the Conceptual Evolution of UX Knowledge,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Forth,Yubo Kou  Florida State University Colin M. Gray  Purdue University,The contours of user experience (UX) design practice have been shaped by a diverse array of practitioners and disciplines  resulting in a diffuse and decentralized body of UX-specific disciplinary knowledge. The rapidly shifting space that UX knowledge occupies  in conjunction with a long-existing research-practice gap  presents unique challenges and opportunities to UX educators and aspiring UX designers. In this paper  we analyzed a corpus of question and answer communication on UX Stack Exchange using a practice-led approach  identifying and documenting practitioners' conceptions of UX knowledge over a nine year period. Specifically  we used natural language processing techniques and qualitative content analysis to identify a disciplinary vocabulary invoked by UX designers in this online community  as well as conceptual trajectories spanning over nine years which could shed light on the evolution of UX practice. We further describe the implications of our findings for HCI research and UX education.
Designing for Digital Playing Out,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Forth,Gavin Wood  Northumbria University Thomas Dylan  Northumbria University Abigail Durrant  Northumbria University Pablo E.

The study forms a design ethnography  combining observational fieldwork with design prototyping and co-creative activities across four linked workshops  where we used BBC micro:bit devices to co-create new IoT designs with the participating children. Our collective account contributes new insights about the physical and interactive features of micro:bits that shaped play  gameplay  and social interaction in the workshops  illuminating an emerging design space for supporting 'digital playing out' that is grounded in empirical instances. We highlight opportunities for designing for digital playing out in ways that promote social negotiation  supports varying participation  allows for integrating cultural influences  and accounts for the weaving together of placemaking and play.
Emotion Work in Experience-Centered Design,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Forth,Madeline Balaam  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Rob Comber  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Rachel E. Clarke  Northumbria University Charles Windlin  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Anna Ståhl  RISE  Research Institutes of Sweden Kristina Höök  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Geraldine Fitzpatrick  Technische Universität Wien,Experience Centered Design (ECD) implores us to develop empathic relationships and understanding of participants  to actively work with our senses and emotions within the design process. However  theories of experience-centered design do little to account for emotion work undertaken by design researchers when doing this. As a consequence  how a design researcher's emotions are experienced  navigated and used as part of an ECD process are rarely published. So  while emotion is clearly a tool that we use  we don't share with one another how  why and when it gets used. This has a limiting effect on how we understand design processes  and opportunities for training. Here  we share some of our experiences of working with ECD. We analyse these using Hochschild's framework of emotion work to show how and where this work occurs. We use our analysis to question current ECD practices and provoke debate.
From Director's Cut to User's Cut: to Watch a Brain-Controlled Film is to Edit it,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Gala,Richard Ramchurn  The University of Nottingham Sarah Martindale  University of Nottingham Max L. Wilson  University of Nottingham Steve Benford  University of Nottingham,Introducing interactivity to films has proven a longstanding and difficult challenge due to their narrative-driven  linear and theatre-based nature. Previous research has suggested that Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) may be a promising approach but also revealed a tension between being immersed in the film and thinking about control. We report a performance-led and in-the-wild study of a BCI film called The MOMENT covering its design rationale and how it was experienced by the public as controllers  non-controllers and repeat viewers. Our findings suggest that BCI movies should be designed to be credibly controllable  generate personal versions  be watchable as linear films  encourage repeat viewing and fit the medium of cinema. They also reveal how viewers appreciated the sense of editing their own personal cuts  suggesting a new stance on introducing interactivity into lean-back media in which filmmakers release editorial control to users to make their own versions.
SuperVision: Playing with Gaze Aversion and Peripheral Vision,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Gala,Argenis Ramirez Gomez  Lancaster University Hans Gellersen  Lancaster University,In this work  we challenge the Gaze interaction paradigm "What you see is what you get" to introduce "playing with peripheral vision". We developed the conceptual framework to introduce this novel gaze-aware game dynamic. We illustrated the concept with SuperVision  a collection of three games that play with peripheral vision. We propose perceptual and interaction challenges that require players not to look and rely on their periphery. To validate the game dynamic and experience  we conducted a user study with twenty-four participants. Results show how the game concept created an engaging and playful experience playing with peripheral vision. Participants showed proficiency in overcoming the game challenges  developing clear strategies to succeed. Moreover  we found evidence that playing the game can affect our visual skills  with greater peripheral awareness.
Lost in Style: Gaze-driven Adaptive Aid for VR Navigation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Gala,Rawan Alghofaili  George Mason University Yasuhito Sawahata  Japan Broadcasting Corporation Haikun Huang  University of Massachusetts Boston Hsueh-Cheng Wang  National Chiao Tung University Takaaki Shiratori  Facebook Reality Labs Lap-Fai Yu  George Mason University,A key challenge for virtual reality level designers is striking a balance between maintaining the immersiveness of VR and providing users with on-screen aids after designing a virtual experience. These aids are often necessary for wayfinding in virtual environments with complex paths. We introduce a novel adaptive aid that maintains the effectiveness of traditional aids  while equipping designers and users with the controls of how often help is displayed. Our adaptive aid uses gaze patterns in predicting user's need for navigation aid in VR and displays mini-maps or arrows accordingly. Using a dataset of gaze angle sequences of users navigating a VR environment and markers of when users requested aid  we trained an LSTM to classify user's gaze sequences as needing navigation help and display an aid. We validated the efficacy of the adaptive aid for wayfinding compared to other commonly-used wayfinding aids.
HeatCraft: Designing Playful Experiences with Ingestible Sensors via Localized Thermal Stimuli,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Gala,Zhuying Li  RMIT University Yan Wang  RMIT University Wei Wang  University of Melbourne Weikang Chen  University of Melbourne Ti Hoang  RMIT University Stefan Greuter  Deakin University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University,Ingestible sensors are pill-like sensors that people swallow mainly for medical purposes. We propose that ingestible sensors also offer unique opportunities to facilitate intriguing bodily experiences in a playful manner. To explore this  we present "HeatCraft"  a two-player system that translates the user's body temperature measured by an ingestible sensor to localized thermal stimuli delivered through a waist belt equipped with heating pads. We conducted a study with 16 participants. The study revealed three design themes (Integration of body and technology  Integration of internal body and outside world  and Integration of play and life) along with some open challenges. In summary  this work contributes knowledge to the future design of playful experiences with ingestible sensors.
FoldTronics: Creating 3D Objects with Integrated Electronics Using Foldable Honeycomb Structures,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Junichi Yamaoka  The University of Tokyo & Massachusetts Institute of Technology Mustafa Doga Dogan  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Katarina Bulovic  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Kazuya Saito  The University of Tokyo Yoshihiro Kawahara  The University of Tokyo Yasuaki Kakehi  The University of Tokyo Stefanie Mueller  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,We present FoldTronics  a 2D-cutting based fabrication technique to integrate electronics into 3D folded objects. The key idea is to cut and perforate a 2D sheet to make it foldable into a honeycomb structure using a cutting plotter; before folding the sheet into a 3D structure  users place the electronic components and circuitry onto the sheet. The fabrication process only takes a few minutes allowing to rapidly prototype functional interactive devices. The resulting objects are lightweight and rigid  thus allowing for weight-sensitive and force-sensitive applications. Finally  due to the nature of the honeycomb structure  the objects can be folded flat along one axis and thus can be efficiently transported in this compact form factor. We describe the structure of the foldable sheet  and present a design tool that enables users to quickly prototype the desired objects. We showcase a range of examples made with our design tool  including objects with integrated sensors and display elements.
LASEC: Instant Fabrication of Stretchable Circuits Using a Laser Cutter,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Daniel Groeger  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus Jürgen Steimle  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus,This paper introduces LASEC  the first technique for instant do-it-yourself fabrication of circuits with custom stretchability on a conventional laser cutter and in a single pass. The approach is based on integrated cutting and ablation of a two-layer material using parametric design patterns. These patterns enable the designer to customize the desired stretchability of the circuit  to combine stretchable with non-stretchable areas  or to integrate areas of different stretchability. For adding circuits on such stretchable cut patterns  we contribute routing strategies and a real-time routing algorithm. An interactive design tool assists designers by automatically generating patterns and circuits from a high-level specification of the desired interface. The approach is compatible with off-the-shelf materials and can realize transparent interfaces. Several application examples demonstrate the versatility of the novel technique for applications in wearable computing  interactive textiles  and stretchable input devices.
ElectroDermis: Fully Untethered  Stretchable  and Highly-Customizable Electronic Bandages,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Eric Markvicka  Carnegie Mellon University Guanyun Wang  Carnegie Mellon University Yi-Chin Lee  Carnegie Mellon University Gierad Laput  Carnegie Mellon University Carmel Majidi  Carnegie Mellon University Lining Yao  Carnegie Mellon University,Wearables have emerged as an increasingly promising interactive platform  imbuing the human body with always-available computational capabilities. This unlocks a wide range of applications  including discreet information access  health monitoring  fitness  and fashion. However  unlike previous platforms  wearable electronics require structural conformity  must be comfortable for the wearer  and should be soft  elastic  and aesthetically appealing. We envision a future where electronics can be temporarily attached to the body (like bandages or party masks)  but in functional and aesthetically pleasing ways. Towards this vision  we introduce ElectroDermis  a fabrication approach that simplifies the creation of highly-functional and stretchable wearable electronics that are conformal and fully untethered by discretizing rigid circuit boards into individual components. These individual components are wired together using stretchable electrical wiring and assembled on a spandex blend fabric  to provide high functionality in a robust form-factor that is reusable. We describe our system in detail— including our fabrication parameters and its operational limits—which we hope researchers and practitioners can leverage. We describe a series of example applications that illustrate the feasibility and utility of our system. Overall  we believe ElectroDermis offers a complementary approach to wearable electronics—one that places value on the notion of impermanence (i.e.  unlike tattoos and implants)  better conforming to the dynamic nature of the human body.
VirtualComponent: A Mixed-Reality Tool for Designing and Tuning Breadboarded Circuits,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Yoonji Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Youngkyung Choi  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Hyein Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Geehyuk Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Andrea Bianchi  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Prototyping electronic circuits is an increasingly popular activity  supported by researchers  who develop toolkits to improve the design  debugging  and fabrication of electronics. Although past work mainly dealt with circuit topology  in this paper we propose a system for determining or tuning the values of the circuit components. Based on the results of a formative study with seventeen makers  we designed VirtualComponent  a mixed-reality tool that allows users to digitally place electronic components on a real breadboard  tune their values in software  and see these changes applied to the physical circuit in real-time. VirtualComponent is composed of a set of plug-and-play modules containing banks of components  and a custom breadboard managing the connections and components' values. Through demonstrations and the results of an informal study with twelve makers  we show that VirtualComponent is easy to use and allows users to test components' value configurations with little effort.
Swire: Sketch-based User Interface Retrieval,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Forrest Huang  University of California  Berkeley John F. Canny  University of California  Berkeley Jeffrey Nichols  Google LLC,Sketches and real-world user interface examples are frequently used in multiple stages of the user interface design process. Unfortunately  finding relevant user interface examples  especially in large-scale datasets  is a highly challenging task because user interfaces have aesthetic and functional properties that are only indirectly reflected by their corresponding pixel data and meta-data. This paper introduces Swire  a sketch-based neural-network-driven technique for retrieving user interfaces. We collect the first large-scale user interface sketch dataset from the development of Swire that researchers can use to develop new sketch-based data-driven design interfaces and applications. Swire achieves high performance for querying user interfaces: for a known validation task it retrieves the most relevant example as within the top-10 results for over 60% of queries. With this technique  for the first time designers can accurately retrieve relevant user interface examples with free-form sketches natural to their design workflows. We demonstrate several novel applications driven by Swire that could greatly augment the user interface design process.
Mobi3DSketch: 3D Sketching in Mobile AR,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Kin Chung Kwan  City University of Hong Kong Hongbo Fu  City University of Hong Kong,Mid-air 3D sketching has been mainly explored in Virtual Reality (VR) and typically requires special hardware for motion capture and immersive  stereoscopic displays. The recently developed motion tracking algorithms allow real-time tracking of mobile devices  and have enabled a few mobile applications for 3D sketching in Augmented Reality (AR). However  they are more suitable for making simple drawings only  since they do not consider special challenges with mobile AR 3D sketching  including the lack of stereo display  narrow field of view  and the coupling of 2D input  3D input and display. To address these issues  we present Mobi3DSketch  which integrates multiple sources of inputs with tools  mainly different versions of 3D snapping and planar/curves surface proxies. Our multimodal interface supports both absolute and relative drawing  allowing easy creation of 3D concept designs in situ. The effectiveness and expressiveness of Mobi3DSketch are demonstrated via a pilot study.
I'm Sensing in the Rain: Spatial Incongruity in Visual-Tactile Mid-Air Stimulation Can Elicit Ownership in VR Users,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Dario Pittera  University of Sussex Elia Gatti  University of Sussex Marianna Obrist  University of Sussex,Major virtual reality (VR) companies are trying to enhance the sense of immersion in virtual environments by implementing haptic feedback in their systems (e.g.  Oculus Touch). It is known that tactile stimulation adds realism to a virtual environment. In addition  when users are not limited by wearing any attachments (e.g.  gloves)  it is even possible to create more immersive experiences. Mid-air haptic technology provides contactless haptic feedback and offers the potential for creating such immersive VR experiences. However  one of the limitations of mid-air haptics resides in the need for freehand tracking systems (e.g.  Leap Motion) to deliver tactile feedback to the user's hand. These tracking systems are not accurate  limiting designers capability of delivering spatially precise tactile stimulation. Here  we investigated an alternative way to convey incongruent visual-tactile stimulation that can be used to create the illusion of a congruent visual-tactile experience  while participants experience the phenomenon of the rubber hand illusion in VR.
Painting with CATS: Camera-Aided Texture Synthesis,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Ticha Sethapakdi  Carnegie Mellon University James McCann  Carnegie Mellon University,We present CATS  a digital painting system that synthesizes textures from live video in real-time  short-cutting the typical brush- and texture- gathering workflow. Through the use of boundary-aware texture synthesis  CATS produces strokes that are non-repeating and blend smoothly with each other. This allows CATS to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. We evaluated the effectiveness of CATS by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that CATS is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings.

Thinking Too Classically: Toward a Research Agenda for Human-Quantum Computer Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Lomond,Zahra Ashktorab  IBM Research AI Justin D. Weisz  IBM Research AI Maryam Ashoori  IBM Research AI,Quantum computing is a fundamentally different way of performing computation than classical computing. Many problems that are considered hard for classical computers may have efficient solutions using quantum computers. Recently  technology companies including IBM  Microsoft  and Google have invested in developing both quantum computing hardware and software to explore the potential of quantum computing. Because of the radical shift in computing paradigms that quantum represents  we see an opportunity to study the unique needs people have when interacting with quantum systems  what we call Quantum HCI (QHCI). Based on interviews with experts in quantum computing  we identify four areas in which HCI researchers can contribute to the field of quantum computing. These areas include understanding current and future quantum users  tools for programming and debugging quantum algorithms  visualizations of quantum states  and educational materials to train the first generation of "quantum native" programmers.
SwarmHaptics: Haptic Display with Swarm Robots,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Lomond,Lawrence H. Kim  Stanford University Sean Follmer  Stanford University,This paper seeks to better understand the use of haptic feedback in abstract  ubiquitous robotic interfaces. We introduce and provide preliminary evaluations of SwarmHaptics  a new type of haptic display using a swarm of small  wheeled robots. These robots move on a flat surface and apply haptic patterns to the user's hand  arm  or any other accessible body parts. We explore the design space of SwarmHaptics including individual and collective robot parameters  and demonstrate example scenarios including remote social touch using the Zooids platform. To gain insights into human perception  we applied haptic patterns with varying number of robots  force type  frequency  and amplitude and obtained user's perception in terms of emotion  urgency  and Human-Robot Interaction metrics. In a separate elicitation study  users generated a set of haptic patterns for social touch. The results from the two studies help inform how users perceive and generate haptic patterns with SwarmHaptics.
On the Internet  Nobody Knows You're a Dog... Unless You're Another Dog,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Lomond,Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas  Aalto University Andrés Lucero  Aalto University,How humans use computers has evolved from human–machine interfaces to human–human computer mediated communication. Whilst the field of animal–computer interaction has roots in HCI  technology developed in this area currently only supports animal– computer communication. This design fiction paper presents animal–animal connected interfaces  using dogs as an instance. Through a co-design workshop  we created six proposals. The designs focused on what a dog internet could look like and how interactions might be presented. Analysis of the narratives and conceived designs indicated that participants' concerns focused around asymmetries within the interaction. This resulted in the use of objects seen as familiar to dogs. This was conjoined with interest in how to initiate and end interactions  which was often achieved through notification systems. This paper builds upon HCI methods for unconventional users  and applies a design fiction approach to uncover key questions towards the creation of animal-to-animal interfaces.
Blockchain Assemblages: Whiteboxing Technology and Transforming Infrastructural Imaginaries,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 09:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 10:20,Lomond,Karim Jabbar  University of Copenhagen Pernille Bjørn  University of Copenhagen,In this paper we unpack empirical data from two domains within the Blockchain information infrastructure: The cryptocurrency trading domain  and the energy domain. Through these accounts we introduce the relational concepts of Blockchain Assemblages and Whiteboxing. Blockchain assemblages comprise configurations of digital and analogue artefacts that are entangled with imaginaries about the current and future state of the Blockchain information infrastructure. Rather than being a black box  Blockchain assemblages alternate between being dynamic and stable entities. We propose Whiteboxing as the sociomaterial process which drives blockchain assemblages in their dynamic state to be (re)configured  while related artefacts and imaginaries are simultaneously transformed  creating dynamic representations. Whiteboxing is triggered during disconfirming events when representations are discovered as problematic. Complementing existing historical accounts demonstrating technologies in the making  the contribution of this paper  proposes whiteboxing as an analytical concept which allows us to unpack how contemporary technologies are created through entrepreneurial activities.

INT001: ScaleDial: A Novel Tangible Device for Teaching Musical Scales & Triads,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Konstantin Klamka  Technische Universität Dresden Jannik Wojnar  Technische Universität Dresden Raimund Dachselt  Technische Universität Dresden,The teaching of harmonic foundations in music is a common learning objective in many education systems. However  music theory is often considered as a non-interactive subject matter that requires huge efforts to understand. With this work  we contribute a novel tangible device  called ScaleDial  that makes use of the relations between geometry and music theory to provide interactive  graspable and playful learning experiences. Therefore  we introduce an innovative tangible cylinder and demonstrate how harmonic relationships can be explored through a physical set of digital manipulatives  that can be arranged and stacked on top of an interactive chromatic circle. Based on the tangible interaction and further rich visual and auditory output capabilities  ScaleDial enables a better understanding of scales  pitch constellations  triads  as well as intervals. Further  we describe the technical realization of our advanced prototype and show how we fabricate the magnetic  capacitive and mechanical sensing.
INT002: ClassBeacons: Enhancing Reflection-in-Action of Teachers through Spatially Distributed Ambient Information,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Pengcheng An  Eindhoven University of Technology Saskia Bakker  Eindhoven University of Technology Sara Ordanovski  Utrecht University Ruurd Taconis  Eindhoven University of Technology Chris L. E. Paffen  Utrecht University Berry Eggen  Eindhoven University of Technology,Reflection-in-action (RiA) refers to teachers' reflections on their teaching performance during busy classroom routines. RiA is a demanding competence for teachers  but little has been known about how HCI systems could support teachers' RiA during their busy and intensive teaching. To bridge this gap  we design and evaluate an ambient information system named ClassBeacons. ClassBeacons aims to help teachers intuitively reflect-in-action on how to divide time and attention over pupils throughout a lesson. ClassBeacons subtly depicts teachers' division of time and attention over pupils through multiple light-objects distributed over students' desks. Each light-object indicates how long the teacher has been cumulatively around it (helping an adjacent student) by shifting color. A field evaluation with eleven teachers proved that ClassBeacons enhanced teachers' RiA by supporting their sensemaking of ongoing performance and modification of upcoming actions. Furthermore  ClassBeacons was experienced to unobtrusively fit into teachers' routines without overburdening teaching in progress.
INT003: Physical Programming for Blind and Low Vision Children at Scale,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Nicolas Villar  Microsoft Research Cecily Morrison  Microsoft Research Daniel Cletheroe  Microsoft Research Tim Regan  Microsoft Research Anja Thieme  Microsoft Research Greg Saul  Microsoft Research,There is a dearth of appropriate tools for young learners with mixed visual abilities to engage with computational learning. Addressing this gap  we present Project Torino  a physical programming language for teaching computational learning to children ages 7-11 regardless of level of vision. To create code  children connect and manipulate tactile objects to create music  audio stories  or poetry. Designed to be made and deployed at scale  Project Torino (along with a scheme of work) has been successfully used by 30 non-specialist teachers with 75 children across the UK over three months.

INT005: Tangible Interactions with Acoustic Levitation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Asier Marzo  Universidad Publica de Navarra Steven Kockaya  University of Bristol Euan Freeman  University of Glasgow Julie Williamson  University of Glasgow,Acoustic Levitation can hold millimetric objects in mid-air without any physical contact. This capability has been exploited to create displays since being able to position mid-air physical voxels enables for rich data representations. However  most of the times interesting features of acoustic levitation are not exploited. Acoustic Levitation is harmless and sound diffracts around objects  thus we can insert our hand inside the levitator and touch the levitated particles without harmful effect on us. In this demo  we showcase more tangible interactions with acoustically levitated particles by passing acoustically-transparent structures through the particles  manipulating particles in mid-air with wearable levitators or by moving multiple particles with direct manipulation. We hope that this demo provides a more tangible experience of acoustic levitation. Since all the presented devices are Do-It-Yourself  we encourage visitors to experiment further with acoustic levitation.

We demonstrate these capabilities with an ultrasonic phased array that allows users to interactively manipulate levitating objects with mid-air hand gestures whilst also receiving auditory feedback via highly directional parametric audio  and haptic feedback via focused ultrasound onto their bare hands. Therefore  this demo presents the first ever ultrasound rig which conveys information to three different sensory channels and levitates small objects simultaneously.

In our demo  we show a concept of futuristic shopping experience with a tangible 3D mid-air interface that allows customers to directly select and explore realistic virtual products using autostereoscopic 3D display combined with mid-air haptics and finger tracker. We also present an example of in-store shopping scenario for natural interactions with 3D. This shopping experience will engage users in producing a memorable in-store experience with the merging of digital and physical interactions.

We demonstrate an implementation of a New York Times style crossword puzzle  providing interactions to query location and stored data  ask for clues in across and down directions  edit and fill in the crossword puzzle using a Perkins style braille keyboard or a typewriter-style keyboard   and verify answers. Through our demonstration  we explore tradeoffs related to available tactile real estate  and overcrowding of the tactile image with a view toward reducing the cognitive workload involved in retaining a working mental model of the active grid  and the time to complete a letter placement task.

However  currently available games fall short because of either limited synchronicity or limited opportunities for player movement. Here  we present Brick  a synchronous multiplayer AR game at the room scale. Brick's players collaborate to fill in a pattern of empty slots using digital "bricks" scattered about the room. This paper provides an overview of Brick from a design and technical perspective. It also discusses how Brick extends the current scope of AR games to include collaborative gameplay.

Depping  University of Saskatchewan Regan Mandryk  University of Saskatchewan James Collin Fey  University of California  Santa Cruz Katherine Isbister  University of California  Santa Cruz,Social closeness is important for an individual's health and well-being  and this is especially difficult to maintain over a distance. Games can help with this  to connect and strengthen relationships or create new ones by enabling shared playful experiences. The demo proposed is a game we designed called 'In the Same Boat'  a two-player game intended to foster social closeness between players over a distance. We leverage the synchronization of both players' physiological data (heart rate  breathing facial expressions) mapped to an input scheme to control the movement of a canoe down a river.

Like in other sports  proper training leads to a faster increase of skill and lessens the risk of injuries. We chose a set of exercises from slackline literature and implemented an interactive trainer which guides the user through the exercises giving feedback if the exercises were executed correctly. Based on lessons learned from our study and prior demonstrations we present a revised version of Slackliner that uses head tracking to better guide the user's attention and movements. Additionally a new visual indicator informs the trainee about her arm posture during the performance. This has been also included in an updated post-analysis view that provides the trainee with more detailed feedback about her performance. The present demo showcases an interactive sports training system that provides in-situ feedback while following a well-guided learning procedure.

Love  Abertay University Mona Bozdog  Abertay University,Ola De La Vida is a three-player cooperative game installation which is designed to harness the qualities of social play environment such as an arcade or play party (an event which mixes games  music  dance and socializing). Ola De La Vida uses physical and digital design techniques that consider the unique qualities of a social play space being sensitive to the complex personal  social and interpersonal aspects each player may experience. The game installation uses its scale to heighten the visibility of the game in a crowded play space  custom control methods to lower barriers to entry and costume to promote teamwork  collaboration and to lower social anxieties. These techniques  in partnership with the digital-physical nature of the game play aims to entice players and spectators in a social environment to participate. Through this installation we hope to encourage discussion around designing for participation and the challenges of social play.

Nacke  University of Waterloo,We introduceCrushed It!  an interactive game on a sensor floor. This floor is combined with a multiple projector system to reduce occlusions from players' interactions with the floor. Individual displays  an HTC Vive to track player position  and smart watches were added to provide an extra layer of interactivity. We created this interactive experience to explore collaboration between people when interacting with large displays. We contribute a novel combination of different technologies for this game system and our studies showed this game is both entertaining and provides players with motivation to stay physically active. We believe presenting at interactivity would be a benefit to both our research and to the attendees of CHI 2019.
INT015: FoldTronics Demo: Creating 3D Objects with Integrated Electronics Using Foldable Honeycomb Structures,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Junichi Yamaoka  Massachusetts Institute of Technology & University of Tokyo Mustafa Doga Dogan  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Katarina Bulovic  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Kazuya Saito  University of Tokyo Yoshihiro Kawahara  University of Tokyo Yasuaki Kakehi  University of Tokyo Stefanie Mueller  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,We present FoldTronics  a 2D-cutting based fabrication technique to integrate electronics into 3D folded objects. The key idea is to cut and perforate a 2D sheet using a cutting plotter to make it foldable into a 3D honeycomb structure; before folding  users place the electronic components and circuitry onto the sheet. The fabrication process only takes a few minutes allowing to rapidly prototype functional interactive devices. The resulting objects are lightweight and rigid  thus allowing for weight-sensitive and force-sensitive applications. Due to the nature of honeycombs  the created objects can be folded flat along one axis and thus can be efficiently transported in this compact form factor.
INT016: Demonstrating Kyub: A 3D Editor for Modeling Sturdy Laser-Cut Objects,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Patrick Baudisch  Hasso Plattner Institute Arthur Silber  Hasso Plattner Institute Yannis Kommana  Hasso Plattner Institute Milan Gruner  Hasso Plattner Institute Ludwig Wall  Hasso Plattner Institute Kevin Reuss  Hasso Plattner Institute Lukas Heilmann  Hasso-Plattner-Institut Robert Kovacs  Hasso Plattner Institute Daniel Rechlitz  Hasso Plattner Institute Thijs Roumen  Hasso Plattner Institute,We present an interactive editing system for laser cutting called kyub. Kyub allows users to create models efficiently in 3D  which it then unfolds into the 2D plates laser cutters expect. Unlike earlier systems  such as FlatFitFab  kyub affords construction based on closed box structures  which allows users to turn very thin material  such as 4mm plywood  into objects capable of withstanding large forces  such as chairs users can actually sit on. To afford such sturdy construction  every kyub project begins with a simple finger-joint "boxel"—a structure we found to be capable of withstanding over 500kg of load. Users then extend their model by attaching additional boxels. Boxels merge automatically  resulting in larger  yet equally strong structures. While the concept of stacking boxels allows kyub to offer the strong affordance and ease of use of a voxel-based editor  boxels are not confined to a grid and readily combine with kuyb's various geometry deformation tools. In our technical evaluation  objects built with kyub withstood hundreds of kilograms of loads. We demonstrate the kyub software to the CHI audience and allow them to experience the resulting models first hand.

This allows CATS to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. We evaluated the effectiveness of CATS by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that CATS is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings.
INT019: Flowboard: A Visual Flow-Based Programming Environment for Embedded Coding,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anke Brocker  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Tony Zelun Zhang  RWTH Aachen University Mathis Müller  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,With Maker-friendly environments like the Arduino IDE  embedded programming has become an important part of STEM education. But learning embedded programming is still hard  requiring both coding and basic electronics skills. To understand if a different programming paradigm can help  we developed Flowboard  which uses Flow-Based Programming (FBP) rather than the usual imperative programming paradigm. Instead of command sequences  learners assemble processing nodes into a graph through which signals and data flow. Flowboard consists of a visual flow-based editor on an iPad  a hardware frame integrating the iPad  an Arduino board and two breadboards next to the iPad  letting learners connect their visual graphs seamlessly to the input and output electronics. Graph edits take effect immediately  making Flowboard a live coding environment.
INT020: Live Programming By Example,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mark Santolucito  Yale University William T. Hallahan  Yale University Ruzica Piskac  Yale University,Live programming is a novel approach for programming practice. Programmers are given real-time feedback when writing code  traditionally via a graphical user interface. Despite live programming's practical values  such as providing an easier overview of code and better understanding of its structure  it is not yet widely used. In this work  we extend live programming to general purpose code editors  which allows for live programming to be used by programmers  and provides new interfaces for understanding and changing the functionality of code. To achieve this we extended a fully-featured IDE with the ability to show input/output examples of code execution  as the programmer is writing code. Furthermore  we integrate programming by example (PBE) synthesis into our tool by allowing the user to change the shown output  and have the code update automatically. Our goal is to use live programming to give novice programmers a new way to interact and understand programming  as well as being a useful development tool for more advanced programmers.
INT021: Dynamic Depth-of-Field Projection for 3D Projection Mapping,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lihui Wang  University of Tokyo Hongjin Xu  University of Tokyo Yunpu Hu  University of Tokyo Satoshi Tabata  University of Tokyo Masatoshi Ishikawa  University of Tokyo,Demonstration for a dynamic depth-of-field projection mapping on a 3D moving object would be performed. Conventional projection mapping was limited on 2D space  due to their narrow depth-of-field projection range. Our system included a high-speed projector  a high-speed variable focus lens  a depth sensor by a stereo camera  so that the depth information would be detected and then served as feedback to correct the focal length of the projection. As a result  a projection mapping would be well-focused projected on a 3D dynamic moving object.
INT022: Demonstration of Springlets: Expressive  Flexible and Silent On-Skin Tactile Interfaces,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Nur Al-huda Hamdan  RWTH Aachen University Adrian Wagner  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University Jürgen Steimle  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus,We present Springlets  expressive  non-vibrating mechanotactile interfaces on the skin. Embedded with shape memory alloy springs  we implement Springlets as thin and flexible stickers to be worn on various body locations  thanks to their silent operation even on the neck and head. We present a technically simple and rapid technique for fabricating a wide range of Springlet interfaces. We developed six modular Springlets: a pincher  a directional stretcher  a presser  a puller  a dragger  and an expander (Fig. 1). In our hands-on demonstration  we show our modular Springlets and several Springlet interfaces for tactile social communication  physical guidance  health interfaces  navigation  and virtual reality gaming. Attendees can wear the interfaces and explore their expressive variable force profiles and spatiotemporal patterns.
INT023: A Sensing Technique for Data Glove Using Conductive Fiber,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ryosuke Takada  University of Tsukuba Junichiro Kadomoto  The Univesity of Tokyo Buntarou Shizuki  University of Tsukuba,We demonstrate a sensing technique for data gloves using conductive fiber. This technique enables us to estimate hand shapes (bend of a finger and contact between fingers) and differentiates a grabbing tag. To estimate how far each finger bends  the electrical resistance of the conductive fiber is measured; this resistance decreases as the finger bends because the surface of the glove short circuits. To detect contact between fingers  we apply alternating currents with different frequencies to each finger and measure the signal propagation between the fingers. This principle is also used to differentiate a grabbing tag (each tag has an alternating current with a unique frequency). We developed a prototype data glove based on this technique.

This interactive artwork is experienced through the HTC Vive headset  with movement and touch key elements to the aesthetic of this work. It combines both a physical and a digital sculpture and in doing so creates a mixed reality that plays on a disconnect between what we can see and what we can feel.
INT028: Hypercept: Speculating the Visual World Intervened by Digital Media,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jiabao Li  Harvard Graduate School of Design Honghao Deng  Harvard Graduate School of Design Panagiotis Michalatos  Harvard Graduate School of Design,Human perception has long been influenced by technological breakthroughs. An intimate mediation of technology lies in between our direct perceptions and the environment we perceive. Through three extreme ideal types of perceptual machines  this project defamiliarizes and questions the habitual ways in which we interpret  operate  and understand the visual world intervened by digital media. The three machines create: Hyper-sensitive vision – a speculation on social media's amplification effect and our filtered communication landscape. Hyper-focused vision – an analogue version of the searching behavior on the Internet. Hyper-commoditized vision – monetized vision that meditates on the omnipresent advertisement targeted all over our visual field. The site of intervention is the visual field in a technologically augmented society. All the three machines have both internal state and external signal.

INT030: Come Hither to Me: Performance of a Seductive Robot,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sahar Sajadieh  University of California  Santa Barbara Hannah Wolfe  University of California  Santa Barbara,Come Hither to Me is an interactive robotic performance  which examines the emotive social interaction between an audience and a robot. Our interactive robot attempts to communicate and flirt with audience members in the gallery. The robot uses feedback from sensors  auditory data  and computer vision techniques to learn about the participants and inform its conversation. The female robot approaches the audience  picks her favorites  and starts charming them with seductive comments  funny remarks  backhanded compliments  and personal questions. We are interested in evoking emotions in the participating audience through their interactions with the robot. Come Hither to Me strives to invert gender roles and stereotypical expectations in flirtatious interactions. This performative piece explores the dynamics of social communication  objectification of women  and the gamification of seduction. The robot reduces flirtation to an algorithm  codifying pick-up lines and sexting paradigms.
INT031: Eyes: Iris Sonification and Interactive Biometric Art,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yoon Chung Han  San Jose State University Praful Surve  California State University  Fullerton,"Eyes" is an interactive biometric data art that transforms human's Iris data into musical sound and 3D animated image. The idea is to allow the audience to explore their own identities through unique visual and sound generated by their iris patterns based on iris recognition and image processing techniques. Selected iris images are printed in 3D sculptures  and it replays the sound and animated images on the sculptures. This research-based artwork has an experimental system generating distinct sounds for each different iris data using visual features such as colors  patterns  brightness and size of the iris. It has potentials to lead the new way of interpreting complicated dataset with the audiovisual output. Moreover  aesthetically beautiful  mesmerizing and uncanny valley-effected artwork can create personalized art experience and multimodal interaction. Multisensory interpretations of this data art can lead a new opportunity to reveal users' narratives and create their own "sonic signature."

INT033: Death Ground,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Christos Michalakos  Abertay University Bernt Isak Wærstad  Norwegian University of Science and Technology,Death Ground is a competitive musical installation-game for two players. The work is designed to provide the framework for the players/participants in which to perform game-mediated musical gestures against each-other. The main mechanic involves destroying the other player's avatar by outmaneuvering and using audio weapons and improvised musical actions against it. These weapons are spawned in an enclosed area during the performance and can be used by whoever is collects them first. There is a multitude of such power-ups  all of which have different properties  such as speed boost  additional damage  ground traps and so on. All of these weapons affect the sound and sonic textures that each of the avatars produce. Additionally  the players can use elements of the environment such as platforms  obstructions and elevation in order to gain competitive advantage  or position themselves strategically to access first the spawned power-ups.
INT034: Keycube is a Kind of Keyboard (k^(3)),Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Damien Brun  Université TÉLUQ Charles Gouin-Vallerand  Université TÉLUQ Sébastien George  Le Mans Université,Alternate realities through headsets  such as augmented  mixed and virtual reality are becoming part of people's everyday life. Except in some limited context  usual keyboards are inappropriate for such technological medium and alternative interfaces for text-entry must be explored. In this paper we present the keycube  a general-purpose cubic handheld device that goes beyond the text-entry interface by including multiple keys  a touch-screen  an inertial unit with six degrees-of-freedom and a vibrotactile feedback. Strong of its form factor and affordance  the keycube offers advantages with regards to mobility  comfort  learnability  privacy and playfulness. Thus  the combination creates a novel text-entry interface convenient for many use cases across the whole reality-virtuality continuum.

Through immersive game-play on the Oculus Rift  users explore Spanish translations of everyday household items in a search-and-find format  scoring points when they can correctly identify and select objects. Users are able to put what they learn into practice in real time. Study participants who tried the experience said they found this method of language learning to be more enjoyable than traditional methods of studying due to the gamification created and it not "feeling like studying". As virtual reality headsets continue to become more accessible to the public  addresses the cost limitations of traveling overseas to achieve immersion in foreign language. This application can be expanded to most real-world scenarios and locations. Additionally  it can be applied to any language.
INT040: Experiencing a Mirrored World with Geotagged Social Media in Geollery,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ruofei Du  University of Maryland  College Park David Li  University of Maryland  College Park Amitabh Varshney  University of Maryland  College Park,We demonstrate the online deployment of Geollery  a mixed reality social media platform. We introduce an interactive pipeline to reconstruct a mirrored world at two levels of detail - the street level and the bird's-eye view. Instead of using offline 3D reconstruction approaches  our system streams and renders a mirrored world in real time  while depicting geotagged social media as billboards  balloons  framed photos  and virtual gifts. Geollery allows multiple users to see  chat  and collaboratively sketch with spatial context in this mirrored world. We demonstrate a wide range of use cases including crowdsourced tourism  interactive audio guide with immersive spatial context  and meeting remote friends in mixed reality. We envision Geollery will be inspiring and useful as a standalone social media platform for those looking to explore new areas or looking to share their experiences. Please refer to https://geollery.com for the paper and live demos.
INT041: Egocentric Smaller-person Experience through a Change in Visual Perspective,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jun Nishida  University of Chicago Soichiro Matsuda  University of Tsukuba Mika Oki  University of Tsukuba Hikaru Takatori  University of Tsukuba Kosuke Sato  University of Tsukuba Kenji Suzuki  University of Tsukuba,This paper explores how human perceptions  actions  and interactions can be changed through an embodied and active experience of being a smaller person in a real-world environment  which we call an egocentric smaller person experience. We developed a wearable visual translator that provides the perspective of a smaller person by shifting the wearer's eyesight level down to their waist using a head-mounted display and a stereo camera module  while allowing for field of view control through head movements. In this study  we investigated how the developed device can modify the wearer's body representation and experiences based on a field study conducted at a nursing school and museums  and through lab studies. Using this device  designers and teachers can understand the perspectives of a smaller-person including a child in an existing environment.

INT044: Multisensory Virtual Environment for Fire Evacuation Training,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tommy Nilsson  University of Nottingham Tessa Roper  University of Nottingham Emily Shaw  University of Nottingham Glyn Lawson  University of Nottingham Sue V. G. Cobb  University of Nottingham Hsieh Meng-Ko  University of Nottingham Daniel Miller  University of Nottingham James Khan  University of Nottingham,Growing organizational safety awareness is propelling the interest in development of novel solutions for fire training. Significant effort in this area has previously gone into designing various immersive virtual reality (VR) systems in hopes of enabling safe exploration and experiencing the consequences of ones actions in scenarios that would be too hazardous in the real life. Yet  the fact that VR generally lacks the sensory feedback of a real life fire situation has been found to impede a sense of realism and validity of such experiences. As part of our efforts to mitigate this issue  we now present a new prototype fire evacuation simulator designed to deliver not just audiovisual feedback  but likewise real-time heat and scent stimulation.
INT045: 3D Positional Movement Interaction with User-Defined  Virtual Interface for Music Software: MoveMIDI,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Timothy Arterbury  Baylor University G. Michael Poor  Baylor University,This paper describes progress made in design and development of a new digital musical instrument (MIDI controller)  MoveMIDI  and highlights its unique 3D positional movement interaction design differing from recent orientational and gestural approaches. A user constructs and interacts with MoveMIDI's virtual  3D interface using handheld position-tracked controllers to control music software  as well as non-musical technology such as stage lighting. MoveMIDI's virtual interface contributes to solving problems difficult to solve with hardware MIDI controller interfaces such as customized positioning and instantiation of interface elements  and accurate  simultaneous control of independent parameters. MoveMIDI's positional interaction mirrors interaction with some physical acoustic instruments and provides visualization for an audience. Beta testers of MoveMIDI have created emergent use cases for the instrument.
INT046: Are Drones Meditative?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Joseph La Delfa  RMIT University Mehmet Aydin Baytas  Qualisys AB Olivia Wichtowski  RMIT University Rohit Ashok Khot  RMIT University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University,Meditative movement involves regulating attention to the body whilst moving  to create a state of meditation. This can be difficult for beginners  we propose that drones can facilitate this as they can move with and give feedback to whole body movements. We present a demonstration that explores various ways drones could facilitate meditative movement by drawing attention to the body. We designed a two-handed control map for the drone that engages multiple parts of the body  a light foam casing to give the impression that the drone is floating and an onboard light which gives feedback to the speed of the movement. The user will experience both leading and following the drone to explore the interplay between mapping  form  feedback and instruction. The demonstration relates to an expansion of the attention regulation framework  which is used to inform the design of interactive meditative experiences and human-drone interactions.
INT047: iScream!: Towards the Design of Playful Gustosonic Experiences with Ice Cream,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yan Wang  RMIT University Zhuying Li  RMIT University Robert Jarvis  RMIT University Rohit Ashok Khot  RMIT University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University,In this demonstration  we present iScream!  a novel gustosonic experience that generates unique digital sounds as a result of eating ice cream. The system uses capacitive sensing to detect eating actions and based on these actions  it plays out six different playful sounds to facilitate a playful eating experience. Our aim is to support a playful way of eating because we believe that interactive technology offers unique opportunities to facilitate novel engaging eating experiences. Ultimately  with this work  we aim to inspire and guide designers working with interactive playful gustosonic experiences  which open up new interaction possibilities to experience eating as play.

INT049: Movie+: Towards Exploring Social Effects of Emotional Fingerprints for Video Clips and Movies,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anton Fedosov  Università della Svizzera italiana Bianca Stancu  Università della Svizzera italiana Elena Di Lascio  Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) Davide Eynard  Università della Svizzera italiana Marc Langheinrich  Faculty of Computer Science,Collaborative movie viewing with the loved ones increases connectedness and social bonds within family members and friends. Furthermore  with the rapid adoption of personal mobile devices  people often engage in this activity being geographically separated. However  conveying our feelings and emotions about a recently watched movie or a video clip is often limited to a post on social media or a short blurb on an instant messaging app. Drawing on the popular interest in quantified-self  which envisioned one collecting and sharing biophysical information from everyday routines (e.g.  workouts)  we have designed and developed Movie+  a mobile application  which utilizes personal biophysical data to construct an individual's "emotional fingerprint" while viewing a video clip. Movie+ allows the selective sharing of this information through different visualization options  as well as rendering others' emotional fingerprints over the same clip. In this submission  we outline the design rationale and briefly describe our application prototype.
INT050: PhotoFlow in Action: Picture-Mediated Reminiscence Supporting Family Socio-Connectivity,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Benett Axtell  University of Toronto Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto & University of Toronto Mississauga,Family connections are maintained through sharing reminiscences  often supported by family photographs which easily prompt memories. This is increasingly important as we age  as picture-based reminiscence has been shown to reduce older adults' social isolation. However  there is a gap between sharing memories from physical pictures and the limited support for oral social reminiscence afforded by digital tools. PhotoFlow supports older adults' picture-mediated social storytelling of family memories using an intuitive metaphor mirroring sharing physical family pictures on a table top. The app uses the speech of oral storytelling to automatically organize pictures based only on what has been said. This simplifies the overall process of family picture interactions by leveraging one enjoyable aspect to ease a more effortful one. In particular  the familiar table top interaction metaphor has the potential to bridge the gap between physical picture reminiscence and managing digital picture collections.
Haptic Navigation Cues on the Steering Wheel,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Patrizia Di Campli San Vito  University of Glasgow Gözel Shakeri  University of Glasgow Stephen Brewster  University of Glasgow Frank Pollick  University of Glasgow Edward Brown  Jaguar Land Rover Ltd. Lee Skrypchuk  Jaguar Land Rover Ltd. Alexandros Mouzakitis  Jaguar Land Rover Ltd.,Haptic feedback is used in cars to reduce visual inattention. While tactile feedback like vibration can be influenced by the car's movement  thermal and cutaneous push feedback should be independent of such interference. This paper presents two driving simulator studies investigating novel tactile feedback on the steering wheel for navigation. First  devices on one side of the steering wheel were warmed  indicating the turning direction  while those on the other side were cooled. This thermal feedback was compared to audio. The thermal navigation lead to 94.2% correct recognitions of warnings 200m before the turn and to 91.7% correct turns. Speech had perfect recognition for both. In the second experiment  only the destination side was indicated thermally  and this design was compared to cutaneous push feedback. The simplified thermal feedback design did not increase recognition  but cutaneous push feedback had high recognition rates (100% for 200 m warnings  98% for turns).
Understanding Personal Productivity: How Knowledge Workers Define  Evaluate  and Reflect on Their Productivity,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Young-Ho Kim  Seoul National University Eun Kyoung Choe  University of Maryland Bongshin Lee  Microsoft Research Jinwook Seo  Seoul National University,Productivity tracking tools often determine productivity based on the time interacting with work-related applications. To deconstruct productivity's diverse and nebulous nature  we investigate how knowledge workers conceptualize personal productivity and delimit productive tasks in both work and non-work contexts. We report a 2-week diary study followed by a semi-structured interview with 24 knowledge workers. Participants captured productive activities and provided the rationale for why the activities were assessed to be productive. They reported a wide range of productive activities beyond typical desk-bound work–ranging from having a personal conversation with dad to getting a haircut. We found six themes that characterize the productivity assessment–work product  time management  worker's state  attitude toward work  impact & benefit  and compound task–and identified how participants interleaved multiple facets when assessing their productivity. We discuss how these findings could inform the design of a comprehensive productivity tracking system that covers a wide range of productive activities.
SRC05: Lake: A Digital Wizard of Oz Prototyping Tool,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Andrew Finke  Northwestern University,Mobile app designers aim to develop the best mobile software interfaces in the least amount of time  and rely on testing ideas with prototypes in lieu of building costly  fully functioning applications. Yet  designers cannot effectively prototype some complex app experiences  including augmented reality applications like Pokémon GO  because existing tools lack the needed features  or because prototyping in them is too time intensive to be feasible. To solve this problem  we introduce Lake  a mobile application prototyping tool that enables the creation of complex mobile applications with the same ease as paper prototyping. By leveraging the Wizard of Oz technique used in paper prototyping in our digital medium  we enable designers to prototype at the same low cost as paper  but at a much higher fidelity. Through a pilot study (N=6)  we find that designers are able to gather organic in-context feedback from complex prototypes made with Lake.
LBW1416: What You Sketch Is What You Get: Quick and Easy Augmented Reality Prototyping with PintAR,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Danilo Gasques  University of California  San Diego Janet G. Johnson  University of California  San Diego Tommy Sharkey  University of California  San Diego Nadir Weibel  University of California  San Diego,Augmented Reality(AR) tools are currently primarily targeted at programmers  making designing for AR challenging and time-consuming. We developed an interactive prototype  PintAR  that enables the authoring and rapid-prototyping of situated experiences by allowing designers to bring their ideas to life using a digital pen for sketching and a head-mounted display for visualizing and interacting with virtual content. In this paper  we explore the versatility such a tool could provide through case studies of a researcher  an artist  a ballerina  and a clinician.
SDC01: NeighBoard: Facilitating Community Policing with Embodied Tech Design,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Crystal Compton  University of Minnesota Ellen Dupler  University of Minnesota J. Walter Lee  University of Minnesota,Augmenting grassroots community policing (CP) efforts with technologies that assist citizens is a promising strategy for reducing real and perceived fear of crime. We used a human-centered design approach  working with residents of the St. Paul Summit-University neighborhood  to discern abstract functionalities for developing new CP technology. We then created and evaluated NeighBoard (Figure 1)  which aims to enhance the social fabric of communities by letting citizens implement their own strategies for preventing crime and maintaining safety in their neighborhood.
SDC02: Co ed: A Classroom Setup for Enhancing Cooperative Learning and Digital Literacy,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anand Kishore  National Institute of Design Cletus V. Joseph  National Institute of Design Lamha Bijili  National Institute of Design Md. Aasif Anwar  National Institute of Design Urvi  National Institute of Design,The current Indian education system promotes competition among students  emphasizing highly on ranks and marks scored. As a consequence  students tend to drift away from a collaborative mindset to a competitive one. The learning gap is even larger in schools catering to lower income groups due to the absence of digital infrastructure and digital knowledge. As a result  a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge  the internet  causing the gap to increase between students in the society. With co ed  we attempt to bridge these gaps by providing a platform to foster mutual learning as well as combining digital mediums and the long-established pen and paper in a seamless manner.
SDC03: Drawxi: An Accessible Drawing Tool for Collaboration,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Suraj Chiplunkar  Indiana University Anany Maini  Indiana University Dinesh Ram  Indiana University Zixuan Zheng  Indiana University Yaxin Zheng  Indiana University Bloomington,Visual impairment can profoundly impact well-being and social advancement. Current solutions for accessing graphical information fail to provide an affordable  user-friendly collaborative platform for visually impaired and sighted people to work together. Therefore  sighted users tend to have low expectations from visually impaired people while working in a team. Hence  visually impaired people feel discouraged to participate in a mixed population collaborative environment. Consequently  their generative capabilities remain devalued. In this paper  we propose an audio-haptic enabled tool (Drawxi) for free-form sketching and sharing simple diagrams (processes  workflows  ideas  perspectives  etc.). It provides a common platform for visually-impaired and sighted people to work together by communicating each other's ideas visually. Thus  enabling the discovery of generative capabilities in a hands-on way. We relied upon participatory research methods (Contextual inquiry  Co-Design) involving visually impaired participants throughout the design process. We evaluated our proposed design through usability testing which revealed that collaboration between visually impaired and sighted people benefits from the use of common tools and platforms. Thereby  enhancing the degree of their participation in a collaborative environment and quality of co-creation activities.
SDC04: Shadoji: View Body Shapes from a Different Angle,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xuan Jin  University of Michigan Peipei Nie  University of Michigan Xizi Wang  University of Michigan Zhuo Wang  University of Michigan Chunying Zhang  University of Michigan,Body shape anxiety is one of the common problems distressing people around the world. While people are constantly suffering from body shape anxiety  they do not realize that beauty standard is not an absolute truth and that it is changing and depends on time and space. To help people free from the constraint imposed by social beauty standards and connect those who have concerns over their body shape  we devised a technological solution named "Shadoji"  which can bring people a new perspective on their body shapes  give them a chance to create their unique body shape emoji  and to explore diverse body shapes from users around the world.
SDC05: Give Me a Break: Design for Communication Among Family Caregivers and Respite Caregivers,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Flannery Currin  Earlham College Gustavo Razo  University of California  Merced Aehong Min  Indiana University Bloomington,This study focuses on solutions to issues that arise from gaps in communication between primary family caregivers of older adults and respite caregivers. We collected data through 18 semi-structured interviews with primary family and respite caregivers and qualitatively analyzed the interviews to extract common needs. Participants identified three main needs that our designs address: building trust through status updates  learning routines & care management  and accessing technology. Based on those needs  we designed a prototype of an application which connects primary family caregivers with respite caregivers and facilitates communication between the involved parties. This design can serve as a framework for future work designed to improve elder care in general  the well-being of caregivers  and the effectiveness of respite care.
SDC06: Amor: Supporting Emerging Adult Couples to Manage Finances for a Common Goal,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mintra Ruensuk  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Jayeong Yoon  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Cho eun Park  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,A healthy romantic relationship is one of the life goals of many couples. Sharing feelings  emotions  thoughts  activities  and even finances enables couples to spend quality time with each other. In particular  financial management plays an important role in relationship quality of emerging adult couples. We present Amor  a mobile application that bridges emerging adult couples closely to pool and spend their money together for a common goal. Amor also allows the couples to explore activities that harmonize with their characteristics as well as an encouragement for the two to achieve their desired goals.
SDC07: SENTI? Reconnect with Yourself to Better Connect with Others,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Audrey Drolet  Université Laval Thomas Lemonde-Marzell  Université Laval Pablo Matos Da Silva  Université Laval Kim Lamontagne  Université Laval Marjorie Bédard  Université Laval,Occidental societies are becoming increasingly demanding. Citizens often feel overwhelmed and feel the need to rest  which they do so by isolating themselves from others. Individuals who use this time alone to reflect on their situation find that this reflection helps create deeper connections with others afterwards. With this in mind  we developed Senti?  a solution that aims to encourage people to take time for themselves in hopes that it will lead them to be more open-minded when interacting with others. The solution helps people focus on bodily sensations and generates a comfortable and effortless time for introspection. Senti? uses the subconscious benefits of perceiving one's heartbeat to foster personal reflection.
SDC08: Haptic Remembrance Book Series,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Elaine Czech  Keio University Mina Shibasaki  Keio University Keitaro Tsuchiya  Keio University,While having strong social networks is essential for good quality of life  socializing gets more difficult as we age even if we are surrounded by people in a nursing home setting. Care staff and family members want to be able to connect with residents/loved ones but have limitations (time constraints  unsure how)  and it can be challenging to feel a connection to another resident who has differing abilities. We propose that through sharing strong positive memories  members of a nursing home community (residents  care staff  and families) will be able to build empathy for one another and thus strengthen their community bonds. By applying multi-modal technologies to a familiar medium  the book  we provided a means by which intergenerational users  from various backgrounds  could interact with and gain meaning from the content.
SDC09: HelloBox: Creating Safer and Kid-friendly Communities,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tab Zhang  University of Minnesota Yongle Zhang  University of Minnesota Leyi Sun  University of Minnesota Lily Dunk  University of Minnesota,Children's ability to walk to school or play around their neighborhoods without parental supervision has severely declined in the past decade. Loss of local activities and mobility may leave children prepared for transitions to adulthood and make them less independent and may have negative health effects. In this paper  we discuss the findings of our research on children's unsupervised play in their neighborhoods. We propose HelloBox  a system including an app  wearable RFID tags  and check-in stations to keep track of children when they are outside without an adult. HelloBox lets parents know where their children are without restricting their independence and builds community between local families. The project focuses on improving children's independent mobility and encouraging social interactions between families within neighborhoods.
SDC10: HearU: An Integrated System to Raise Awareness of Hearing Loss,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Beijia Wang  University of Washington Mengxiao Song  University of Washington Yuting Han  University of Washington Duo Wang  University of Washington,Hearing loss is a prevalent public health crisis that often goes unnoticed in public eye due to its invisibility. People who are hard of hearing (HH) often experience social isolation caused by the lack of understanding from the hearing community. Our research revealed that there is a communication gap between the hearing and HH communities. The current state of art tends to focus on assisting HH people to participate in conversations  which places more responsibility on the HH community. There is a lack of responsibility of people in the hearing community. However  communication works in two directions; it requires both parties to take responsibility. In this paper  we present HearU - an integrated  multichannel system that includes public interaction. Through the creation of an immersive experience that increases people's awareness of hearing loss  we aim to use HearU as a medium to weave these two communities together as a whole.
SDC11: PALS: Patching ALS through Crowdsourced Advice  Social Links & Public Awareness,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Richard Cave  University College London Karina Kocemba  University College London Svjetlana Dajic  University College London Holloe Bostock  University College London Alastair Cook  University College London,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a serious and poorly understood disease  impacting 50 000 people a year globally. Our research found that people with ALS express a lack of connection with other people with the disease  and that the general public lacks awareness about ALS. We also identified an engagement problem with the currently available resources to connect and support people with ALS. To address these issues  we introduce 'PALS' - an accessible crowdsourcing and connection quilt  first hung like a tapestry in the ALS clinic  then later used as an interactive public display. The quilt offers the opportunity to access crowdsourced information concerning individual experiences of ALS. Our work offers three primary contributions: 1) adding to limited HCI research concerning the ALS community by establishing the needs  2) applying the 'PALS' quilt design solution to these needs  and 3) combining three modalities: crowdsourcing  tangible tapestry displays  and interactive waiting education in a unique way.
SDC12: TechBuddies: Engaging Students to Teach Retirees about Technology,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jim Philippe Neussl  University College London Rebecca Zheng  University College London George Hanson  University College London Boyin Yang  University College London,Retirees suffer from impaired mobility  loss of friends and family  and loneliness. Although these problems could be mitigated through the use of digital communication devices and the internet  many retirees lack the skill and confidence to use them effectively. The existing community initiatives that aim to help retirees understand technology often lack volunteers to teach them. This is why we developed TechBuddies  a two-component system aimed at engaging more students as volunteers. The first component consists of an interactive display that raises awareness about volunteering opportunities by simulating an interaction between a retiree and the potential volunteer. The second component involves an app-based platform that facilitates communication about events and encourages long-term engagement. TechBuddies raises awareness about and provides a platform for inter-generational interactions between students and retirees who are a part of the same local community.
LBW0119: Task Influence on Perceptions of a Person-Following Robot and Following-Angle Preferences,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Shanee Honig  Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Hanan Zaichyk  Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Yael Edan  Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Tal Oron-Gilad  Ben Gurion University of the Negev,To improve the design of a person-following robot  this preliminary study evaluates the influence of user tasks on human preferences of the robot's following angle and human perceptions of the robot's behavior. 32 participants were followed by a robot at three different following angles twice  once with an auditory task and once with a visual task  for a total of six walking trials. Results indicate that the type of user task influences participant preferences and perceptions. For the auditory task  as the following angle increased  participants were more satisfied with the robot's following behavior. For the visual task  as the following angle increased  participants were less satisfied with the robot's following behavior. In addition  participants were more perceptive of the robot's following behavior for the auditory task compared to the visual task. Additional research is required to better understand whether human preferences and perceptions depend on task modality or task complexity.
LBW0211: Distributed User-Generated Card Based Co-Design: A Case-Study,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Roos Voorend  KU Leuven Jan Derboven  KU Leuven Karin Slegers  KU Leuven & Tilburg University,Involving end-users is considered key to successful design of technology. It can be challenging  however to involve end-users when designing healthcare technology  due to the limited availability of patients because of their condition or treatment. This is especially difficult when co-designing healthcare technology  which often requires several end-users to collaborate in group activities such as ideation exercises and brainstorms. In an exploration of co-design methods that do not require participants to be co-located  this paper describes initial results from a small-scale ideation workshop in the context of fertility treatment. Preliminary data analysis suggests that user-generated card-based ideation could be used to inspire ideation while transferring knowledge and ideas between participants who are not co-located. This approach could benefit researchers in several healthcare technology settings that use co-design  and other domains where availability of participants is limited.
LBW0212: Augmented Reality for Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alla Vovk  Microsoft Research Ameera Patel  Microsoft Research Dennis Chan  University of Cambridge,Alzheimer's disease (AD)  the most common type of dementia  is characterised by gradual memory loss. There is an increasing global research effort into strategies for early clinic-based diagnosis at the stage where patients present with mild memory problems. Initiating treatment at this stage would slow the progression of the condition and enable more years of good quality life. This paper presents the ongoing development of an augmented reality system using HoloLens that is designed to test an early onset of Alzheimer's disease. The most important aspects in the early AD diagnostics are the symptoms that appear to be connected with early memory loss  in particular spatial memory. The ability to store and retrieve the memory of a particular event involving an association between items such as the place and the object properties is incorporated in a game environment.
LBW0213: The Point-of-Choice Prompt or the Always-On Progress Bar? A Pilot Study of Reminders for Prolonged Sedentary Behavior Change,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yunlong Wang  University of Konstanz Harald Reiterer  University of Konstanz,Prolonged sedentary behavior contributes to many chronic diseases. An appropriate reminder could help screen-based workers to reduce their prolonged sedentary behavior. The fixed-duration point-of-choice prompt has been frequently used in related work. However  this prompting system has several drawbacks. In this paper  we propose the SedentaryBar  a context-aware reminding system using an always-on progress bar to show the duration of a working session  as an alternative to the prompt. The new reminding system uses both users' keyboard/mouse events on the computer and the state-of-the-art computer vision algorithm with the webcam to detect users' presence  which makes the system more accurate and intelligent. Our evaluation study compared the SedentaryBar and the prompt using subjective and objective measurements. After using each method for a week respectively  more participants preferred the SedentaryBar. The participants' perceived interruption and usefulness also suggested the SedentaryBar was more popular during the study. However  the logged data of the participants' working durations indicated the prompt was more effective in reducing their sedentary behavior.
LBW0214: SMART 2.0: A Multimodal Weight Loss Intervention for Young Adults,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lisa M. Grega  University of California  San Diego Nadir Weibel  University of California  San Diego Shadia J. Assi  University of California  San Diego Natalie M. Golaszewski  University of California San Diego Eric B. Hekler  University of California  San Diego Job G. Godino  University of California  San Diego,A significant number of young Americans are vulnerable to excess weight gain  especially during the college years. While technology-based weight loss interventions have the potential to be very engaging  short-term approaches showed limited success. In our work we aim to better understand the impact of long-term  multimodal  technology-based weight loss interventions  and study their potential for greater effect among college students. In this paper we lay the basis for our approach towards a multimodal health intervention for young adults: we present formative work based on interviews and a design workshop with 26 young adults. We discuss our intervention at the intersection of user feedback  empirical evidence from previous work  and behavior change theory.
LBW0215: Designing Family-Centered Aids for the Intensive Care Unit,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Janet G. Johnson  University of California  San Diego Evan Schmitz  University of California  San Diego Venktesh Ramnath  University of California  San Diego Nadir Weibel  University of California  San Diego,Family member involvement has been shown to be key to the well-being and recovery of patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  but they often find themselves overwhelmed and in an emotionally heightened state. ICU care teams  especially nurses  are typically considered to be in the best position to help and provide support to family members of patients. However  the heavy workload  lack of time  and personal interaction styles can make it difficult for them to be receptive to family member needs. To understand how current aids in the ICU are used and the challenges associated with them  we conducted 22 interviews with both family members and the care team. We also created prototypes of family-centered aids through a co-design session to reveal the opportunities that emerge for technology to facilitate family member support in the ICU without adding additional burdens on the care team.
LBW0216: Facebook for Support versus Facebook for Research: The Case of Miscarriage,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mona Y. Alqassim  University of Edinburgh K. Cassie Kresnye  Indiana University Katie A. Siek  Indiana University Maria K. Wolters  University of Edinburgh & Alan Turing Institute,Researchers use Asynchronous Remote Communities (ARC) to reach out to target populations who may find it hard to meet in person  or make time for telephone interviews. So far  ARC studies have been conducted using closed and secure groups on Facebook  because most participants are active members of this social network. However  it is not clear how participants' Facebook usage might affect their engagement with an ARC study. In this paper  we report a secondary analysis of a recent ARC study of women who had experienced at least one miscarriage that focused on their information and social support needs. We find participants tend to be comfortable with seeking emotional support on Facebook  and even those who say they rarely post to Facebook engage with most group activities. We discuss implications for choosing platforms for ARC studies.
LBW0217: Socializing via a Scarf: Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Explore Smart Textiles,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Annuska Zolyomi  University of Washington Taylor Gotfrid  Rochester Institute of Technology Kristen Shinohara  Rochester Institute of Technology,Smart textiles  a subset of wearable technologies  inspire novel human-interactions that leverage people's physical and cognitive actions. However  people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) have different communication  social  and sensory experiences than non-disabled people. We empirically investigate how adults with IDD determine the functionality of smart textiles and which smart textile qualities impact comfort. We demonstrate a research design method that elicits social interaction among adults with IDD. We found that smart textiles facilitate embodied and social interactions among adults with IDD. We also present an emerging design space based on smart textile capabilities and user needs.
LBW0218: MojiBoard: Generating Parametric Emojis with Gesture Keyboards,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jessalyn Alvina  University of British Columbia & LRI  Univ. Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay. Chengcheng Qu  Lancaster University & LRI  Univ. Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay. Joanna McGrenere  University of British Columbia Wendy E. Mackay  Univ. Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay,Inserting emojis can be cumbersome when users must swap through panels. From our survey  we learned that users often use a series of consecutive emojis to convey rich  nuanced non-verbal expressions such as emphasis  change of expressions  or micro stories. We introduce MojiBoard  an emoji entry technique that enables users to generate dynamic parametric emojis from a gesture keyboard. With MojiBoard  users can switch seamlessly between typing and parameterizing emojis.
LBW0219: 3D Positional Movement Interaction with User-Defined  Virtual Interface for Music Software: MoveMIDI,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Timothy Arterbury  Baylor University G. Michael Poor  Baylor University,This paper describes progress made in design and development of a new digital musical instrument (MIDI controller)  MoveMIDI  and highlights its unique 3D positional movement interaction design differing from recent orientational and gestural approaches. A user constructs and interacts with MoveMIDI's virtual  3D interface using handheld position-tracked controllers to control music software  as well as non-musical technology such as stage lighting. MoveMIDI's virtual interface contributes to solving problems difficult to solve with hardware MIDI controller interfaces such as customized positioning and instantiation of interface elements  and accurate  simultaneous control of independent parameters. MoveMIDI's positional interaction mirrors interaction with some physical acoustic instruments and provides visualization for an audience. Beta testers of MoveMIDI have created emergent use cases for the instrument.
LBW0221: The 'Magic Paradigm' for Programming Smart Connected Devices,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Florian Güldenpfennig  New Design University Daniel Dudo  TU Wien Peter Purgathofer  TU Wien,We are surrounded by an increasing number of smart and networked devices. Today much of this technology is enjoyed by gadget enthusiasts and early adaptors  but in the foreseeable future many people will become dependent on smart devices and Internet of Things (IoT) applications  desired or not. To support people with various levels of computer skills in mastering smart appliances as found  e.g.  in smart homes  we propose the 'magic paradigm' for programming networked devices. Our work can be regarded as a playful 'experiment' towards democratizing IoT technology. It explores how we can program interactive behavior by simple pointing gestures using a tangible 'magic wand'. While the 'magic paradigm' removes barriers in programming by waiving conventional coding  it simultaneously raises questions about complexity: what kind of tasks can be addressed by this kind of 'tangible programming'  and can people handle it as tasks become complex? We report the design rationale of a prototypical instantiation of the 'magic paradigm' including preliminary findings of a first user trial.
LBW0222: Exploring Configuration of Mixed Reality Spaces for Communication,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Zhenyi He  New York University Karl Toby Rosenberg  New York University Ken Perlin  New York University,Mixed Reality (MR) enables users to explore scenarios not realizable in the physical world. This allows users to communicate with the help of digital content. We investigate how different configurations of participants and content affect communication in a shared immersive environment. We designed and implemented side-by-side  mirrored face-to-face and eyes-free configurations in our multi-user MR environment and conducted a preliminary user study for our mirrored face-to-face configuration  evaluating with respect to one-to-one interaction  smooth focus shifts and eye contact within a 3D presentation using the interactive Chalktalk system. We provide experimental results and interview responses.
LBW0223: Ohmic-Sticker: Force-to-Motion Type Input Device for Capacitive Touch Surface,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Kaori Ikematsu  Ochanomizu University Masaaki Fukumoto  Microsoft Research Itiro Siio  Ochanomizu University,We propose "Ohmic-Sticker"  a novel force-to-motion type input device to extend capacitive touch surfaces. It realizes various types of force-sensitive inputs by attaching on commercial capacitive touch surfaces. A simple force-sensitive-resistor (FSR)-based structure enables thin (less than 2 mm) form factors and battery-less operation. The applied force vector is detected as the leakage current from the corresponding touch surface electrodes by using "Ohmic-Touch" technology. Ohmic-Sticker can be used for adding force-sensitive interactions to touch surfaces  such as analog push buttons  the TrackPoint-like pointing devices  and full 6 DoF controllers for navigating virtual spaces.
LBW0224: One-handed Rapid Text Selection and Command Execution Method for Smartphones,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Toshiyuki Ando  University of Tsukuba Toshiya Isomoto  University of Tsukuba Buntarou Shizuki  University of Tsukuba Shin Takahashi  University of Tsukuba,We show a one-handed rapid text selection and command execution method for a smartphone; we term this Press & Slide. The user can perform caret navigation or text selection by sliding the finger on a software keyboard after pressing a key. Then  by releasing the key  a command such as "copy the selected text" is executed; the command is specified by the key that is pressed. Therefore  the user needs not touch the text  and thus the fat finger problem does not cause and the user needs not change his/her smartphone grip.
LBW0225: Assessing the Feasibility of Speech-Based Activity Recognition in Dynamic Medical Settings,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Swathi Jagannath  Drexel University Aleksandra Sarcevic  Drexel University Neha Kamireddi  Drexel University Ivan Marsic  Rutgers University,We describe an experiment conducted with three domain experts to understand how well they can recognize types and performance stages of activities using speech data transcribed from verbal communications during dynamic medical teamwork. The insights gained from this experiment will inform the design of an automatic activity recognition system to alert medical teams to process deviations in real time. We contribute to the literature by (1) characterizing how domain experts perceive the dynamics of activity-related speech  and (2) identifying the challenges associated with system design for speech-based activity recognition in complex team-based work settings.
LBW0226: Are You There? Identifying Unavailability in Mobile Messaging,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Pranut Jain  University of Pittsburgh Rosta Farzan  University of Pittsburgh Adam J. Lee  University of Pittsburgh,Delays in response to mobile messages can cause negative emotions in message senders and can affect an individual's social relationships. Recipients  too  feel a pressure to respond even during inopportune moments. A messaging assistant which could respond with relevant contextual information on behalf of individuals while they are unavailable might reduce the pressure to respond immediately and help put the sender at ease. By modelling attentiveness to messaging  we aim to (1) predict instances when a user is not able to attend to an incoming message within reasonable time and (2) identify what contextual factors can explain the user's attentiveness---or lack thereof---to messaging. In this work  we investigate two approaches to modelling attentiveness: a general approach in which data from a group of users is combined to form a single model for all users; and a personalized approach  in which an individual model is created for each user. Evaluating both models  we observed that on average  with just seven days of training data  the personalized model can outperform the generalized model in terms of both accuracy and F-measure for predicting inattentiveness. Further  we observed that in majority of cases  the messaging patterns identified by the attentiveness models varied widely across users. For example  the top feature in the generalized model appeared in the top five features for only 41% of the individual personalized models.
LBW0227: Older Adults as Makers of Custom Electronics: Iterating on Craftec,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ben Jelen  Indiana University Susan Monsey  Indiana University Katie A. Siek  Indiana University,Researchers have designed technologies for and with older adults to help them age in place  but there is an opportunity to support older adults in creating customized smart devices for themselves through electronic toolkits. We developed a plan for iterating on Craftec - one of the first electronic toolkits designed for older adults - informed by the results of a participatory design workshop and user evaluation. We focused on supporting older adults to create exemplar artifacts  such as medication adherence systems. We contribute the exemplars and the current plan for components of the Craftec system as a way to support older adults to design technology for themselves.
LBW0228: Takeover and Handover Requests using Non-Speech Auditory Displays in Semi-Automated Vehicles,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Kyle Kutchek  Michigan Technological University Myounghoon Jeon  Virginia Tech,Since non-speech sounds can convey urgency well  they have been used as alerts in the vehicle context  including control transitions (handover and takeover) in automated vehicles. However  their potential has not been fully investigated to make use in international standards. To contribute to making authentic standards  the present paper investigated the effects of various non-speech displays to further refine auditory variables. Twenty-four young drivers drove in the driving simulator that had both handover and takeover transitions between manual and automated modes with a secondary task. The reaction times for handover and takeover and other sound user experience questionnaire results are reported with discussions and future work.
LBW0229: Multimodal Displays for Take-over in Level 3 Automated Vehicles while Playing a Game,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Myounghoon Jeon  Virginia Tech,Take-over is one of the most crucial user interactions in semi-automated vehicles. To make better communication between driver and vehicle  research has been conducted on various take-over request displays  yet the potential has not been fully investigated. The present paper explored the effects of adding auditory displays to visual text. Earcon and speech showed the best performance and acceptance with spearcon the least. This study is expected to provide the basic data and guidelines for future research and design practice.
LBW0231: From Motions to Emotions: Classification of Affect from Dance Movements using Deep Learning,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sukumar Karumuri  University of Genoa Radoslaw Niewiadomski  University of Genoa Gualtiero Volpe  University of Genova Antonio Camurri  University of Genoa,This work investigates classification of emotions from MoCap full-body data by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Rather than addressing regular day to day activities  we focus on a more complex type of full-body movement - dance. For this purpose  a new dataset was created which contains short excerpts of the performances of professional dancers who interpreted four emotional states: anger  happiness  sadness  and insecurity. Fourteen minutes of motion capture data are used to explore different CNN architectures and data representations. The results of the four-class classification task are up to 0.79 (F1 score) on test data of other performances by the same dancers. Hence  through deep learning  this paper proposes a novel and effective method of emotion classification  which can be exploited in affective interfaces.
LBW0232: WONDER -- Enhancing VR Training with Electrical Muscle Stimulation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Max Pfeiffer  University of Munster Tobias Kröger  University of Münster Jens Seifert  University of Münster Sulaxan Somaskantharajan  University of Münster Lukas Jahnich  University of Münster Tobias Steinblum  University of Münster Jan Speckamp  University of Münster Samuel Navas Medrano  University of Münster,Training employees on workplace procedures in virtual environments (VEs) is becoming popular since it reduces cost and risks. Although haptic enhancements with force feedback make such VEs more realistic and increase performance. Such enhancements are only available for 'spatial' scenarios. One potential enhancement for low-cost VEs is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)  but it remains open how EMS can be used to support trainees. Therefore we present WONDER: A virtual training environment with an EMS feedback enhancing layer. In an initial study  we show the feasibility of the approach and that it can successfully support trainees in remembering workflows. We test feedback that supports participants by pushing their hand towards a button or pulling their hand away from it. Participants preferred a combination of both feedback types.
LBW0233: Exploring Word-gesture Text Entry Techniques in Virtual Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sibo Chen  University of California  Berkeley & Chinese University of Hong Kong  Shenzhen Junce Wang  University of California  Berkeley & Chinese University of Hong Kong  Shenzhen Santiago Guerra  University of California  Berkeley Neha Mittal  University of California  Berkeley Soravis Prakkamakul  University of California  Berkeley,Efficient text entry is essential to any computing system. However  text entry methods in virtual reality (VR) currently lack the predictive aid and physical feedback that allows users to type efficiently. The state of the art methods such as using physical keyboards with tracked hand avatars require a complex setup which might not be accessible to the majority of VR users. In this paper  we propose two novel ways to enter text in VR: 1) Word-gesture typing using six degrees of freedom (6DOF) VR controllers; and 2) word-gesture typing using pressure-sensitive touchscreen devices. Our early stage pilot experiment shows that users were able to type at 16.4 WPM and 9.6 WPM on the two techniques respectively without any training  while an expert's typing speeds reached up to 34.2 WPM and 22.4 WPM. Users subjectively preferred the VR controller method over the touchscreen one in terms of usability and task load. We conclude that both techniques are practical and deserve further study.
LBW0234: YourAd: A User Aligned  Personal Advertising System,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,David Ramsay  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Joseph A. Paradiso  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Advertisers have optimized the periphery of our attention to drive complex purchasing behavior  typically using persuasive or rhetorical techniques to promote decisions that are agnostic to our best interest. Instead of serving the ambition of companies with large marketing budgets  what if these techniques were used to reinforce the behaviors and attachments we choose for ourselves? YourAd is an open-source browser extension and design tool that allows users to supplant their internet ads with custom replacements-- designed by and for themselves. YourAd incorporates industry best practices into a platform to facilitate experimentation with user-aligned advertisement ecosystems  probe the limits of their influence  and optimize their design in support of an end user's personal aspiration.
LBW0235: Paralympic VR Game: Immersive Game using Virtual Reality and Video,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Raquel Macedo  Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia  Universidade Nova de Lisboa Nuno Correia  Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia  Universidade Nova de Lisboa Teresa Romão  Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia  Universidade Nova de Lisboa,In the last few years  the interest in virtual reality has been increasing partially due to the emergence of cheaper and more accessible hardware  and the increase in content available. One of the possible applications for virtual reality is to lead people into seeing situations from a different perspective  which can help change beliefs. The work reported in this paper uses virtual reality to help people better understand paralympic sports by allowing them to experience the sports' world from the athletes' perspective. For the creation of the virtual environment  both computer-generated elements and 360 video are used. This work focused on wheelchair basketball  and a simulator of this sport was created resorting to the use of a game engine (Unity 3D). For the development of this simulator  computer-generated elements were built  and the interaction with them implemented. User studies were conducted to evaluate the sense of presence  motion sickness and usability of the system developed. The results were positive although there are still some aspects that should be improved.
LBW0236: Using Social Platforms to Increase Engagement in Teaching Computer Programming,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Aderonke Busayo Sakpere  University of Ibadan,Programming has the potential to bring to life that which is most minute in man's imagination. Imagination  however  it will all remain  if no appropriate intervention is made to facilitate the learning of programming. Research studies show that the traditional  face-to-face method of teaching does not provide an enabling environment for learning programming. Hence  outside-classroom intervention is called for. Certain previous studies have tried to build new tools to support the outside-classroom intervention. However  there a need to study the use of existing  familiar and relaxing environments  such as social media  for this intervention. In this paper  we investigate the capability of a social media platform to support the learning of programming among learners in the developing world. We chose the WhatsApp platform as the starting point to uncover these design needs. We also reflected on the lessons learnt using this intervention.
LBW0237: Cyborg Botany: Exploring In-Planta Cybernetic Systems for Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Harpreet Sareen  Parsons School of Design & Massachusetts Institute of Technology Pattie Maes  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Our traditional interaction possibilities have centered around our electronic devices. In recent years  the progress in electronics and material science has enabled us go beyond chip layer and work at the substrate level. This has helped us rethink form  sources of power  hosts and in turn new interaction possibilities. However  the design of such devices has mostly been ground up and fully synthetic. In this paper  we discuss the analogy between artificial functions and natural capabilities in plants. Through two case studies  we demonstrate bridging unique natural operations of plants with the digital world. Each desired synthetic function is grown  injected carefully or placed in conjunction with a plant's natural functions. Our goal is to make use of sensing and expressive abilities of nature for our interaction devices. Merging synthetic circuitry with plant's own physiology could pave a way to make these lifeforms responsive to our interactions and their ubiquitous sustainable deployment.
LBW0238: Towards Understanding Interactions with Multi-Touch Spherical Displays,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Nikita Soni  University of Florida Sayli Bapat  Maharashtra Institute of Technology Schuyler Gleaves  University of Florida Alice Darrow  University of Florida Carrie Schuman  University of Florida Hannah Neff  University of Florida Peter Chang  University of Florida Kathryn A. Stofer  University of Florida Lisa Anthony  University of Florida,Interactive spherical displays offer unique educational and entertainment opportunities for both children and adults in public spaces. However  designing interfaces for spherical displays remains difficult because we do not yet fully understand how users naturally interact with and collaborate around spherical displays. This paper reports current progress on a project to understand how children (ages 8 to 13) and adults interact with spherical displays in a real-world setting. Our initial data gathering includes an exploratory study in which children and adults interacted with a prototype application on a spherical display in small groups in a public setting. We observed that child groups tended to interact more independently around the spherical display  whereas adult groups interacted with the sphere in a driver-navigator mode and did not tend to walk around the sphere. This work will lay the groundwork for future research into designing interactive applications for spherical displays tailored towards users of all age groups.
LBW0239: Controlling Temporal Change of a Beverage's Taste Using Electrical Stimulation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Saraha Ueno  Meiji University Kazuma Aoyama  The University of Tokyo Hiromi Nakamura  Meiji University Homei Miyahita  Meiji University,In this paper  we discuss concepts for improving beverage experience using electrical stimulation in terms of the requirements for the procedure (design space)  previous study (completion)  and limitations of conventional technologies. To improve beverage experience  electrical stimulation has been indicated as a method for changing a beverage's taste. However  the taste of a beverage changes temporally—a beverage's taste during drinking is different from its taste after swallowing. There are methods of evaluating the taste of a beverage based on time-series  such as the Time-Intensity (TI) method and the Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) method. Therefore  it is important to focus on the temporal change in a beverage's taste for improving the beverage experience. Thus  we focused on the taste before and after swallowing as a first step. Based on this review  we propose the concept of controlling the temporal change of a beverage's taste using electrical stimulation.
LBW0241: Ways of Qualitative Coding: A Case Study of Four Strategies for Resolving Disagreements,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Bonnie Chinh  University of Washington Himanshu Zade  University of Washington Abbas Ganji  University of Washington Cecilia Aragon  University of Washington,The process of qualitative coding often involves multiple coders coding the same data to ensure reliable codes and a consistent understanding of the codebook. One aspect of qualitative coding includes resolving disagreements  where coders discuss differences in coding to reach a consensus. We conduct a case study to evaluate four strategies of disagreement resolution and understand their impact on the coding process. We find that an open discussion and the n-ary tree metric lead coders to focus more on the disagreement of a particular data instance  whereas kappa values and Code Wizard direct coders to compare code definitions. We discuss opportunities for using different strategies at different stages of the coding process for more effective disagreement resolution.
LBW0242: Feeling-of-Safety Slider: Measuring Pedestrian Willingness to Cross Roads in Field Interactions with Vehicles,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Francesco Walker  University of Twente Debargha Dey  Eindhoven University of Technology Marieke Martens  University of Twente Bastian Pfleging  Eindhoven University of Technology Berry Eggen  Eindhoven University of Technology Jacques Terken  Eindhoven University of Technology,Can interactions between automated vehicles and pedestrians be evaluated in a quantifiable and standardized way? In order to answer this  we designed an input device in the form of a continuous slider that enables pedestrians to indicate their willingness to cross a road and their feeling of safety in real time in response to an approaching vehicle. In an initial field study  71% of the participants reported that they were able to use the device naturally and indicate their feeling of safety satisfactorily. The feeling-of-safety slider can consequently be used to evaluate and benchmark interactions between pedestrians and vehicles  and compare communication interfaces for automated vehicles.
LBW0243: The Impact of Placebic Explanations on Trust in Intelligent Systems,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Malin Eiband  LMU Munich Daniel Buschek  LMU Munich Alexander Kremer  LMU Munich Heinrich Hussmann  LMU Munich,Work in social psychology on interpersonal interaction has demonstrated that people are more likely to comply to a request if they are presented with a justification - even if this justification conveys no information. In the light of the many calls for explaining reasoning of interactive intelligent systems to users  we investigate whether this effect holds true for human-computer interaction. Using a prototype of a nutrition recommender  we conducted a lab study (N=30) between three groups (no explanation  placebic explanation  and real explanation). Our results indicate that placebic explanations for algorithmic decision-making may indeed invoke perceived levels of trust similar to real explanations. We discuss how placebic explanations could be considered in future work.
LBW0244: Can Privacy-Aware Lifelogs Alter Our Memories?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Passant Elagroudy  University of Stuttgart Mohamed Khamis  University of Glasgow Florian Mathis  LMU Munich Diana Irmscher  LMU Munich Andreas Bulling  University of Stuttgart Albrecht Schmidt  LMU Munich,The abundance of automatically-triggered lifelogging cameras is a privacy threat to bystanders. Countering this by deleting photos limits relevant memory cues and the informative content of lifelogs. An alternative is to obfuscate bystanders  but it is not clear how this impacts the lifelogger's recall of memories. We report on a study in which we compare viewing 1) unaltered photos  2) photos with blurred people  and 3) a subset of the photos after deleting private ones  on memory recall. Findings show that obfuscated content helps users recall a lot of content  but it also results in recalling less accurate details  which can sometimes mislead the user. Our work informs the design of privacy-aware lifelogging systems that maximizes recall and steers discussion about ubiquitous technologies that could alter human memories.
LBW0245: Robots are Always Social: Robotic Movements are Automatically Interpreted as Social Cues,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hadas Erel  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Tzachi Shem Tov  The Interdisciplinary Center(IDC) Herzliya Yoav Kessler  Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Oren Zuckerman  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya,Physical movement is a dominant element in robot behavior. We evaluate if robotic movements are automatically interpreted as social cues  even if the robot has no social role. 24 participants performed the Implicit Associations Test  classifying robotic gestures into direction categories ("to-front" or "to-back") and words into social categories (willingness or unwillingness for interaction). Our findings show that social interpretation of the robot's gestures is an automatic process. The implicit social interpretation influenced both classification tasks  and could not be avoided even when it decreased participant's performance. This effect is of importance for the HCI community as designers should consider  that even if a robot is not intended for social interaction (e.g. factory robot)  people will not be able to avoid interpreting its movement as social cues. Interaction designers should leverage this phenomenon and consider the social interpretation that will be automatically associated with their robots' movement.
LBW0246: The Role of HCI in Reproducible Science: Understanding  Supporting and Motivating Core Practices,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sebastian S. Feger  LMU Munich & CERN Sünje Dallmeier-Tiessen  CERN Paweł W. Woźniak  Utrecht University Albrecht Schmidt  LMU Munich,The reproducibility crisis refers to the inability to reproduce scientific experiments and is one of science's great challenges. Alarming reports and growing public attention are leading to the development of services and tools that aim to support key reproducible practices. In the face of this rapid evolution  we envision the unique opportunity for Human-Computer Interaction to impact scientific practice through the systematic study of requirements and moderating effects of technology on research reproducibility. In this paper  we report on the current state of technological and human factors in reproducible science and present challenges and opportunities for both HCI researchers and practitioners to understand  support and motivate core practices.
LBW0247: Accessible Instruments in the Wild: Engaging with a Community of Learning-Disabled Musicians,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jacob Harrison  Queen Mary University of London Alan Chamberlain  University of Nottingham Andrew P. McPherson  Queen Mary University of London,Disabled people face many barriers to access in all areas of life  including creative expression. With music making  a lack of accessible instruments can be a major barrier  as well as environmental factors. The Strummi is an accessible instrument based on the guitar  designed as a technology probe to explore the technical and cultural role of guitar-like design and interaction modality. We have been collaborating with Heart n Soul  an arts charity that works with young people and adults with learning disabilities. In this paper  we share findings from the first year of this collaboration  and reflect on the implications for doing HCI research with learning-disabled communities. We took a longitudinal  situated approach with an intentionally simple technology inspired by in the wild and technology probe methodologies  allowing for interest in the Strummi to grow organically.
LBW0248: Designing the Next Generation of Activity Trackers for Performance Sports: Insights from Elite Tennis Coaches,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hayati Havlucu  Koç University Aykut Coşkun  Koç University Oğuzhan Özcan  Koç University,Wearable sport technologies and activity trackers help sportspeople by providing physiological information on their performance. However  professional sportspeople find this information irrelevant due to their high-performance training. They want these devices to provide real-time assistive feedback on their performance  despite the formidable limitations suggested by previous research on giving such feedback. On the other hand  sport coaches already give performance feedback to their sportspeople during their performance. We speculated that some of their approaches might give clues for designing activity trackers with useful real-time performance feedback. Consequently  we interviewed six elite tennis coaches to explore their approaches of communicating performance information to their players  during tennis games. In this paper  we discussed the findings by comparing them with related work and formed two design insights for giving real-time performance feedback that might lead to novel approaches for activity trackers.
LBW0249: DIY Community WiFi Networks: Insights on Participatory Design,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Michael Smyth  Edinburgh Napier University Ingi Helgason  Edinburgh Napier University,This paper presents a first version of a set of insights developed collaboratively by researchers during a three-year participatory design project spread across four European locations. The MAZI project explored potential uses of a "Do-It-Yourself" WiFi networking technology platform. Built using low-cost Raspberry Pi computer hardware and specially developed  open-source software  this toolkit has the potential to enable hyper-local applications and services to be developed and maintained within a host community for its own use. The nine insights are a distillation and articulation of the collective reflections of the project partners gained from their experiences of working in diverse settings with varied communities and stakeholders. In this paper  we discuss the reflective process  we present the insights to the CHI community in order to gain feedback  and we situate our findings within previous literature.
LBW0251: Trail of Hacks: Poster Co-Design as a Tool for Collaborative Reflection,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Janis Lena Meissner  Newcastle University Nicholas Packham  Newcastle University Norman Platt  Newcastle University Peter Wright  Newcastle University,This paper describes a process of collaborative sense-making through co-designing a reflective poster. We used this method in the 'Empowering Hacks' project which gathered two non-academic individuals with disabilities (authors 2 & 3) and a non-disabled HCI researcher (author 1) around DIY/Making by  for and with people with disabilities. To collectively review the achievements and challenges we experienced in this project  we designed a timeline which allowed us to equally engage in reflective thinking and curatorial discussions on how to present and explain identified key moments. We see the instance of this co-created poster as an opportunity to discuss with the CHI-community the potential and relevance of including research participants in analysis processes.
LBW0252: Chats with Bots: Balancing Imitation and Engagement,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Andreea Muresan  University of Copenhagen Henning Pohl  University of Copenhagen,Advances in AI are paving the way towards more natural interactions  blurring the line between bot and human. We present findings from a two-week diary study exploring users' interactions with the chatbot Replika. In particular  we focus on how users anthropomorphize chatbots and how this influences their engagement. We find that failing to adhere to social norms and glaring signs of humanity leads to decreased engagement unless balanced appropriately.
LBW0253: Wake-Up Task: Understanding Users in Task-based Mobile Alarm App,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Kyue Taek Oh  Hanyang University Jaemyung Shin  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Jaejeung Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology In Suk Song  Hanyang University Uichin Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Eunil Park  Sungkyunkwan University Jinyoung Han  Hanyang University Minsam Ko  Hanyang University,Popular alarm apps are offering task-based alarms that do not allow the user to dismiss an alarm unless they complete a specific task (e.g.  solving math problems). Because such wake-up tasks cause discomforts  their usefulness and necessity could vary among individuals and their context. In this work  we aimed to understand the characteristics of Alarmy (task-based alarm app) users who (dis) likes wake-up task in terms of alarm set usage. We grouped 8 500 US users into three according to the proportion of the task selection and investigated group-wise usage differences. We found significant usage differences among the groups in terms of (1) set frequency  (2) set time  and (3) set consistency  possibly caused by consistent needs and task difficulty. The results suggest promising directions for inconvenient interaction and behavior change research.
LBW0254: Push Away the Smartphone: Investigating Methods to Counter Problematic Smartphone Use,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Charlie Pinder  Independent Researcher Jose Ignacio Rocca  Universidad ORT Uruguay Benjamin R. Cowan  University College Dublin Russell Beale  University of Birmingham,There is a growing need to support people to counter problematic smartphone use. We analyse related research in methods to address problematic usage and identify a research gap in off-device retraining. We ran a pilot to address this gap  targeting automatic approach biases for smartphones  delivered on a Tabletop surface. Our quantitative analysis (n=40) shows that self-report and response-time based measures of problematic smartphone usage diverge. We found no evidence that our intervention altered reaction time-based measures. We outline areas of discussion for further research in the field.
LBW0255: "I Almost Fell in Love with a Machine": Speaking with Computers Affects Self-disclosure,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Qian Yu  University of California  Berkeley Tonya Nguyen  University of California  Berkeley Soravis Prakkamakul  University of California  Berkeley Niloufar Salehi  University of California  Berkeley,Listening and speaking are tied to human experiences of closeness and trust. As voice interfaces gain mainstream popularity  we ask: is our relationship with technology that speaks with us fundamentally different from technology we use to read and type? In particular  will we disclose more about ourselves to computers that speak to us and listen to our answer? We examine this question through a controlled experiment where a conversational agent asked participants closeness-generating questions common in social psychology through either text-based or voice-based interfaces. We found that people skipped more invasive questions when reading-typing compared to speaking-listening. Surprisingly  typing in their answers seemed to increased the propensity for self-disclosure. This research has implications for the future design of voice-based conversational agents and deepens concerns of user privacy.
LBW0256: Go for GOLD: Investigating User Behaviour in Goal-Oriented Tasks,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sarah Prange  University of Applied Sciences Munich & LMU Munich Daniel Buschek  LMU Munich Ken Pfeuffer  Bundeswehr University Munich Lukas Mecke  University of Applied Sciences Munich & LMU Munich Peter Ehrich  LMU Munich Jens Le  University of Applied Sciences Munich & Technical University of Munich Florian Alt  Bundeswehr University Munich,Building adaptive support systems requires a deep understanding of why users get stuck or face problems during a goal-oriented task and how they perceive such situations. To investigate this  we first chart a problem space  comprising different problem characteristics (complexity  time  available means  and consequences). Secondly  we map them to LEGO assembly tasks. We apply these in a lab study (N=22) equipped with several tracking technologies (i.e.  smartwatch sensors and an OptiTrack setup) to assess which problem characteristics lead to measurable consequences in user behaviour. Participants rated occurred problems after each task. With this work  we suggest first steps towards a) understanding user behaviour in problem situations and b) building upon this knowledge to inform the design of adaptive support systems. As a result  we provide the GOLD dataset (Goal-Oriented Lego Dataset) for further analysis.
LBW0257: Designing for Preregistration: A User-Centered Perspective,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xiaoying Pu  University of Michigan Licheng Zhu  University of Michigan Matthew Kay  University of Michigan Frederick Conrad  University of Michigan,The replication crisis---a failure to replicate foundational studies---has sparked a conversation in psychology  HCI  and beyond about scientific reliability. To address the crisis  researchers increasingly adopt preregistration: the practice of documenting research plans before conducting a study. Done properly  preregistration should reduce bias from taking exploratory findings as confirmatory. It is crucial to treat preregistration  often an online form/template  as a user-centered design problem to ensure preregistration achieves its intended goal. To understand preregistration in practice  we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with preregistration users (researchers) who ranged in seniority and experience. We identified two main purposes researchers have for using preregistration  in addition to different user roles and adoption barriers. With the ultimate goal of improving the reliability of scientific findings  we suggest opportunities to explicitly support the different aspects of preregistration use based on our findings.
LBW0258: You Can't Go Your Own Way: Social Influences on Travelling Behavior,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Kevin Sanders  KU Leuven David Geerts  KU Leuven,Travel planning is increasingly done using assistive travel planning technologies. These technologies  however  tend to focus on the traveller as an individual  while travelling can often be a social endeavour involving other people. In order to explore the influence of other people on travelling behaviour  nineteen participants from the city of Ghent  Belgium  took part in a diary study and a subsequent interview. Our results show that the social context of certain travelling behaviours can influence the three main components that make up a displacement (i.e. the route  the departure time and the mode of transportation). Additionally  other aspects of the displacement  such as activities during the displacement  can also be influenced by a social travelling context. We propose that travel planning and travel assistance software could benefit from efforts to incorporate the social aspects of travelling into their systems and offer some suggestions.
LBW0259: Hyper Typer: A Serious Game for Measuring Mobile Text Entry Performance in the Wild,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Richard Schlögl  TU Wien Christoph Wimmer  TU Wien Thomas Grechenig  TU Wien,In this paper we introduce Hyper Typer  a serious Android game for collecting text entry performance data on a large scale in an unsupervised manner. Publishing the game on the Google Play Store resulted in a total of 1 917 usable transcribed phrases with 58 829 keystrokes over an eleven-week period. By analyzing the data  we demonstrate the feasibility of the method and give preliminary results regarding the overall performance and error rate of players. Moreover  the collected data allows us to compare two of the most commonly used Android soft-keyboards.
LBW0261: A/P(rivacy) Testing: Assessing Applications for Social and Institutional Privacy,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Oshrat Ayalon  Tel Aviv University Eran Toch  Tel Aviv University,The way information systems are designed has a crucial effect on users' privacy  but users are rarely involved in Privacy-by-Design processes. To bridge this gap  we investigate how User-Centered Design (UCD) methods can be used to improve the privacy of systems' designs. We present the process of developing A/P(rivacy) Testing  a platform that allows designers to compare several privacy designs alternatives  eliciting end-users' privacy perceptions of a tested system or a feature (Figure 1). We describe three online experiments  with 959 participants  in which we created and validated the reliability of a scale for Users' Perceived Systems' Privacy (UPSP)  and used it to compare between privacy designs alternatives by using scenarios and different variants.

Android permissions are currently not sufficient enough to ensure the security of users' sensitive information. For a sufficient permission model it is important to account the target of the outgoing data flow. On the other hand  permission dialogues often contain relevant information  but most of the users generally do not understand the implications or the visualization fails to guide the user attention to it. It is important to empower users by providing applications that show them who can access their private data and who might send this data to the outside. In order to raise user awareness considering Android permissions  we developed HappyPermi  an application that visualizes which user information is accessible by the granted permissions. Our evaluation (n=20) shows that most users are not aware of the sensitive data that their installed applications have access to. Our results suggest how different users feel about accessing their sensitive data when they are aware of its outgoing destinations.
LBW0264: Towards a Graph of (American) Tech Companies: A Prototype Visualization Tool for Research on Technology and Users,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Niel Chah  University of Toronto,A number of large technology companies  or so-called "tech giants"  such as Alphabet/Google  Amazon  Apple  Facebook  and Microsoft  are increasingly dominant in people's daily lives  and critically studied in fields such as Science  Technology and Society (STS) studies  with an emphasis on technology  data  and privacy. This project aims to contribute to research at the intersection of technology and society with a prototype visualization tool that shows the vast spread and scope of these large technology companies. In this paper  a prototype graph visualization of notable American technology companies  their acquisitions  and services is presented. The potential applications and limitations of the visualization tool for research are explored. This is followed by a discussion of applying the visualization tool to research on personal data and privacy concerns and possible extensions. In particular  difficulties of data collection and representation are emphasized.
LBW0265: Engaging Users with Educational Games: The Case of Phishing,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Matt Dixon  Northumbria University Nalin Asanka Gamagedara Arachchilage  University of New South Wales James Nicholson  Northumbria University,Phishing continues to be a difficult problem for individuals and organisations. Educational games and simulations have been increasingly acknowledged as versatile and powerful teaching tools  yet little work has examined how to engage users with these games. We explore this problem by conducting workshops with 9 younger adults and reporting on their expectations for cybersecurity educational games. We find a disconnect between casual and serious gamers  where casual gamers prefer simple games incorporating humour while serious gamers demand a congruent narrative or storyline. Importantly  both demographics agree that educational games should prioritise gameplay over information provision -- i.e. the game should be a game with educational content. We discuss the implications for educational games developers.
LBW0266: Metro-Viz: Black-Box Analysis of Time Series Anomaly Detectors,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Philipp Eichmann  Brown University Franco Solleza  Brown University Junjay Tan  Brown University Nesime Tatbul  Intel Research & Massachusetts Institute of Technology Stan Zdonik  Brown University,Millions of time-based data streams (a.k.a.  time series) are being recorded every day in a wide-range of industrial and scientific domains  from healthcare and finance to autonomous driving. Detecting anomalous behavior in such streams has become a common analysis task for which data scientists employ complex machine learning models. Analyzing the behavior and performance of these models is a challenge on its own. While traditional accuracy metrics (e.g.  precision/recall) are often used in practice to measure and compare the performance of different anomaly detectors  such statistics alone are insufficient to characterize and compare the algorithms in a systematic  human-interpretable way. In this extended abstract  we present Metro-Viz  a visual analysis tool to help data scientists and domain experts reason about commonalities and differences among anomaly detectors  and to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
LBW0267: Using a Game to Explore Notions of Responsibility for Cyber Security in Organisations,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Dorota Filipczuk  University of Southampton Charles Mason  University of Southampton Stephen Snow  University of Southampton,Improving the cyber literacy of employees reduces a company's risk of cyber security breach. Game-based methods are found to be more effective in teaching users how to avoid fraudulent phishing links than traditional learning material such as videos and text. This paper reports on the development of a mobile app designed to improve cyber literacy and provoke users' perceptions of who is responsible for cyber security in organisations. Based on a preliminary trial with 17 participants  we investigated users perceptions of a tongue-in-cheek  provocative cyber security awareness game where users' jobs depend on their aptitude for protecting their organisations' cyber security. Findings suggest that users accepted the high responsibility levelled upon them in the game and that ludic elements hold promise for engagement and increasing users' cyber awareness.

This paper explores two different possibilities of implementing an easy-to-use interface for tactile pattern design on a large number of actuators around the head. Two user studies were conducted in order to iteratively improve the prototype to fit user needs.
LBW2213: Audio-visual AR to Improve Awareness of Hazard Zones Around Robots,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ane San Martín  IK4-TEKNIKER Johan Kildal  IK4-TEKNIKER,Navigating a space populated by fenceless industrial robots while carrying out other tasks can be stressful  as the worker is unsure about when she is invading the area of influence of a robot  which is a hazard zone. Such areas are difficult to estimate and standing in one may have consequences for worker safety and for the productivity of the robot. We investigate the use of multimodal (auditory and/or visual) head-mounted AR displays to warn about entering hazard zones while performing an independent navigation task. As a first step in this research  we report a design-research study (including a user study)  conducted to obtain a visual and an auditory AR display subjectively judged to approach equivalence. The goal is that these designs can serve as the basis for a future modality comparison study.
LBW2214: First Steps Towards Walk-In-Place Locomotion and Haptic Feedback in Virtual Reality for Visually Impaired,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Julian Kreimeier  Nuremberg Institute of Technology Timo Götzelmann  Nuremberg Institute of Technology,This paper presents the first results on a user study in which people with visual impairments (PVI) explored a virtual environment (VE) by walking in a virtual reality (VR) treadmill. As recently suggested  we have now acquired first results from our feasibility study investigating this walk-in-place interaction. This represents a new  more intuitive way of for example virtually exploring unknown spaces in advance. Our prototype consists of off-the-shelf VR components (i.e.  treadmill  headphones  glasses  and controller) providing a simplified white cane simulation and was tested by six visually impaired subjects. Our results indicate that this interaction is yet difficult  but promising and an important step to make VR more and better usable for PVIs. As an impact on the CHI community  we would like to make this research field known to a wider audience by sharing our intermediate results and suggestions for improvements  on some of which we are already working on.
LBW2215: FabAuth: Printed Objects Identification Using Resonant Properties of Their Inner Structures,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yuki Kubo  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Kana Eguchi  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Ryosuke Aoki  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Shigekuni Kondo  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Shozo Azuma  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Takuya Indo  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,We present a method we propose called FabAuth for identifying 3D-printed objects  which utilizes the differences in the resonant properties of such objects. We focus on changing the internal structures of each object made through a 3D printing process to assign a unique resonant property to it even if multiple objects have the same appearance. To identify the objects  the method identifies resonant property differences by using vibration that can pass through 3D-printed objects. The method can be applied even to low-filled 3D-printed objects as long as an acoustic wave can travel through the objects from one sensor to another. To validate the method's feasibility  we conducted a preliminary experiment to confirm whether it can be applied to low-filled 3D-printed objects and found that its average classification accuracy reached 92.2%.
LBW2216: FingMag: Finger Identification Method for Smartwatch,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Keunwoo Park  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Geehyuk Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,Interacting with a smartwatch is difficult owing to its small touchscreen. A general strategy to overcome the limitations of the small screen is to increase the input vocabulary. A popular approach to do this is to distinguish fingers and assign different functions to them. As a finger identification method for a smartwatch  we propose FingMag  a machine-learning-based method that identifies the finger on the screen with the help of a ring. For this identification  the finger's touch position and the magnetic field from a magnet embedded in the ring are used. In an offline evaluation using data collected from 12 participants  we show that FingMag can identify the finger with an accuracy of 96.21% in stationary geomagnetic conditions.
LBW2217: Improving Two-Thumb Touchpad Typing in Virtual Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jeongmin Son  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Sunggeun Ahn  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Sunbum Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Geehyuk Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,Two-Thumb Touchpad Typing (4T) using hand-held controllers is one of the common text entry techniques in Virtual Reality (VR). However  its performance is far below that of two-thumb typing on a smartphone. We explored the possibility of improving its performance focusing on the following two factors: the visual feedback of hovering thumbs and the grip stability of the controllers. We examined the effects of these two factors on the performance of 4T in VR in user experiments. Their results show that hover feedback had a significant main effect on the 4T performance  but grip stability did not. We then investigated the achievable performance of the final 4T design in a longitudinal study  and its results show that users could achieve a typing speed over 30 words per minute after two hours of practice.
LBW2218: Chinese Character Learning System,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yifan Yang  Zhejiang University Leijing Zhou  University of Nottingham Ningbo China Rujian Li  Zhejiang University Hang Yao  Zhejiang University Jialu Song  Zhejiang University Fangtian Ying  Wuhan University of Technology,As the distinctions of formation structure between Chinese and Western languages  learners take more effort in grasping correct formation structure and pronunciation when they are studying Chinese character. Various Chinese character learning systems have already been proposed in order to help the learners recognize the character  but ignore its handwriting and cultural background. We here present a learning system for learners to study Chinese character better. To increase the effectiveness in learning Chinese character  we combine pronunciation and character writing with the integrated use of computer  projector and camera in this design. This system eases the learners to understand the meaning  cultural background and formation structure of character by using the morphological and phonetic animation projection and handwriting instruction. In comparison with screen-writing systems  this system provides a more authentic learning experience for learners through simulating the learning process of writing on real paper. We anticipate our system to be a starting point to explore the instruction in Chinese character in the field of its formation structure  pronunciation and handwriting  and to be used in the classroom or at home in the future.
LBW2219: "It sounds like she is sad": Introducing a Biosensing Prototype that Transforms Emotions into Real-time Music and Facilitates Social Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xi Lu  Indiana University Bloomington Xiaohang Liu  Indiana University Bloomington Erik Stolterman Bergqvist  Indiana University Bloomington,This paper introduces a biosensing prototype that transforms emotions into music  helping people recognize and understand their own feelings and actions and those of other people. This study presents a series of three experiments with 20 participants in four emotional states: happiness  sadness  anger  and neutral state. Their real-time emotions were captured through a wearable probe Audiolize Emotion that detects users' EEG signals  composes data into audio files which are played to users themselves and others. At last  we conducted observations and interviews with participants to explore factors linked with social interaction  users' perceptions of music  and the reflections on the use of audio form for self-expression or communication. We found that Audiolize Emotion prototype triggers communication and self-expression in two ways: building curiosity and supporting communication by extending expression form. Based on the results  we provide future directions to explore the field of emotion and communication further and plan to apply the knowledge into more fields of VR game and accessibility.
LBW2220: Vibrotactile Wristband for Warning and Guiding in Automated Vehicles,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Zhuoluo Ma  Beijing Institute of Technology Yue Liu  Beijing Institute of Technology & Beijing Film Academy Dejiang Ye  Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing Lu Zhao  Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing,In this paper  we introduce a vibrotactile wristband for warning and guiding the driver based on the road condition in automated vehicles. The vibrotactile wristband can receive the command from the host computer in the vehicles via Bluetooth and generate the corresponding vibration patterns with six vibration motors. 3 vibration patterns are designed to guide the driver to the right direction in the artificial driving state and 8 vibration patterns are designed to warn the driver about the problems which the driving support system can't solve in the automatic driving state. Based on tactile illusions  we convert the graphical markers into the vibration patterns to reduce the driver's memory burden and improve the accuracy of recognizing the patterns. In order to evaluate the performance of the vibrotactile wristband  a virtual driving environment is developed and the subject can experience the vibration patterns when he/she drives the virtual vehicle.
LBW2221: Usability of Code Voting Modalities,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Karola Marky  Technische Universität Darmstadt Martin Schmitz  Technische Universität Darmstadt Felix Lange  Technische Universität Darmstadt Max Mühlhäuser  Technische Universität Darmstadt,Internet voting has promising benefits  such as cost reduction  but it also introduces drawbacks: the computer  that is used for voting  learns the voter's choice. Code voting aims to protect the voter's choice by the introduction of voting codes that are listed on paper. To cast a vote  the voters need to provide the voting code belonging to their choice. The additional step influences the usability. We investigate three modalities for entering voting codes: manual  QR-codes and tangibles. The results show that QR-codes offer the best usability while tangibles are perceived as the most novel and fun.
LBW2222: Towards Augmenting IVR Communication with Physiological Sensing Data,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ceenu George  LMU Munich Mariam Hassib  Bundeswehr University of Munich & LMU Munich,Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) does not afford social cues for communication  such as sweaty palms to indicate stress  as users can only see an avatar of their collaborator. Prior work has shown that this data is necessary for successful collaboration  which is why we propose to augment IVR communication by (1) real-time capturing of physiological senses and (2) leveraging the unlimited virtual space to display these. We present the results of a focus group (N=7) and a preliminary study (N=32) that investigate how this data may be visualized in a playful interaction and the effects they have on the performances of the collaborators.
LBW2310: Byte.it: Discreet Teeth Gestures for Mobile Device Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tomás Vega Gálvez  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Shardul Sapkota  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Alexandru Dancu  Singapore University of Design Pattie Maes  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Byte.it is an exploration of the feasibility of using miniaturized  discreet hardware for teeth-clicking as hands-free input for wearable computing. Prior work has been able to identify teeth-clicking of different teeth groups. Byte.it expands on this work by exploring the use of a smaller and more discreetly positioned sensor suite (accelerometer and gyroscope) for detecting four different teeth-clicks for everyday human-computer interaction. Initial results show that an unobtrusive position on the lower mastoid and mandibular condyle can be used to classify teeth-clicking of four different teeth groups with an accuracy of 89%.
LBW2311: Alexa  Can You Help Us Solve This Problem? How Conversations With Smart Personal Assistant Tutors Increase Task Group Outcomes,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Rainer Winkler  University of St. Gallen Matthias Söllner  University of St. Gallen & University of Kassel Maya Lisa Neuweiler  University of St. Gallen Flavia Conti Rossini  University of St. Gallen Jan Marco Leimeister  University of St. Gallen,Despite a growing body of research about the design and use of Smart Personal Assistants  existing work has mainly focused on their use as task support for individual users in rather simple problem scenarios. Less is known about their ability to improve collaboration among multiple users in more complex problem settings. In our study  we directly compare 21 groups who either use a Smart Personal Assistant tutor or a human tutor when solving a problem task. The results indicate that groups interacting with Smart Personal Assistant tutors show significantly higher task outcomes and higher degrees of collaboration quality compared to groups interacting with human tutors. The results are used to suggest areas for future research in the field of computer-supported collaboration.
LBW2312: "Watch Out!": Semi-Autonomous Vehicles Using Assertive Voices to Grab Distracted Drivers' Attention,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Priscilla N. Y. Wong  UCL Interaction Centre Duncan P. Brumby  University College London Harsha Vardhan Ramesh Babu  ustwo Kota Kobayashi  ustwo,Semi-autonomous vehicles are gradually appearing on our roads  and have already been involved in several high-profile accidents. These accidents usually occurred because the driver did not intervene in time when the automated system failed. An important issue for the design of future semi-autonomous vehicles is identifying effective methods for alerting drivers to critical events that require their intervention. To investigate this  we report the results of a lab-based simulator study in which participants had to respond to driving events while also playing an immersive mobile game on a phone. Results show that a more assertive voice alerting the driver to driving events resulted in faster reaction times and was perceived as more urgent than a less assertive voice  regardless of how immersed the driver was in the mobile game. These results suggest that the designers of future semi-autonomous vehicles should use assertive voice commends to alert drivers to critical events that require their intervention.
LBW2313: Bubble: Wearable Assistive Grasping Augmentation Based on Soft Inflatables,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xinlei Zhang  The University of Tokyo & Massachusetts Institute of Technology Ali Shtarbanov  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Jiani Zeng  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Valerie K. Chen  Massachusetts Institute of Technology V. Michael Bove  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Pattie Maes  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Jun Rekimoto  The University of Tokyo,We present Bubble  a pneumatically actuated wearable device that enables people with hand disabilities to use their own hands to grasp objects without fully bending their fingers. Bubble offers a novel approach to grasping  where slim  ultra-lightweight silicone actuators are attached to the fingers. When the user wishes to grasp an object  the silicone units inflate pneumatically to fill the available space around the object. The inflatable units are interchangeable  can be independently inflated  and can be positioned anywhere on the fingers in any orientation  thereby enabling a wide variety of grasping gestures including the palmar grasp  pinch  etc. In this paper  we describe the implementation of our current prototype  the fabrication process of the soft inflatable units  as well as our preliminary study to evaluate our system's grasping capability.
LBW2314: Design and Evaluation of a Texture Rendering Method for Electrostatic Tactile Display,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lu Zhao  Beijing Institute of Technology Yue Liu  Beijing Institute of Technology & Beijing Film Academy Zhuoluo Ma  Beijing Institute of Technology Yongtian Wang  Beijing Institute of Technology & Beijing Film Academy,Experiencing a sense of touching the displayed objects is the common goal of researchers and users. In this paper  a new texture rendering method for electrostatic tactile display is proposed  through which lateral force to the moving finger is calculated and generated by electrostatic attraction force based on the recorded data such as acceleration signals and friction properties of actual materials. The electrostatic attraction force is adjusted according to the exploring speeds of user's finger. User studies of adjective and similarity ratings on roughness and stickiness of virtual materials are designed  and the results demonstrate that the sense of touching the rendered materials is similar to that of the real materials  which proves that the proposed texture rendering method can be applied to display tactile information in an electrostatic tactile display.
LBW2315: Cognitive Aid: Task Assistance Based On Mental Workload Estimation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Qiushi Zhou  University of Melbourne Joshua Newn  University of Melbourne Namrata Srivastava  University of Melbourne Tilman Dingler  University of Melbourne Jorge Goncalves  University of Melbourne Eduardo Velloso  University of Melbourne,In this work  we evaluate the potential of using wearable non-contact (infrared) thermal sensors through a user study (N=12) to measure mental workload. Our results indicate the possibility of mental workload estimation through the temperature changes detected using the prototype as participants perform two task variants with increasing difficulty levels. While the sensor accuracy and the design of the prototype can be further improved  the prototype showed the potential of building AR-based systems with cognitive aid technology for ubiquitous task assistance from the changes in mental workload demands. As such  we demonstrate our next steps by integrating our prototype into an existing AR headset (i.e. Microsoft HoloLens).
LBW2316: An Exploratory Study for Evaluating the Use of Floor Visualisations in Navigation Decisions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Luluah Albarrak  University of Bristol Oussama Metatla  University of Bristol Anne Roudaut  University of Bristol,Different environmental cues can influence our spatial behaviour when we explore unfamiliar spaces. Research shows that the presence of other people affects our navigation decisions. To investigate the use of this environmental cue as a navigation aid in novel environment  we first explore visualisations that represent historical presence of people. We carried out an exploratory study (n=12) to examine whether and how people understand and use floor visualisations to make their navigational choices. Results suggest that floor visualisations have influenced participants' navigation decisions. Our findings showed that implicit visualisations were difficult to interpret compared to explicit visualisations. Thematic analysis of participants' interpretations revealed a contextual interpretation of explicit visualisations and non-contextual interpretation of implicit visualisations. Additionally  thematic analysis revealed that spatial behaviour is influenced by several factors including self-centredness  environmental features and the presence of others. These design insights will inform the design of history-enriched floor interfaces that direct people in the built environment.
LBW2317: The Challenges of Creating Engaging Content: Results from a Focus Group Study of a Popular News Media Organization,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Kholoud Khalil Aldous  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Jisun An  Qatar Computing Research Institute & Hamad Bin Khalifa University Bernard J. Jansen  Qatar Computing Research Institute & Hamad Bin Khalifa University,The process of content creation for distribution via social media platforms is not a trivial one for social media editors as the goal of creating both serious and engaging content is challenging  with no clear or differing guidelines or rules across and between platforms. For creators of serious content  such as news organizations  advertisers  or educational institutions  engagement has a deeper meaning beyond likes  shares  etc. that is aimed at the audience actually processing the underlying content associated with a social media post. In this research  we report findings from a group study that aimed to understand the process and challenges of creating engaging content across three social media platforms in a major news organization. The findings from the study indicate that creating engaging content is effort- and time-consuming  and they highlight the need to support the process of creating engaging content across multiple social media platforms. Our longer-term goal is to develop a system design to support social media editors' creation of engaging content with which they can select engaging passages from news articles and select platforms on which to publish the content.
LBW2319: Navigating Uncertainty in the Future of Work: Information-Seeking and Critical Events Among Online Freelancers,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Allie Blaising  California Polytechnic University Yasmine Kotturi  Carnegie Mellon University Chinmay Kulkarni  Carnegie Mellon University,Online freelancer marketplaces offer workers the flexibility and control they desire. However  workers also struggle with the uncertainty resulting from these benefits. In traditional brick-and-mortar workplaces  workers who experience uncertainty during specific phases of their assimilation into a new role or organization engage in information-seeking behaviors. Understanding these phases of heightened uncertainty helps organizations better cater to workers' informational needs e.g. through mentorship programs. While understanding the uncertainty that online workers experience as they assimilate into their career is critical to understanding online workers' needs  such an understanding is currently severely limited. thus  we conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 online freelancers to investigate critical events that contribute to uncertainty early in their online careers. We situate these critical events within the context of organizational assimilation  and how participants employ diverse information-seeking tactics.
LBW2320: Human-Data Interaction in the Context of Care: Co-designing Family Civic Data Interfaces and Practices,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alex Bowyer  Newcastle University Rob Wilson  Northumbria University Stuart Wheater  Arjuna Technologies Matthew Snape  Newcastle University Kyle Montague  Newcastle University,By storing data about citizens for the purposes of service provision  private and public organizations have disempowered the people they serve  shifting the balance of power toward themselves as data holders. Through three co-production engagements involving families receiving "early help" support from their local authority and support workers involved in supplying this care  we have identified existing data usage practices  explored the impact of those practices upon the supported families  and co-designed new and improved approaches – both technological and practice-based – that are perceived to offer families fairer treatment  greater influence  and to benefit from better decision-making. Our findings show that by applying Human-Data Interaction and giving supported families direct access to see and manipulate their own data  both during and outside of the support engagement  the locus of decision-making could be shifted towards the data subject.
LBW2321: Affective Assistants: A Matter of States and Traits,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Michael Braun  BMW Group Research & LMU Munich Florian Alt  Bundeswehr University Munich,This work presents a model for the development of affective assistants based on the pillars of user states and traits. Traits are defined as long-term qualities like personality  personal experiences  preferences  and demographics  while the user state comprises cognitive load  emotional states  and physiological parameters. We discuss useful input values and the necessary developments for an advancement of affective assistants with the example of an affective in-car voice assistant. With our work we help to shape the vision of our community regarding affective interfaces  not just in the automotive domain but also for other application areas.
LBW2322: Implicit User Calibration for Model-based Gaze-tracking System using Face Detection around Optical Axis of Eye,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mamoru Hiroe  Kobe University Shogo Mitsunaga  Kobe University Takashi Nagamatsu  Kobe University,In recent studies of gaze tracking system using 3D model-based methods  the optical axis of the eye is estimated without user calibration. The remaining problem for achieving implicit user calibration is to estimate the difference between the optical axis and visual axis of the eye (angle kappa). In this paper  we propose an implicit user calibration method using face detection around the optical axis of the eye. We assume that the peak of the average of face region images indicates the visual axis of the eye in the eye coordinate system. The angle kappa is estimated as the difference between the optical axis of the eye and the peak of the average of face region images. We developed a prototype system with two cameras and two IR-LEDs. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can estimate the angle kappa more accurately than the method that uses Itti's saliency map instead of face detection.
LBW2410: "I Have a Life": Teacher Communication & Management Outside the Classroom,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Serena Hillman  SMART Technologies Alexandra Hillman  SMART Technologies Carman Neustaedter  Simon Fraser University Carolyn Pang  McGill University,Over the past decade  there has been an increase in educational software use within classrooms as well as continuing demand on K-12 teachers extending beyond in-class activities. Yet  we still do not have a deep understanding of current teacher behaviors outside the classroom. Our paper presents insights on how to better design for technology use in this space by reporting on key themes such as communication  privacy and student technology at home. These findings translate into design implications to increase transparency with student data  the need to design first for technology students have access to in the home (e.g. mobile) and designing for the teacher need of setting personal boundaries within communication tools.
LBW2411: Modeling Error Rates in Spatiotemporal Moving Target Selection,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jin Huang  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences Byungjoo Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,When we try to acquire a moving target such as hitting a virtual tennis in a computer game  we must hit the target instantly when it flies over our hitting range. In other words  we have to acquire the target in spatial and temporal domains simultaneously. We call this type of task spatiotemporal moving target selection  which we find is common yet less studied in HCI. This paper presents a tentative model for predicting the error rates in spatiotemporal moving target selection. Our model integrates two latest models  the Ternary-Gaussian model and the Temporal Pointing model  to explain the influence of spatial and temporal constraints on pointing errors. In a 12-subject pointing experiment with a computer mouse  our model shows high fitting results with 0.904 R2. We discuss future research directions on this topic and how it could potentially help the design in dynamical user interfaces.
LBW2412: Trajectory Prediction Model for Crossing-Based Target Selection,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hao Zhang  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences Jin Huang  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences Feng Tian  Institute of software  Chinese Academy of Sciences,In some cases  crossing-based target selection motion may gain a less error rates and a higher interactive speed. Most of the research in target selection fields focused on the analysis of interaction results. Moreover  trajectories play a much more important role in crossing-based target selection comparing to the other interactive techniques. And an ideal model for trajectories may help computer designers make predictions about interaction results during the process of target selection rather than at the end of the whole process. We proposed a trajectory prediction model for crossing-based target selection tasks referring to dynamic model theory. Simulation results show that our model performed well in the prediction of the trajectories  endpoints and the hitting time for target-selection motion  and the average error of trajectories  endpoints and hitting time values as 17.28%  18.17 pixel and 11.50%.
LBW2413: It Sounds Like A Woman: Exploring Gender Stereotypes in South Korean Voice Assistants,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Gilhwan Hwang  Seoul National University Jeewon Lee  Seoul National University Cindy Yoonjung Oh  Seoul National University Joonhwan Lee  Seoul National University,For the past few years  voice assistant (VA) has been widely used around the world. Current voice assistants provide a gendered voice to sound more natural and life-like  but most of them have a female voice as a default voice setting. Our study explored how gender stereotypes of women are reflected in voice assistants with female voices through analyzing five South Korean VAs. We collected 1 602 responses from VAs and conducted a thematic analysis to examine the patterns of the gender stereotype. As a result  we have categorized three distinct characteristics: (1) bodily display  (2) subordinate attitude  (3) sexualization. We suggested that these stereotypical traits could create a power dynamic between users and female agents.
LBW2414: Is Seeing Believing? The Effect of Morphological Congruent Visual Feedback on Mediated Touch Experience,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sima Ipakchian Askari  Eindhoven University of Technology Antal Haans  Eindhoven University of Technology Wijnand A. IJsselsteijn  Eindhoven University of Technology,Mediated social touch (MST) provides physical contact over a distance for geographically separated individuals. Despite advances in actuator technologies  it remains difficult to recreate the feel and sensation of natural human touch. Combining touch with morphologically congruent visual feedback may overcome limitations related to the low fidelity of current-day tactile displays. Being able to both feel and see the touch act being initiated on an input device could enhance the perceived realism of the touches. In two studies  we test the effects of such visual feedback on self-reported naturalness of touch  social presence  and emotional experiences.
LBW2415: Personal Safety App Effectiveness,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mike Just  Heriot-Watt University Hasmeet Chandok  Dalhousie University Raghav Sampangi  Dalhousie University Kirstie Hawkey  Dalhousie University Alette Willis  University of Edinburgh JeyaBalaji Samuthiravelu  Dalhousie University Dilpreet Gill  Dalhousie University Michael Altair  Dalhousie University,We present the results of our study of people's responses to unsafe scenarios with personal safety apps. Several such apps have been developed  offering features such as a location-sharing panic button. However  there is little research into how people might respond in different personal safety situations  and how such apps might contribute to their response. We performed a lab study with 30 participants and used semi-structured interviews to gather responses to a set of three increasingly risky scenarios  both before and after the installation of a personal safety app. From our results  participants stated that they would use mobile phones and personal safety apps most often to support "collective" responses  with calls to others for assistance. Further  while collective responses were often combined with "avoidance" or "protective" responses  when using a personal safety app  collective responses were less often combined with other reaction types. Overall  our results suggest some potential benefit from personal safety apps  though more study is required.
LBW2416: Perception of Emotion in Body Expressions from Gaze Behavior,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Andrea Kleinsmith  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Azin Semsar  University of Maryland  Baltimore County,Developing affectively aware technologies is a growing industry. To build them effectively  it is important to understand the features involved in discriminating between emotions. While many technologies focus on facial expressions  studies have highlighted the influence of body expressions over other modalities for perceiving some emotions. Eye tracking studies have evaluated the combination of face and body to investigate the influence of each modality  however  few to none have investigated the perception of emotion from body expressions alone. This exploratory study aimed to evaluate the discriminative importance of dynamic body features for decoding emotion. Eye tracking was used to monitor participants' eye gaze behavior while viewing clips of non-acted body movements to which they associated an emotion. Preliminary results indicate that the two primary regions attended to most often and longest were the torso and the arms. Further analysis is ongoing  however initial results independently confirm prior studies without eye tracking.
LBW2417: Public Speaking Anxiety in a Real Classroom: Towards Developing a Reflection System,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Heera Lee  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Andrea Kleinsmith  University of Maryland  Baltimore County,Public speaking is recognized as an important skill for success in learning and education. However  the mere thought of public speaking elicits anxiety in many people. This anxiety may manifest in a student's nonverbal behaviors and physiological responses which can negatively affect both performance and evaluation. While public speaking training systems have employed a variety of speaker cues to automatically evaluate and score public speaking performance  many are built on data collected in a lab setting. However  it is difficult to achieve the same level of anxiety in these environments. We posit that students would benefit from a system that provides the ability to reflect on and practice public speaking presentation skills. This preliminary study explores public speaking anxiety from physiological responses and nonverbal behaviors of English language learners in-situ as a first step toward the design and development of a public speaking practice and reflection system.
LBW2418: (Over)Trust in Automated Driving: The Sleeping Pill of Tomorrow?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Thomas Kundinger  AUDI AG & Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt Philipp Wintersberger  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University Andreas Riener  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University,Both overtrust in technology and drowsy driving are safety-critical issues. Monitoring a system is a tedious task and overtrust in technology might also influence drivers' vigilance  what in turn could multiply the negative impact of both issues. The aim of this study was to investigate if trust in automation affects drowsiness. 30 participants in two age groups conducted a 45-minute ride in a level-2 vehicle on a real test track. Trust was assessed before and after the ride with a subjective trust scale. Drowsiness was captured during the experiment using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Results depict  that even a short initial system exposure significantly increases trust in automated driving. Drivers who trust the automated vehicles more show larger signs of drowsiness what may negatively impact the monitoring behavior. Drowsiness detection is important for automated vehicles  and the behavior of drowsy drivers might help to infer trust in an unobtrusively way.
LBW2419: Infrastructure vs. Community: Co-spaces Confront Digital Nomads' Paradoxical Needs,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ahreum Lee  Purdue University Austin L. Toombs  Purdue University Ingrid Erickson  Syracuse University,Co-working and co-living companies are rising globally and the increasing participation within the gig economy has extended the range of users of community-based spaces (co-spaces) and raised a set of different community models in considering how to support them. In this paper  we specifically focus on the needs of digital nomads in co-spaces who struggle to pursue their personal and professional freedom. In so doing  we raise awareness of existing tensions that currently hinder the social engagement of these individuals in co-space settings.
LBW2420: Cognitive Learning: How to Become William Shakespeare,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xiaotong Liu  IBM Research - Almaden Anbang Xu  IBM Research - Almaden Zhe Liu  IBM Almaden Research Center Yufan Guo  IBM Research - Almaden Rama Akkiraju  IBM Research - Almaden,Writing is a fundamental task in our daily life. Existing writing improvement tools mostly focus on low-level grammar error correction  rather than enhancing users' writing styles at the cognitive level. In this work  we present a computational approach that allows learners to have fast but effective learning experience with the help of automatic style transfer  visual stylometry analytics  machine teaching and practice. Our system provides a perfect fusion of vividly visualized style features and principles along with informative examples  which together can shape and drive personalized cognitive learning experience. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in a scenario of learning from William Shakespeare.
LBW2421: The Helpless Soft Robot - Stimulating Human Collaboration through Robotic Movement,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anna Dagmar Bille Milthers  Aalborg University Anne Bjerre Hammer  Aalborg University Jonathan Jung Johansen  Aalborg University Lasse Goul Jensen  Aalborg University Elizabeth Ann Jochum  Aalborg University Markus Löchtefeld  Aalborg University,Soft robotics have a set of unique traits  such as excelling at grabbing fragile objects which stem from the highly compliant materials used to produce them. However  very little research has so far focused on the interplay of the different interaction partners in a human - soft-robot collaboration. In this paper  we present the results of our investigation of the influence of two movement patterns on the willingness of random passersby to assist a soft robot in completing a task.
LBW2422: Should an Agent Be Ignoring It? A Study of Verbal Abuse Types and Conversational Agents' Response Styles,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hyojin Chin  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Mun Yong Yi  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,Verbal abuse is a hostile form of communication ill-intended to harm the other person. With a plethora of AI solutions around  the other person being targeted may be a conversational agent. In this study  involving 3 verbal abuse types (Insult  Threat  Swearing) and 3 response styles (Avoidance  Empathy  Counterattacking)  we examine whether a conversational agent's response style under varying abuse types influences those emotions found to mitigate people's aggressive behaviors. Sixty-four participants  assigned to one of the abuse type conditions  interacted with the three conversational agents in turn and reported their feelings about guiltiness  anger  and shame after each session. Our study results show that  regardless of the abuse type  the agent's response style has a significant effect on user emotions. Participants were less angry and more guilty with the empathetic agent than the other two agents. Our study findings have direct implications for the design of conversational agents.
LBW2510: A Gaze-Based Exploratory Study on the Information Seeking Behavior of Developers on Stack Overflow,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Cole S. Peterson  University of Nebraska - Lincoln Jonathan A. Saddler  University of Nebraska - Lincoln Natalie M. Halavick  Purdue University Bonita Sharif  University of Nebraska - Lincoln,Software developers use Stack Overflow on a daily basis to search for solutions to problems they encounter during bug fixing and feature enhancement. In prior work  studies have been done on mining Stack Overflow data such as for predicting unanswered questions or how and why people post. However  no work exists on how developers actually use  or more importantly  read the information presented to them on Stack Overflow. To better understand this behavior  we conduct an eye tracking study on how developers seek for information on Stack Overflow while tasked with creating human-readable summaries of methods and classes in large Java projects. Eye gaze data is collected on both the source code elements and Stack Overflow document elements at a fine token-level granularity using iTrace  our eye tracking infrastructure. We found that developers look at the text more often than the title in posts. Code snippets were the second most looked at element. Tags and votes are rarely looked at. When switching between Stack Overflow and the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE)  developers often looked at method signatures and then switched to code and text elements on Stack Overflow. Such heuristics provide insight to automated code summarization tools as they decide what to give more weight to while generating summaries.
LBW2511: Supporting Data Workers To Perform Exploratory Programming,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Krishna Subramanian  RWTH Aachen University Ilya Zubarev  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,Data science is an open-ended task in whichexploratory programming is a common practice. Data workers often need faster and easier ways to explore alternative approaches to obtain insights from data  which frequently compromises code quality. To understand how well current IDEs support this exploratory workflow  we conducted an observational study with 19 data workers. In this paper  we present two significant findings from our analysis that highlight issues faced by data workers: (a)code hoarding and (b) excessivetask switching andcode cloning. To mitigate these issues  we provide design recommendations based on existing work  and propose to augment IDEs with an interactive visual plugin. This plugin parses source code to identify and visualize high-level task details. Data workers can use the resulting visualization to better understand and navigate the source code. As a realization of this idea  we presentAddIn  an add-in for RStudio that identifies and visualizes the hypotheses that a data worker is testing for statistical significance through her source code.
LBW2512: Where in the Cloud is my Data? Location and Brand Effects on Trust in Cloud Services,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,S. Shyam Sundar  Penn State University Jinyoung Kim  Penn State University Eugene Cho  Penn State University,We all hold stereotypes about different locations across the world. Do these stereotypes affect our attitudes toward cloud services when we are told the location of the servers storing our data? And  does it matter if the cloud services are provided by a well-known brand? To answer these questions  a 2 X 11 experiment was conducted to examine the effects of location and brand cues on users' reaction to cloud services. Brand authority of the hosting company had a positive effect. More importantly  location of the cloud servers also affected outcomes  in that users tended to prefer some locations (e.g.  US  Europe  Oceania  China) over others (e.g.  Russia) for storing their cloud data. These findings have theoretical implications as well as design suggestions.
LBW2513: Acceptance of Self-Driving Cars: Does Their Posthuman Ability Make Them More Eerie or More Desirable?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Andrew Gambino  Penn State University S. Shyam Sundar  Penn State University,The arrival of self-driving cars and smart technologies is fraught with controversy  as users hesitate to cede control to machines for vital tasks. While advances in engineering have made such autonomous technology a reality  considerable design work is needed to motivate their mass adoption. What are the key predictors of people's acceptance of self-driving cars? Is it the ease of use or coolness aspect? Is it the degree of perceived control for users? We decided to find out with a survey (N = 404) assessing acceptance of self-driving cars  and discovered that the strongest predictor is "posthuman ability " suggesting that individuals are much more accepting of technology that can clearly outclass human abilities.
LBW2514: Configuring Personal Data for a Quantified-Self Archive,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ciaran B. Trace  University of Texas at Austin Yan Zhang  University of Texas at Austin,An audience exists for personal information  including quantified-self data  beyond an individual's social network and social communities. In the era of big data  the research and policy arenas are two areas where up-to-date assemblages of personal information have market value. In this ongoing study  we examine the long-term value of small data [2]  acknowledging that there is also a societal need and an audience for rich  personalized collections of digital self-tracking records. Using qualitative research methods  we interviewed 18 people to explore the nature of self-tracking data that exists as a byproduct of daily life  and their sense of why and how their data could be archived for posterity. In the process  the intellectual and design challenges of a digital quantified-self archive are explored.
LBW2515: Towards a Typology of Self-Tracking Gaps,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ciaran B. Trace  University of Texas at Austin Yan Zhang  University of Texas at Austin,This paper introduces an emerging typology of the 'absences' that confound the study of self-tracking. A review of the literature  and the ongoing work of the authors on the long-term value of self-tracking data  is used as a resource to develop descriptions of levels and types of 'gaps' that emerge as part of the activities  behaviors  technologies  and data practices of self-tracking. Such gaps are shown to be both common and insightful  highlighting the economic  social  behavioral  and psychological layers that undergird self-tracking.
LBW2516: Information-theoretic Sensorimotor Foundations of Fitts' Law,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Dari Trendafilov  Johannes Kepler University Daniel Polani  University of Hertfordshire,We propose a novel  biologically plausible cost/fitness function for sensorimotor control  formalized with the information-theoretic principle of empowerment  a task-independent universal utility. Empowerment captures uncertainty in the perception-action loop of different nature (e.g. noise  delays  etc.) in a single quantity. We present the formalism in a Fitts' law type goal-directed arm movement task and suggest that empowerment is one potential underlying determinant of movement trajectory planning in the presence of signal-dependent sensorimotor noise. Simulation results demonstrate the temporal relation of empowerment and various plausible control strategies for this specific task.
LBW2517: Discovering Users for Technical Innovations through Systematic Matchmaking,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Bart van Dijk  Eindhoven University of Technology John Zimmerman  Carnegie Mellon University,Every year Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers create new technical innovations. Unfortunately  the User-Centered Design (UCD) processes used by most designers in HCI does not help much when the challenge is to find the best users for these innovations. We augmented the matchmaking design method  making it more systematic in considering potential users by using a list of 399 occupation groups and by incorporating the customer discovery interviews from the Lean Startup. We then assessed our new design method by searching for users who might benefit from two different technical innovations: ViBand and PaperID. We found that matchmaking with the list of occupation groups helped surface users we would likely have not considered. In addition  the customer discovery interviews helped to generate better applications and additional target users for the innovations. This paper documents our process  the design method  and insights we gained from using it.
LBW2518: Using Reinforced Implementation Intentions to Support Habit Formation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Adhi Wicaksono  University of Birmingham Robert J. Hendley  University of Birmingham Russell Beale  University of Birmingham,Despite promising results  the psychological approach of implementation intentions remain underused in 'in-the-wild' habit formation apps. The majority of existing apps focus on using self-tracking and reminders but these hinder the development of habit. This study proposes a new mechanism to support habit formation by using reinforced implementation intentions. Our findings suggest that adding reinforcement is indeed useful to maintain the level of compliance but it is not necessarily the same in terms of automaticity. We also discuss how the potential use of reinforcement can be improved in the future.
LBW2519: Modeling Drone Pointing Movement with Fitts' Law,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Kaito Yamada  Meiji University Hiroki Usuba  Meiji University Homei Miyahita  Meiji University,Although numerous studies have focused on interfaces for maneuvering drones  a method for evaluating these interfaces has not been established. A pointing experiment was carried out with a drone in this study. The results indicate that the target distance and target width affect the movement time and error rate while maneuvering. This is consistent with the results of previous pointing studies. Fitts' law was not a good fit (R^2 = 0.672)  while the data fit well to a two-part model (R^2 = 0.993). Based on these results  we propose future experimental work that could contribute to improving drone interfaces.
LBW2520: Using Screenshots to Predict Task Switching on Smartphones,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xiao Yang  Pennsylvania State University Nilam Ram  Pennsylvania State University Thomas Robinson  Stanford University Byron Reeves  Stanford University,Mobile phone use is pervasive  yet little is known about task switching on digital platforms and applications. We propose an unobtrusive experience sampling method to observe how individuals use their smartphones by taking screenshots every 5 seconds when the device is on. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate the psychological process into feature extraction  and use these features to effectively predict the task switching behavior on smartphones. Features are extracted from the sequence of screenshots  gauging visual stimulation  cognitive load  velocity and accumulation  sentiment  and time-related factors. Labels of task switching behavior were manually tagged for 87 182 screenshots from 60 subjects. Using random forest  we demonstrate that we can correctly infer a user's task switching behavior from unstructured data in screenshots with up to 77% accuracy  demonstrating it is a viable option to use features of the screenshots to predict task switching behavior.
LBW2521: Understanding Social Costs in Online Question Asking,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Haiwei Ma  University of Minnesota Bowen Yu  University of Minnesota Hao Fei Cheng  GroupLens Research Haiyi Zhu  University of Minnesota,Various social media sites and online communities provide new channels for people in need to ask questions and seek help. However  individuals may still encounter psychological barriers that deter solicitation for assistance  which is more formally described as \textit{''social costs''}. For example  it can be %concerns people have when seeking help can be the concerns of burdening others  the obligation of reciprocation  etc. To understand what could reduce social costs  we conducted a study in the context of Question-Answering (QA) and investigated the following three factors inspired by literature: anonymity (posting a question anonymously)  recommendation (having the system handle the question routing)  and ephemerality (allowing questions to be visible only for a short period). We built a QA platform to support these three features and conducted a randomized within-subject experiment to test their effects on social costs of posting questions. Results suggest the presence of anonymity  recommendation  and ephemerality reduces the social costs which provides design implications for future community building.
LBW2522: fNIRS and Neurocinematics,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Horia A. Maior  University of Nottingham Richard Ramchurn  The University of Nottingham Sarah Martindale  University of Nottingham Ming Cai  The University of Nottingham Max L. Wilson  University of Nottingham Steve Benford  University of Nottingham,In the overlap between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Cinematics  sits an interest in physiological responses to experiences. Focusing particularly on brain data  Neurocinematics has emerged as a research field using Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensors. Where previous work found inter subject correlations (ISC) between brain measurements of people watching movies in constrained conditions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  we seek to examine similar responses in more naturalistic settings using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS has been shown to be highly suitable for HCI studies  being more portable than fMRI and more tolerant of many natural movements than Electroencephalography (EEG). Early results found significant ISC  which gives a lot of hope and potential for using fNIRS in Neurocinematics.
LBW2610: Tell Me What You Know: GDPR Implications on Designing Transparency and Accountability for News Recommender Systems,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Luciana Monteiro Krebs  UFRGS & Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Oscar Luis Alvarado Rodriguez  KU Leuven Pierre Dewitte  KU Leuven Jef Ausloos  University of Amsterdam David Geerts  KU Leuven Laurens Naudts  KU Leuven Katrien Verbert  KU Leuven,The GDPR has a significant impact on the way users interact with technologies  especially the everyday platforms used to personalize news and related forms of information. This paper presents the initial results from a study whose primary objective is to empirically test those platforms' level of compliance with the so-called 'right to explanation'. Four research topics considered as gaps in existing legal and HCI scholarship originated from the project's initial phase  namely (1) GDPR compliance through user-centered design; (2) the inclusion of values in the system; (3) design considerations regarding interaction strategies  algorithmic experience  transparency  and explanations; and (4) technical challenges. The second phase is currently ongoing and allows us to make some observations regarding the registration process and the privacy policies of three categories of news actors: first-party content providers  news aggregators and social media platforms.
LBW2611: "Woe is me": Examining Older Adults' Perceptions of Privacy,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hirak Ray  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Flynn Wolf  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Ravi Kuber  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Adam J. Aviv  United States Naval Academy,We conducted a study of n = 20 older adults to better understand their mental models for what the term 'privacy' means to them in both digital and non-digital contexts. Participants were asked to diagrammatically represent this information and describe their drawings in a semi-structured interview setting. Preliminary coding analysis revealed participants' frustrations with available methods for addressing privacy violations. While some asserted that there are both good and bad uses of private data  others avoided technology as a whole out of privacy fears or ambivalence towards using web-based banking and social media services. Some participants described fighting back against privacy attacks  while others felt resigned altogether. Our study provides initial steps towards illuminating privacy perceptions of older adults and can have impacts on training and tailor design for this important demographic.
LBW2612: Security Patterns for Webdesign: a Hierarchical Structure Approach,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alexander G. Mirnig  University of Salzburg Artur Lupp  University of Salzburg Alexander Meschtscherjakov  University of Salzburg Eleni Economidou  University of Salzburg Manfred Tscheligi  University of Salzburg & AIT,In today's age  a wide range of individuals create their own web presence. Thanks to modern tools  creating a website is easier than ever. In order to make sure that this increased accessibility does not come at the cost of decreased security  the respective web design knowledge should become more accessible as well. We created 16 security patterns for web design based on expert knowledge. We present the solution hierarchy of these patterns and how they might be applied by non-expert users.
LBW2613: Towards Better Security Decisions: Applying Prospect Theory to Cybersecurity,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Leilei Qu  Renmin University of China Cheng Wang  Renmin University of China Ruojin Xiao  Renmin University of China Jianwei Hou  Renmin University of China Wenchang Shi  Renmin University of China Bin Liang  Renmin University of China,Normal users are usually not good at making decisions about cybersecurity  being easily attacked by hackers. Quite a few tools have been devised and implemented to help  but they can not balance security and usability well. To solve the problem  this paper explores the application of prospect theory to security recommendations. We conducted online surveys (n=61) and a between-subjects experiment (n=106) in six conditions to investigate the issues. In the experiment  we provided different security recommendations about two-factor-authentication (2FA) to participants in different conditions and recorded their decisions about enabling it. Results show that participants in the condition "Disadvantage" were willing to adopt 2FA the most. The findings indicate that showing disadvantages can be useful to persuade users into better security decisions.
LBW2614: UltraSonic Watch: Seamless Two-Factor Authentication through Ultrasound,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Dimitra Zarafeta  University of Patras Christina Katsini  University of Patras & Human Opsis George E. Raptis  University of Patras & Human Opsis Nikolaos Avouris  University of Patras,Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security as it requires two pieces of evidence to be provided to an authentication mechanism before granting access to a user. However  people do not prefer 2FA; a reason for this is that 2FA requires performing extra actions. In this late-breaking work  we present UltraSonic Watch which provides a seamless 2FA through ultrasound. We report a small-scale within-subjects study (N=30) which investigates the performance of UltraSonic Watch and the participants' experience (in terms of perception  preference  and willingness to adopt). The results are promising as they revealed that ultrasound can be used to provide an efficient 2FA mechanism  transparent to the users  who are positive in adopting such an approach to increase the security of the authentication process.
LBW2615: VRIA - A Framework for Immersive Analytics on the Web,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Peter W. S. Butcher  University of Chester Nigel W. John  University Of Chester Panagiotis D. Ritsos  Bangor University,We report on the design  implementation and evaluation of VRIA  a framework for building immersive analytics (IA) solutions in Web-based Virtual Reality (VR)  built upon WebVR  A-Frame  React and D3. The recent emergence of affordable VR interfaces have reignited the interest of researchers and developers in exploring new  immersive ways to visualize data. In particular  the use of open-standards web-based technologies for implementing VR in a browser facilitates the ubiquitous and platform-independent adoption of IA systems. Moreover  such technologies work in synergy with established visualization libraries  through the HTML document object model (DOM). We discuss high-level features of VRIA and present a preliminary user experience evaluation of one of our use cases.
LBW2616: Online Privacy in Public Places: How do Location  Terms and Conditions and VPN Influence Disclosure?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Maria D. Molina  Pennsylvania State University Andrew Gambino  Pennsylvania State University S. Shyam Sundar  Pennsylvania State University,Do we disclose more information online when we access Wi-Fi from home compared to the University  or an Airbnb rental  or a coffee shop? Does it matter if we are shown terms and conditions (T&C) before getting online? Will signing into a virtual private network (VPN) affect our disclosure? We conducted an experiment (N = 276) to find out. Our results suggest that while VPN promotes disclosure of personal information and unethical behaviors in an Airbnb network  the provision of T&C inhibits this disclosure. Conversely  in a University network  provision of terms and conditions encourages disclosure of unethical behavior  but the presence of VPN cue inhibits it. Further  a user's belief in the publicness heuristic (public networks are risky) dictate how much users reveal in various locations based on their perceptions of relative security of accessing Wi-Fi from those locations.
LBW2617: Exploring Parallel Coordinates Plots in Virtual Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Slawomir Konrad Tadeja  University of Cambridge Timoleon Kipouros  University of Cambridge Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge,Parallel Coordinates Plots (PCP) are a widely used approach to interactively visualize and analyze multidimensional scientific data in a 2D environment. In this paper  we explore the use of Parallel Coordinates in an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) 3D visualization environment as a means to support the decision-making process in engineering design processes. We evaluate the potential of VR PCP using a formative qualitative study with seven participants. In a task involving 54 points with 29 dimensions per point  we found that participants were able to detect patterns in the dataset compared with a previously published study with two expert users using traditional 2D PCP  which acts as the gold standard for the dataset. The dataset describes the Pareto front for a three-objective aerodynamic design optimization study in turbomachinery.
LBW2618: An Observational Investigation of Reverse Engineers' Process and Mental Models,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Daniel Votipka  University of Maryland Seth Rabin  University of Maryland Kristopher Micinski  Haverford College Jeffrey S. Foster  Tufts University Michelle L. Mazurek  University of Maryland,Reverse engineering is a complex task essential to several software security jobs like vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. While traditional program comprehension tasks (e.g.  program maintenance or debugging) have been thoroughly studied  reverse engineering diverges from these tasks as reverse engineers do not have access to developers  source code  comments  or internal documentation. Further  reverse engineers often have to overcome countermeasures employed by the developer to make the task harder (e.g.  symbol stripping  packing  obfuscation). Significant research effort has gone into providing program analysis tools to support reverse engineers. However  little work has been done to understand the way they think and analyze programs  potentially leading to the lack of adoption of these tools among practitioners. This paper reports on a first step toward better understanding the reverse engineer's process and mental models and provides directions for improving program analysis tools to better fit their users. We present the initial results of a semi-structured  observational interview study of reverse engineers (n=15). Each interview investigated the questions they asked while probing the program  how they answered these questions  and the decisions made throughout. Our initial observations suggest that reverse engineers rely on a variety of reference points in both the program text and structure as well as its dynamic behavior to build hypotheses about the program's function and identify points of interest for future exploration. In most cases  our reverse engineers used a mix of static and dynamic analysis---mostly manually---to verify these hypotheses. Throughout  they rely on intuition built up over past experience. From these observations  we provide recommendations for user interface and program analysis improvements to support the reverse engineer.
LBW2619: Exploring the Impact of Network Impairments on Remote Collaborative Augmented Reality Applications,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tooba Ahsen  Tufts University Fahad R. Dogar  Tufts University Aaron L. Gardony  CCDC - Soldier Center & CABCS,Our research explores the impact of network impairments on remote augmented reality (AR) collaborative tasks  and possible strategies to improve user experience in these scenarios. Using a simple AR task  under a controlled network environment  our preliminary user study highlights the impact of network outages on user workload and experience  and how user roles and learning styles play a role in this regard.
LBW2620: Paired Conversational Agents for Easy-to-Understand Instruction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Wataru Akahori  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Asuka Miyake  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Hiroaki Sugiyama  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Masahiro Watanabe  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Hiroya Minami  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,Conversational agents such as those hosted by the 'smart speakers' have become popular over the last few years. Although users can accomplish tasks as if they were asking a person  users still have problems in utilizing conversational agents effectively. To address this problem  some proposals explain how to input agent requests by using visual information such as instruction manuals and displays. However  such instructions create problems such as occupying the hands and eyes. The purpose of this study is to effectively enhance request entry by issuing instructions for use in an easy-to-understand manner without using visual information. Our proposal uses a pair of conversational agents  one is called the main agent  and the other is called the sub-agent  that have different voice types. Experiments show that agent pairing yields easier to understand instructions than using just the main agent. Furthermore  experiments also show that use instructions are easier to understand if the sub-agent reads aloud specific examples of use.
LBW2621: Wizard of Oz Prototyping for Machine Learning Experiences,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jacob T. Browne  Twickle,Machine learning is being adopted in a wide range of products and services. Despite its adoption  design and research processes for machine learning experiences have yet to be cemented in the user experience community. Prototyping machine learning experiences is noted to be particularly challenging. This paper suggests Wizard of Oz prototyping to help designers incorporate human-centered design processes into the development of machine learning experiences. This paper also surfaces a set of topics to consider in evaluating Wizard of Oz machine learning prototypes.
LBW2622: Gender Effects on Collaborative Online Brainstorming Teamwork,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Chien Wen (Tina) Yuan  Fu Jen University Yu-Hsuan Liu  National Tsing Hua University Hao-Chuan Wang  University of California  Davis Yuan-Chi Tseng  National Tsing Hua University,It is common for individuals with diverse demographic backgrounds to collaborate through computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies. Groups with internal diversity are typically considered to be advantageous to group performance due to the presence of different perspectives and the potential to stimulate new ideas. However  intergroup conflicts can also occur in diverse groups  especially for groups with imbalanced composition. Previous studies have pointed out that minority members often suffer from unequal participation and performance pressure  which may further decrease group outcome. Since CMC tools facilitate online collaboration  it is necessary to understand how group composition interacts with the affordances of CMC tools on group collaboration. In this study  we tested three gender compositions (female-majority  equal-gender-composition  male-majority) with two communication contexts (video-text  text-only) and found that both gender composition and communication medium influenced group collaboration. Design implications for online collaboration are provided based on our findings.
LBW2710: Virtual Observation of Virtual Reality Simulations,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Scott Ronald Howie  University of the West of Scotland Marco Gilardi  University of the West of Scotland,Unlike conventional desktop simulations which have constrained interaction  immersive Virtual Reality (VR) allows users to freely move and interact with objects. In this paper we discuss a work-in-progress system that 'virtually' records participants movement and actions within a simulation. This system recovers and rebuilds recorded data on request  accurately replaying individual participants motions and actions in the simulation. Observers can review this reconstruction using an unrestricted virtual camera and if necessary  observe changes from recorded input devices. Reconstruction of each participants' skeleton structure was created using tracked input devices. We conclude that our system offers detailed recreation of high-level knowledge and visual information of participant actions during simulations.
LBW2711: On How Users Edit Computer-Generated Visual Stories,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ting-Yao Hsu  Pennsylvania State University Yen-Chia Hsu  Carnegie Mellon University Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang  Pennsylvania State University,A significant body of research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has focused on generating stories automatically  either based on prior story plots or input images. However  literature has little to say about how users would receive and use these stories. Given the quality of stories generated by modern AI algorithms  users will nearly inevitably have to edit these stories before putting them to real use. In this paper  we present the first analysis of how human users edit machine-generated stories. We obtained 962 short stories generated by one of the state-of-the-art visual storytelling models. For each story  we recruited five crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to edit it. Our analysis of these edits shows that  on average  users (i) slightly shortened machine-generated stories  (ii) increased lexical diversity in these stories  and (iii) often replaced nouns and their determiners/articles with pronouns. Our study provides a better understanding on how users receive and edit machine-generated stories  informing future researchers to create more usable and helpful story generation systems.
LBW2712: Proxemo or How to Evaluate User Experience for People with Dementia,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Stephan Huber  Julius-Maximilians-Universität Alexander Bejan  Furtwangen University Beate Radzey  Demenz Support Stuttgart gGmbh Jörn Hurtienne  Julius-Maximilians-Universität,Most user experience (UX) evaluation tools require users to self-reflect and to communicate their thoughts (e.g. thinking aloud  retrospective interviews  questionnaires). In the context of designing for people with dementia  however  conditions like aphasia and general cognitive decline restrict the applicability of these methods. In this paper  we report on the iterative design of Proxemo  a smartwatch app for the documentation of observed emotions in people with dementia. Evaluations of Proxemo in dementia care facilities showed that observers considered Proxemo easy to use and preferred it over note-taking on paper. The agreement between different coders was substantial (? = .71). We conclude that Proxemo is a promising tool for UX evaluations in the dementia context – and possibly beyond  but further research on the analysis of its generated data is required.
LBW2713: Creating Manageable Persona Sets from Large User Populations,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Bernard J. Jansen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Soon-Gyo Jung  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Joni Salminen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University,Creating personas from actual online user information is an advantage of the data-driven persona approach. However  modern online systems often provide big data from millions of users that display vastly different behaviors  resulting in possibly thousands of personas representing the entire user population. We present a technique for reducing the number of personas to a smaller number that efficiently represents the complete user population  while being more manageable for end users of personas. We first isolate the key user behaviors and demographical attributes  creating thin personas  and we then apply an algorithmic cost function to collapse the set to the minimum needed to represent the whole population. We evaluate our approach on 26 million user records of a major international airline  isolating 1593 personas. Applying our approach  we collapse this number to 493  a 69% decrease in the number of personas. Our research findings have implications for organizations that have a large user population and desire to employ personas.
LBW2714: Personas Changing Over Time: Analyzing Variations of Data-Driven Personas During a Two-Year Period,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Soon-Gyo Jung  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Joni Salminen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Bernard J. Jansen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University,One of the critiques of personas is that the underlying data that they are based on may stale  requiring further rounds of data collection. However  we could find no empirical evidence for this criticism. In this research  we collect monthly demographic data over a two-year period for a large online content publisher and generate fifteen personas each month following an identical algorithmic approach. We then compare the sets of personas month-over-month  year-over-year  and over the whole two-year period. Findings show that there is an average 18.7% change in personas monthly  a 23.3% change yearly  and a 47% change over the entire period. Findings support the critique that personas do change over time and also highlight that changes in the underlying data can occur within a relatively short period. The implication is that organizations using personas should employ ongoing data collection to detect possible persona changes.
LBW2715: Exploring Effects of Conversational Fillers on User Perception of Conversational Agents,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yuin Jeong  Yonsei University Juho Lee  Yonsei University Youn Ah Kang  Yonsei University,Through technological advancements in various areas of our lives  Conversational Agents progressed in their human-likeness. In the field of HCI  however  the use of conversational fillers (e.g.  "um " "uh " etc.) by Conversational Agents have not been fully explored in an experimental setting. We observed the effects on user perceptions of Intelligence  Human-likeness and Likability of Conversational Agents by a 2 x 2 experimental design. From the results of 26 total participants  we concluded that 1) the use of fillers by Conversational Agents are perceived as less intelligent and less likable in task-oriented conversations  2) and the fillers did not have any statistically significant change in perception of human-likeness. However  further examination showed that users reported filler-speaking agents as more entertaining for social-oriented conversations. With these findings  we discuss design implications for voice-based Conversational Agents.
LBW2716: The Effectiveness of Nudging in Commercial Settings and Impact on User Trust,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Katarzyna Katner  City  University of London Radu Jianu  City  University of London,Persuasive technologies and nudging are increasingly used to shape user behaviors in applications ranging from health and the environment to business. A thorough understanding of the effectiveness of nudges across different contexts and whether they affect user perception of a system is still lacking. We report the results of a controlled  quantitative study with 20 participants which focused on testing the effectiveness of three different nudges in an e-commerce environment and whether their use has an impact on participants' trust. We found that products nudged via an anchoring effect were more frequently "bought" by participants  and that while participants deemed a store version implementing nudges and one which did not to be equally trustworthy  they perceived the former as technically inferior. Overall we found the effects of nudging to be less dominant than reported in previous studies.
LBW2717: Tell Me More: Understanding User Interaction of Smart Speaker News Powered by Conversational Search,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hyunhoon Jung  NAVER Clova AI Changhoon Oh  Seoul National University Gilhwan Hwang  Seoul National University Cindy Yoonjung Oh  Seoul National University Joonhwan Lee  Seoul National University Bongwon Suh  Seoul National University,In this study  we apply a "conversational search" to the design of the news service of smart speakers so that users can actively get richer information while listening to the news. We designed a research prototype called "Anchor " where a smart speaker news assistant provides users with news about specific keywords and responds to users' questions. We recruited 21 participants and conducted a user study where they consumed the news with Anchor  followed by post hoc interviews. The results of the qualitative analysis revealed the following. (1) People preferred interactive news to news briefings. (2) People found it useful to get answers on their questions by talking with the assistant. (3) Although users were allowed to ask questions anytime  they often hesitated  as they did not want to miss the whole flow of the news. (4) However  they had difficulty recalling the questions they had not asked. Based on these findings  we discuss the implications for news design in a voice-only user interface.
LBW2718: Cross-study Reliability of the Open Card Sorting Method,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Christos Katsanos  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Nikolaos Tselios  University of Patras Nikolaos Avouris  University of Patras Stavros Demetriadis  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Ioannis Stamelos  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Lefteris Angelis  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Information architecture forms the foundation of users' navigation experience. Open card sorting is a widely-used method to create information architectures based on users' groupings of the content. However  little is known about the method's cross-study reliability: Does it produce consistent content groupings for similar profile participants involved in different card sort studies? This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the method's cross-study reliability. Six card sorts involving 140 participants were conducted: three open sorts for a travel website  and three for an eshop. Results showed that participants provided highly similar card sorting data for the same content. A rather high agreement of the produced navigation schemes was also found. These findings provide support for the cross-study reliability of the open card sorting method.
LBW2719: Synaesthetic-Translation Tool: Synaesthesia as an Interactive Material for Ideation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Chang Hee Lee  Royal College of Art Dan Lockton  Carnegie Mellon University John Stevens  Royal College of Art Stephen Jia Wang  Royal College of Art SungHee Ahn  Hongik University,While the subject of synaesthesia has inspired various practitioners and has been utilized as a design material in different formats  research has not so far presented a way to apply this captivating phenomenon as a source of design material in HCI. The purpose of this paper is to explore the translative property of synaesthesia and introduce a tangible way to use this intangible phenomenon as an interactive design material source in HCI and design. This paper shares a card-based tool that enables practitioners to use the translative property of synaesthesia for the sake of ideation. It further introduces a potential area of where this tool may be utilized for exploring user experiences. This work has implications for the CHI community as it attempts to share a practical way of using the intangible property of synaesthesia to explore potential user experiences.
LBW2720: How Performing an Activity Makes Meaning,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Eva Lenz  University of Siegen Marc Hassenzahl  University of Siegen Sarah Diefenbach  Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich,The analysis of tasks and workflows is a longstanding tradition in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In many cases  it provides a crucial basis for the usable design of interactive systems. However  established tools almost exclusively focus on task content and structure  thereby ignoring the more "experiential" aspects of task performance. To fill this gap  we combined Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) with the analysis of subjective accounts of meaning. Our explorative study (N=4) suggests that objective descriptions resulting from HTA and subjective experience of one and the same activity differ. People tend to subsume experientially unimportant sequences or even ignore these within their subjective experience. Furthermore  people are able to name experientially important sequences and to relate these to feelings and thoughts (i.e.  meaning). In the future  more refined versions of our approach may support practitioners with the design of meaningful interaction and activities.
LBW2721: Effect of Personality Traits on UX Evaluation Metrics: A Study on Usability Issues  Valence-Arousal and Skin Conductance,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alexandros Liapis  Hellenic Open University Christos Katsanos  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Michalis Xenos  University of Patras Theofanis Orphanoudakis  Hellenic Open University,Personality affects the way someone feels or acts. This paper examines the effect of personality traits  as operationalized by the Big-five questionnaire  on the number  type and severity of identified usability issues  physiological signals (skin conductance)  and subjective emotional ratings (valence-arousal). Twenty-four users interacted with a web service and then participated in a retrospective thinking aloud session. Results revealed that the number of usability issues is significantly affected by the Openness trait. Emotional Stability significantly affects the type of reported usability issues. Problem severity is not affected by any trait. Valence ratings are significantly affected by Conscientiousness  whereas Agreeableness  Emotional Stability and Openness significantly affect arousal ratings. Finally  Openness has a significant effect on the number of detected peaks in user's skin conductance.
LBW2722: Creating Positive Experiences with Digital Companions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Michael Burmester  Stuttgart Media University Katharina Zeiner  Siemens AG & Stuttgart Media University Katharina Schippert  Stuttgart Media University & IBM Design Studio Böblingen Axel Platz  Siemens AG,Over the last decade  advances in machine learning have multiplied the possibilities for applications of artificial intelligence. One of these applications are digital companions that assist their users in tasks and activities. In this study  we wanted to evaluate whether digital companions can be designed to create possibilities for positive experiences in work contexts and also be perceived as such using a Wizard-of-Oz prototype of a companion that supports workshop planning. We find that the work is perceived as more positive  more natural  and the content that is presented as more positive after the interaction with a companion that has been designed for positive experience compared to a neutral companion with the same functionality.
LBW2810: Minimalistic Explanations: Capturing the Essence of Decisions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Martin Schuessler  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut Philipp Weiß  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut,The use of complex machine learning models can make systems opaque to users. Machine learning research proposes the use of post-hoc explanations. However  it is unclear if they give users insights into otherwise uninterpretable models. One minimalistic way of explaining image classifications by a deep neural network is to show only the areas that were decisive for the assignment of a label. In a pilot study  20 participants looked at 14 of such explanations generated either by a human or the LIME algorithm. For explanations of correct decisions  they identified the explained object with significantly higher accuracy (75.64 % vs. 18.52 %). We argue that this shows that explanations can be very minimalistic while retaining the essence of a decision  but the decision-making contexts that can be conveyed in this manner is limited. Finally  we found that explanations are unique to the explainer and human-generated explanations were assigned 79 % higher trust ratings. As a starting point for further studies  this work shares our first insights into quality criteria of post-hoc explanations.
LBW2811: Studying User Experience of a Hybrid Location Sensing System,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yun Huang  Syracuse University Yisi Sang  Syracuse University Qunfang Wu  Syracuse University Yaxing Yao  Syracuse University,The HCI community has extensively studied location-based systems that applied various location sensing technologies. However  there is a lack of user experience (UX) studies of systems where hybrid location sensing approaches are provided. In this work  we designed  implemented and studied a hybrid location sharing system that offers automatic location sensing through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and participatory location sharing using GPS. Our findings provide design implications to future location-based systems that apply such a hybrid location sensing design.
LBW2812: Effects of Influence on User Trust in Predictive Decision Making,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jianlong Zhou  University of Technology Sydney Zhidong Li  University of Technology Sydney Huaiwen Hu  DATA61  CSIRO Kun Yu  University of Technology Sydney Fang Chen  University of Technology Sydney Zelin Li  DATA61  CSIRO Yang Wang  University of Technology Sydney,This paper introduces fact-checking into Machine Learning (ML) explanation by referring training data points as facts to users to boost user trust. We aim to investigate what influence of training data points  and how they affect user trust in order to enhance ML explanation and boost user trust. We tackle this question by allowing users check the training data points that have the higher influence and the lower influence on the prediction. A user study found that the presentation of influences significantly increases the user trust in predictions  but only for training data points with higher influence values under the high model performance condition  where users can justify their actions with more similar facts.
LBW2822: Do We Need Natural Language? Exploring Restricted Language Interfaces for Complex Domains,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jesse Mu  Stanford University Advait Sarkar  Microsoft Research,Natural language interfaces (NLIs) that aim to understand arbitrary language are not only difficult to engineer; they can also create unrealistic expectations of the capabilities of the system  resulting in user confusion and disappointment. We use an interactive language learning game in a 3D blocks world to examine whether limiting a user's communication to a small set of artificial utterances is an acceptable alternative to the much harder task of accepting unrestricted language. We find that such a restricted language interface provides same or better performance on this task while improving user experience indices. This suggests that some NLIs can restrict user languages without sacrificing user experience and highlights the importance of conveying NLI limitations to users.
SRC01: Can Changes in Heart Rate Variability Represented in Sound be Identified by Non-Medical Experts?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mariam Bahameish  Queen Mary University of London,Heart rate variability (HRV) has become a wide-spread area for the investigation of the health and stress states of individuals. This paper aims at exploring the effectiveness of representing HRV measures with alternative modalities  other than visual displays  such as audio or haptics. Therefore  we undertook a preliminary study in which we applied a parameter mapping sonification approach to transform the HRV signal into an audible form. In this work  we sought to evaluate the human perception of the developed auditory interface. Hence  a dataset that involves interbeat interval measurements of individuals experiencing changes in mental state in the form of meditation was selected as the basis of the study. The HRV parameters of the dataset were mapped to acoustic features using a linear mapping technique. The feasibility of the system was assessed by measuring the learnability  performance  latency  and confidence aspects. The results suggest a great potential of incorporating auditory displays in the analysis of HRV. Participants were able to distinguish the different meditation states and types with minimal training time. However  further studies should be conducted on a larger population to provide verification of the findings of this preliminary study.
SRC02: Muse: Scaffolding Metacognitive Reflection in Design-Based Research,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Victoria Cabales  Northwestern University,While learning science research has explored approaches improving students' problem solving skills by introducing tools that support students in metacognitive reflection  this work has focused on problems with clear solutions  rather than addressing the question of how metacognitive reflection can help students develop their self-regulation skills  which help students understand and control their learning environment through planning  practice  and self-evaluation. This paper presents Muse  an in-action chatbot interface that prompts students to reflect metacognitively on their self-direction process in the midst of working on their independent research projects. Students participate in the Design  Technology  and Research (DTR) program  which provides several undergrads the opportunity to self-direct an independent research project by using the socio-technological model Agile Research Studios (ARS). Results from a case study suggest that Muse helps students identify time consuming habits and set aside less important tasks by giving participants the opportunity to act on their reflections and adjust aspects of their process that they deem less effective.
SRC03: Guidelines for Combining Storytelling and Gamification: Which Features Would Teenagers Desire to Have a More Enjoyable Museum Experience?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Vanessa Cesário  University of Porto & Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute,While museums are often designed to engage and interest a wide variety of audiences  teenagers are a neglected segment. This PhD research in Digital Media explores how digital technologies can facilitate natural history museums in creating immersive museum experiences for teenagers (15–18 years old)  especially through digital storytelling and gamification frameworks. This contribution would be a set of guidelines that will aid in designing interactive experiences inside these museums. So far  we have involved a total of 155 teens through co-design sessions  130 in focus groups  and 98 in usability studies  as well as 3 museums  12 curators  and 17 master students. Through qualitative analysis  our preliminary findings suggest that teenagers value gamification and storytelling elements when thinking about enjoyable museum tours  while curators value story-based narratives as the most prominent method to provide enjoyable museum experience for teens. Based on the findings identified  and in collaboration with the Madeira-ITI  two interactive mobile experiences targeted at teenagers were developed for the Natural History Museum of Funchal  Portugal.
SRC04: Understanding the Occupational Therapists Method to Inform the Design of Technologies for People with Dementia,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Emma Dixon  University of Maryland  College Park,This paper describes a PhD research project involving people with dementia and practitioners who work primarily with people with dementia to support engagement in meaningful activities and activities of everyday living. The aim of this work is to develop a technology which adapts to changing cognitive demands of people with dementia in order to facilitate continuous engagement in meaningful activities. In depth  semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners to understand their methods for personalization of activities and the implications for design of future adaptive technologies. Preliminary results from interviews with Occupational Therapists are presented.
SRC05: Lake: A Digital Wizard of Oz Prototyping Tool,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Andrew Finke  Northwestern University,Mobile app designers aim to develop the best mobile software interfaces in the least amount of time  and rely on testing ideas with prototypes in lieu of building costly  fully functioning applications. Yet  designers cannot effectively prototype some complex app experiences  including augmented reality applications like Pokémon GO  because existing tools lack the needed features  or because prototyping in them is too time intensive to be feasible. To solve this problem  we introduce Lake  a mobile application prototyping tool that enables the creation of complex mobile applications with the same ease as paper prototyping. By leveraging the Wizard of Oz technique used in paper prototyping in our digital medium  we enable designers to prototype at the same low cost as paper  but at a much higher fidelity. Through a pilot study (N=6)  we find that designers are able to gather organic in-context feedback from complex prototypes made with Lake.
SRC06: Automatic Speech Recognition Services: Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Usability,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Abraham Glasser  Rochester Institute of Technology,Nowadays  speech is becoming a more common  if not standard  interface to technology. This can be seen in the trend of technology changes over the years. Increasingly  voice is used to control programs  appliances and personal devices within homes  cars  workplaces  and public spaces through smartphones and home assistant devices using Amazon's Alexa  Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri  and other proliferating technologies. However  most speech interfaces are not accessible for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) people. In this paper  performances of current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with voices of DHH speakers are evaluated. ASR has improved over the years  and is able to reach Word Error Rates (WER) as low as 5-6% [1][2][3]  with the help of cloud-computing and machine learning algorithms that take in custom vocabulary models. In this paper  a custom vocabulary model is used  and the significance of the improvement is evaluated when using DHH speech.
SRC07: Affordable Smart Wheelchair,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Isabella Gomez Torres  University of California  San Diego Gaurav Parmar  University of California  San Diego Sammarth Aggarwal  University of California  San Diego Nathaniel Mansur  University of California  San Diego Alec Guthrie  University California  San Diego,Power wheelchairs (PW) are an example of an assistive technology in that they are used to increase  maintain  or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities [6]. As seen in [5] [3]  the commercially available products do not provide any assistance beyond enhanced mobility. Furthermore  existing PW research fails at comprehensively noting an individual's challenges  such as navigating through narrow passages or fixing their broken wheelchairs. Instead  they focus mostly on novel interaction methods such as BCI  head and gaze control [9] [15]. In this paper  we explore these individual needs and show that PWs have the novel potential to become a smart wheelchair at an affordable price. Our research follows the double diamond (DD) process [2] and relies on the participatory design (PD) methodology [7]  which addresses all stakeholders involved. Namely  we consider individuals with wheelchairs  the assistive technology research community  and the PW industry. For further insight we also contacted medical doctors  healthcare professionals  and non- profit organizations. We spent time getting to know these communities through interviews  surveys  demonstrations  and continuous user inputs  aligning our work to the PD tools. We found that individuals using wheelchairs overall desire safety  accessibility  and a durable design. Guided by these results  we designed a proof of concept (POC) system called the Affordable Smart Wheelchair (ASW) for indoor use. This kit implements full-autonomy in the form of indoor navigation from one room to another and to predetermined docking locations through voice control. It also has semi-autonomous functions in the form of manual joystick control augmented with real-time collision avoidance and staircase detection.
SRC08: Math Graphs for the Visually Impaired: Audio Presentation of Elements of Mathematical Graphs,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jeongyeon Kim  Sogang University Yoonah Lee  Sogang University Inho Seo  Sogang University,The sense of sight takes a dominating role in learning mathematical graphs. Most visually impaired students drop out of mathematics because necessary content is inaccessible. Sonification and auditory graphs have been the primary methods of representing data through sound. However  the representation of mathematical elements of graphs is still unexplored. The experiments in this paper investigate optimal methods for representing mathematical elements of graphs with sound. The results indicate that the methods of design in this study are effective for describing mathematical elements of graphs  such as axes  quadrants and differentiability. These findings can help visually impaired learners to be more independent  and also facilitate further studies on assistive technology.
SRC09: I Am What You Eat: Effects of Social Influence on Meal Selection Online,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Maria D. Molina  Pennsylvania State University,The availability of mHealth technologies has increased exponentially  particularly fitness and calorie tracking applications. Recent studies and anecdotal evidence has highlighted the potential of these technologies to serve as tools of bad eating behavior due to its focus on self-monitoring and calorie counting. The current research investigates on the potential of using social-orienting features of technology  specifically bandwagon and identity cues  to incentivize food-based nutrition (FBN) rather than a calorie-only approach. For this purpose  a 2 x 2 mixed factorial online experiment was conducted with bandwagon cue as a within-subject factor and identity cue as a between-subject factor. Results reveal that 67.6% of participants selected high bandwagon cue meals  regardless of its nutritional value. Bandwagon perception was the only significant predictor of meal selection  indicating that an increase in one unit improved the odds of an individual choosing a high bandwagon meal by 69%.
SRC10: Designing Compassion Cultivating Interactions for New Mothers,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Annu Sible Prabhakar  University of Cincinnati & Indiana University,This paper describes a research project that aims to examine an unexplored design space-compassion cultivation for wellness. This project seeks to understand the components of compassionate interactions between new mothers and their proximate and primary supporters-partners -- to inform the design of compassion cultivating interventions for maternal wellness. A discussion of research activities undertaken thus far and preliminary results are presented.
SRC11: Family-Centered Exploration of the Benefits and Burdens of Digital Home Assistants,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Olivia K. Richards  Pennsylvania State University,Parents receive conflicting information on the benefits and burdens of children's technology use  especially novel technologies such as digital home assistants. To understand parents' views  we analyzed relevant Amazon Echo device product reviews posted to Amazon.com  and deployed a User Benefit and Burden Survey to 131 parents on Amazon Mechanical Turk to explore their perspectives of Amazon Echo digital home assistants. Our work explores parents' perceptions of the devices with regards to their children and families  in terms of attributes such as benefits and burdens. This study contributes an empirical  family-centered understanding of and design opportunities for whole home personal assistants in support of a diversity of families.
SRC12: Privacy Therapy with Aretha: What If Your Firewall Could Talk?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,William Seymour  University of Oxford,The rapid adoption of smart home devices has brought with it a widespread lack of understanding amongst users over where their devices send data. Smart home ecosystems represent complex additions to existing wicked problems around network privacy and security in the home. This work presents the Aretha project  a device which combines the functionality of a firewall with the position of voice assistants as the hub of the smart home  and the sophistication of modern conversational voice interfaces. The result is a device which can engage users in conversation about network privacy and security  allowing for the forming and development of complex preferences that Aretha is then able to act upon.
SRC13: ParaXplore: Demystifying the Exploration of Large Design Spaces,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Naghmi Shireen  Simon Fraser University,Generative design tools together with large screen displays provide designers an opportunity to explore large numbers of design alternatives. There are numerous design studies on exploring multiple simultaneous designs  but few present interface solutions and system features for such exploration. To the best of my knowledge  no study probes exploring a large design space with multiple simultaneous states. The premise of my research is that  if designers can work directly with large numbers of designs with new representations and tools as part of the design workflow  we should expect new patterns and strategies to emerge and change the design process. Such task environments may present novel actions  task sequences  methods and techniques. What are new actions and techniques that would enable working seamlessly with multiple designs? My research aims to answer this (and similar) questions; and  more specifically  to uncover how designers' augment their work through spatial structuring of the task environment to reduce the cognitive cost of working with multiple simultaneous designs on a large work-surface. I conducted a lab experiment with nine designers. The results suggest design features for new front-end gallery interfaces for managing a large set of design variations while enabling simultaneous editing.
SRC14: Sense of Familiarity: Improving Older Adults' Adaptation to Exergames,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Hao Zhang  Nanyang Technological University,Exergames are proven to be effective in helping older adults improve their physical and mental capabilities. However  older adults' maladaptation to exergames may occur due to the complexity of game tasks and interfaces. In this work  we show that familiarity can improve older adults' adaptation to exergames. The results of our first study indicate that older adults with higher level of familiarity to exergames exhibit higher level of motivation and ability. To maximize the effectiveness of exergames  it is helpful to provide older adults exergames which they are more familiar with. To evaluate the familiarity level of exergames  we propose a novel familiarity model with five factors  namely prior experience  positive emotion  repeated time  level of processing  and retention rate. Results from our second study show that the identified five factors have significant positive correlations with familiarity and there is a high positive correlation between familiarity levels and participants' satisfaction to the exergames.
SRC15: GPK: An Efficient Special Symbol Input Method for Keyboards,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Xiyuan He  Zhejiang University Zhuohao Zhang  Zhejiang University,We introduce a novel typing technique for special symbols in the keyboard-only environment. The technique  called GPK (Gliding on Physical Keyboard)  consists of two steps for entering special symbols. First  a user draws the special symbol on the keyboard by gliding over keys; Second  the user can select the desired symbol from the predicted symbols generated by GPK. Users can also switch from this mode to normal typing mode. We also present an application of this input technique based on web browsers. A user study with nine participants who are familiar with keyboard input showed the input efficiency of GPK. We compared the typing efficiency of GPK with other special symbol typing methods. We could deploy this method to office environments where users have desktop computers with a keyboard only. It could also inspire future work of integrating this method into word processors  document preparation systems and web environments.
DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.
DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of "futuring" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities.
DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.

Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.
DC20: Co-Designing Digital Technologies to Support Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Cara Wilson  Queensland University of Technology,This doctoral work considers how to best co-design with minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum in classroom contexts. It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.
DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.
DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of "futuring" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities.
DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 10:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.

Impulse Buying: Design Practices and Consumer Needs,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Carol Moser  University of Michigan Sarita Y. Schoenebeck  University of Michigan Paul Resnick  University of Michigan,E-commerce sites have an incentive to encourage impulse buying  even when not in the consumer's best interest. This study investigates what features e-commerce sites use to encourage impulse buying and what tools consumers desire to curb their online spending. We present two studies: (1) a systematic content analysis of 200 top e-commerce websites in the U.S. and (2) a survey of online impulse buyers (N=151). From Study 1  we find that e-commerce sites contain multiple features that encourage impulsive buying  including those that lower perceived risks  leverage social influence  and enhance perceived proximity to the product. Conversely  from Study 2 we find that online impulse buyers want tools that (a) encourage deliberation and avoidance  (b) enforce spending limits and postponement  (c) increase checkout effort  (d) make costs more salient  and (e) reduce product desire. These findings inform the design of "friction'' technologies that help users make more deliberative consumer choices.
How do People Sort by Ratings?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Jerry O. Talton  Carta  Inc. Krishna Dusad  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Konstantinos Koiliaris  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Ranjitha S. Kumar  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Sorting items by user rating is a fundamental interaction pattern of the modern Web  used to rank products (Amazon)  posts (Reddit)  businesses (Yelp)  movies (YouTube)  and more. To implement this pattern  designers must take in a distribution of ratings for each item and define a sensible total ordering over them. This is a challenging problem  since each distribution is drawn from a distinct sample population  rendering the most straightforward method of sorting --- comparing averages --- unreliable when the samples are small or of different sizes. Several statistical orderings for binary ratings have been proposed in the literature (e.g.  based on the Wilson score  or Laplace smoothing)  each attempting to account for the uncertainty introduced by sampling. In this paper  we study this uncertainty through the lens of human perception  and ask "How do people sort by ratings?" In an online study  we collected 48 000 item-ranking pairs from 4 000 crowd workers along with 4 800 rationales  and analyzed the results to understand how users make decisions when comparing rated items. Our results shed light on the cognitive models users employ to choose between rating distributions  which sorts of comparisons are most contentious  and how the presentation of rating information affects users' preferences.
Programmable Donations: Exploring Escrow-Based Conditional Giving,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Chris Elsden  Northumbria University Ludwig Trotter  Lancaster University Mike Harding  Lancaster University Nigel Davies  Lancaster University Chris Speed  University of Edinburgh John Vines  Northumbria University,This paper reports on a co-speculative interview study with charitable donors to explore the future of programmable  conditional and data-driven donations. Responding to the rapid emergence of blockchain-based and AI-supported financial technologies  we specifically examine the potential of automated  third-party 'escrows'  where donations are held before they are released or returned based on specified rules and conditions. To explore this we conducted pilot workshops with 9 participants and an interview study in which 14 further participants were asked about their experiences of donating money  and invited to co-speculate on a service for programmable giving. The study elicited how data-driven conditionality and automation could be leveraged to create novel donor experiences  however also illustrated the inherent tensions and challenges involved in giving programmatically. Reflecting on these findings  our paper contributes implications both for the design of programmable aid platforms  and the design of escrow-based financial services in general.
Inalienability: Understanding Digital Gifts,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Jocelyn Spence  University of Nottingham,This paper takes on one of the rarely articulated yet important questions pertaining to digital media objects: how do HCI and design researchers understand 'gifting' when the object can just as easily be 'shared'? This question has often been implied and occasionally answered  though only partially. We propose the concept of 'inalienability'  taken from the gifting literature  as a useful theory for clarifying what design researchers mean by gifting in a digital context. We apply 'inalienability' to three papers from the ACM Digital Library and one ongoing project  spanning nearly two decades of HCI and design research  that combine 'gifting and 'sharing' in their frameworks. In this way we show how applying the concept of 'inalienability' can clarify behaviours that mark gifting as a unique activity  frame research questions around gifting and sharing  outline specific next steps for gifting research  and suggest design strategies in this area.
Causeway: Scaling Situated Learning with Micro-Role Hierarchies,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,David T. Lee  University of California  Santa Cruz Emily S. Hamedian  University of California  Santa Cruz Greg Wolff  University of California  Santa Cruz Amy Liu  LinkedIn,While educational technologies such as MOOCs have helped scale content-based learning  scaling situated learning is still challenging. The time it takes to define a real-world project and to mentor learners is often prohibitive  especially given the limited contributions that novices are able to make. This paper introduces micro-role hierarchies  a form of coordination that integrates workflows and hierarchies to help short-term novices predictably contribute to complex projects. Individuals contribute through micro-roles  small experiential assignments taking roughly 2 hours. These micro-roles support execution of the desired work process  but also sequence into learning pathways  resulting in a learning dynamic similar to moving up an organizational hierarchy. We demonstrate micro-role hierarchies through Causeway  a platform for learning web development while building websites for nonprofits. We carry out a proof-of-concept study in which learners built static websites for refugee resettlement agencies in 2 hour long roles.
Integrating Multimedia Tools to Enrich Interactions in Live Streaming for Language Learning,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Di (Laura) Chen  University of Toronto Dustin Freeman  Escape Character Inc. Ravin Balakrishnan  University of Toronto,Online language lessons have adopted live broadcasted videos to provide more real-time interactive experiences between language teachers and learners. However  learner interactions are primarily limited to the built-in text chat in the live stream. Using text alone  learners cannot get feedback on important aspects of a language  such as speaking skills  that are afforded only by offering richer types of interactions. We present results from a 2-week in-the-wild study  in which we investigate the use of text  audio  video  image  and stickers as interaction tools for language teachers and learners in live streaming. Our language teacher explored three different teaching strategies over four live streamed English lessons  while nine students watched and interacted using multimodal tools. The findings reveal that multimodal communication yields instant feedback and increased engagement  but its use is dependent on factors such as group size  surroundings  time  and online identity.
How Do Distance Learners Connect?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Na Sun  Pennsylvania State University Xiying Wang  Pennsylvania State University Mary Beth Rosson  Pennsylvania State University,Distance learners often experience social isolation and impoverished social interaction with their remote peers. To better understand the connections that distance learners are able to build with peers  we interviewed them about whether and how they perceive or cultivate connections with one another. Our analysis reveals how connections in an online learning environment are formed and experienced across different social contexts and technology affordances  and what strategies and practices enable and inhibit these connections. We discuss the implications of our findings for concepts of shared identity and evolving peer relationships among online learners and for design directions that might address their social needs.
Continuous Evaluation of Video Lectures from Real-Time Difficulty Self-Report,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Namrata Srivastava  The University of Melbourne Eduardo Velloso  University of Melbourne Jason M. Lodge  University of Queensland Sarah Erfani  The University of Melbourne James Bailey  The University of Melbourne,With the increased reach and impact of video lectures  it is crucial to understand how they are experienced. Whereas previous studies typically present questionnaires at the end of the lecture  they fail to capture students' experience in enough granularity. In this paper we propose recording the lecture difficulty in real-time with a physical slider  enabling continuous and fine-grained analysis of the learning experience. We evaluated our approach in a study with 100 participants viewing two variants of two short lectures. We demonstrate that our approach helps us paint a more complete picture of the learning experience. Our analysis has design implications for instructors  providing them with a method that helps them compare their expectations with students' beliefs about the lectures and to better understand the specific effects of different instructional design decisions.
Young Children's Reading and Learning with Conversational Agents,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Ying Xu  University of California  Irvine Mark Warschauer  University of California  Irvine,Young children increasingly interact with voice-driven interfaces  such as conversational agents (CAs). The social nature of CAs makes them good learning partners for children. We have designed a storytelling CA to engage children in book reading activities. This case study presents the design of this CA and investigates children's interactions with and perception of the CA. Through observation  we found that children actively responded to the CA's prompts  reacted to the CA's feedback with great affect  and quickly learned the schema of interacting with a digital interlocutor. We also discovered that the availability of scaffolding appeared to facilitate child-CA conversation and learning. A brief post-reading interview suggested that children enjoyed their interaction with the CA. Design implications for dialogic systems for young children's informal learning are discussed.
Teaching Data Visualization and Storytelling with Data Comic Workshops,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Zezhong Wang  University of Edinburgh Harvey Dingwall  University of Edinburgh Benjamin Bach  Edinburgh University,This paper presents a method for hands-on creation of data comics in a workshop context and includes a description of the results  lessons learned and future improvements. Data comics is a promising format for data-driven storytelling  leveraging the power of data visualization and visual storytelling with comics. However  authoring data comics requires a diverse range of skills that are both creative and analytical. Our workshop is aimed at developing a blue-print for future workshops and reflecting on challenges and potential improvements. Within a 3-week assignment for an illustration class  we ran three 3-hour sessions. Our design was informed by the experiences of previous data-comics workshops. Results show the creative potential of data comics. Challenges to learn from the workshop include the stages to introduce data visualizations and journalistic narratives  the structuring of stories and the method of developing iterations of comic drafts. We close by reflecting on these challenges and how they can inform future improvements and adaptations.
Children's Reflection in Action with DIY,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Silvia Torsi  Università di Bari "Aldo Moro" Loredana Verardi  Università di Bari "Aldo Moro" Carmelo Ardito  Università di Bari "Aldo Moro",The present case study describes and comments on an experimental activity with 9-11 year old children of a public school in Lecce (Italy) in August 2018. The pupils were required to create computational tools using materials recycled from their own home. We adopted a constructionist perspective; we wanted to foster reflection and discussion among the young participants on the amount of household waste produced and how it can be repurposed for creating novel objects. In order to achieve our scope  we were guided by collapse informatics theory and research through design.
Effects of Participatory Evaluation – A Critical Actor-Network Analysis,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Katta Spiel  TU Wien Christopher Frauenberger  TU Wien Geraldine Fitzpatrick  TU Wien Eva Hornecker  Bauhaus-Universität Weimar,In previous work  we have developed the theoretical concept of Critical Experience and the Participatory Evaluation with Autistic ChildrEn (PEACE) method. We grounded both in a series of separate case studies which allowed us to understand how to gather more and richer insights from the children than previously. This is crucial for child-led research projects. In this paper  we present additional cases in more detail which demonstrate the applicability of our concept of Critical Experience on cases in which PEACE was used. This provides new insights into how Critical Experience handles child-led evaluation strategies and how it can be applied and potentially transferred to different contexts  guiding other researchers and practitioners in evaluating participatory processes.
Computational Interaction with Bayesian Methods,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge Nikola Banovic  University of Michigan Antti Oulasvirta  Aalto University John Williamson  University of Glasgow,This course introduces computational methods in human--computer interaction. Computational interaction methods use computational thinking---abstraction  automation  and analysis---to explain and enhance interaction. This course introduces the theory of practice of computational interaction by teaching Bayesian methods for interaction across four wide areas of interest when designing computationally-driven user interfaces: decoding  adaptation  learning and optimization. The lectures center on hands-on Python programming interleaved with theory and practical examples grounded in problems of wide interest in human-computer interaction.
Designing with the Mind in Mind: The Psychological Basis for UI Design Guidelines,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Argyll 3 CROWNE,Jeff A. Johnson  University of San Francisco,UI design rules and guidelines are not simple recipes. Applying them effectively requires determining rule applicability and precedence and balancing trade-offs when rules compete. By understanding the underlying psychology  designers and evaluators enhance their ability to apply design rules. This two-part (160-minute) course explains that psychology.
Understanding the Impact of TVIs on Technology Use and Selection by Children with Visual Impairments,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Catherine M. Baker  Creighton University Lauren R. Milne  Macalester University Richard E. Ladner  University of Washington,The use of technology in educational settings is extremely common. For many visually impaired children  educational settings are the first place they are exposed to the assistive technology that they will need to access mainstream computing devices. Current laws provide support for students to receive training from Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVIs) on these assistive devices. Therefore  TVIs play an important role in the selection and training of technology. Through our interviews with TVIs  we discovered the factors that impact which technologies they select  how they attempt to mitigate the stigma associated with certain technologies  and the challenges that students face in learning assistive technologies. Through this research  we identified three needs that future research on assistive technology should address: (1) increasing focus on built-in accessibility features  (2) providing support for independent learning and exploration  and (3) creating technologies that can support users with progressive vision loss.
StoryBlocks: A Tangible Programming Game To Create Accessible Audio Stories,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Varsha Koushik  University of Colorado Boulder Darren Guinness  University of Colorado Boulder Shaun K. Kane  University of Colorado Boulder,Block-based programming languages can support novice programmers through features such as simplified code syntax and user-friendly libraries. However  most block-based programming languages are highly visual  which makes them inaccessible to blind and visually impaired students. To address the inaccessibility of block-based languages  we introduce StoryBlocks  a tangible block-based game that enables blind programmers to learn basic programming concepts by creating audio stories. In this paper  we document the design of StoryBlocks and report on a series of design activities with groups of teachers  Braille experts  and students. Participants in our design sessions worked together to create accessible stories  and their feedback offers insights for the future development of accessible  tangible programming tools.
"It Broadens My Mind": Empowering People with Cognitive Disabilities through Computing Education,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Varsha Koushik  University of Colorado Boulder Shaun K. Kane  University of Colorado Boulder,Computer science education is widely viewed as a path to empowerment for young people  potentially leading to higher education  careers  and development of computational thinking skills. However  few resources exist for people with cognitive disabilities to learn computer science. In this paper  we document our observations of a successful program in which young adults with cognitive disabilities are trained in computing concepts. Through field observations and interviews  we identify instructional strategies used by this group  accessibility challenges encountered by this group  and how instructors and students leverage peer learning to support technical education. Our findings lead to guidelines for developing tools and curricula to support young adults with cognitive disabilities in learning computer science.
DesignABILITY: Framework for the Design of Accessible Interactive Tools to Support Teaching to Children with Disabilities,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Leandro Flórez-Aristizábal  Institución Universitaria Antonio José Camacho Sandra Cano  Universidad de San Buenaventura César A. Collazos  Universidad del Cauca Andrés F. Solano  Universidad Autónoma de Occidente Stephen Brewster  University of Glasgow,Developing educational tools aimed at children with disabilities is a challenging process for designers and developers because existing methodologies or frameworks do not provide any pedagogical information and/or do not take into account the particular needs of users with some type of impairment. In this study  we propose a framework for the design of tools to support teaching to children with disabilities. The framework provides the necessary stages for the development of tools (hardware-based or software-based) and must be adapted for a specific disability and educational goal. For this study  the framework was adapted to support literacy teaching and contributes to the design of educational/interactive technology for deaf people while making them part of the design process and taking into account their particular needs. The experts' evaluation of the framework shows that it is well structured and may be adapted for other types of disabilities.
Overcoming Distractions during Transitions from Break to Work using a Conversational Website-Blocking System,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Vincent W.-S. Tseng  Cornell University Matthew L. Lee  FXPAL Laurent Denoue  FXPAL Daniel Avrahami  FXPAL,Work breaks--both physical and digital--play an important role in productivity and workplace wellbeing. Yet  the growing availability of digital distractions from online content can turn breaks into prolonged "cyberloafing". In this paper  we present UpTime  a system that aims to support workers' transitions from breaks back to work--moments susceptible to digital distractions. Combining a browser extension and chatbot  users interact with UpTime through proactive and reactive chat prompts. By sensing transitions from inactivity  UpTime helps workers avoid distractions by automatically blocking distracting websites temporarily  while still giving them control to take necessary digital breaks. We report findings from a 3-week comparative field study with 15 workers. Our results show that automatic  temporary blocking at transition points can significantly reduce digital distractions and stress without sacrificing workers' sense of control. Our findings  however  also emphasize that overloading users' existing communication channels for chatbot interaction should be done thoughtfully.
Poirot: A Web Inspector for Designers,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Kesler Tanner  Stanford University Naomi Johnson  University of Virginia James A. Landay  Stanford University,To better understand the issues designers face as they interact with developers and use developer tools to create websites  we conducted a formative investigation consisting of interviews  a survey  and an analysis of professional design documents. Based on insights gained from these efforts  we developed Poirot  a web inspection tool for designers that enables them to make style edits to websites using a familiar graphical interface. We compared Poirot to Chrome DevTools in a lab study with 16 design professionals. We observed common problems designers experience when using Chrome DevTools and found that when using Poirot  designers were more successful in accomplishing typical design tasks (97% to 63%). In addition  we found that Poirot had a significantly lower perceived cognitive load and was overwhelmingly preferred by the designers in our study.
Guideline-Based Evaluation of Web Readability,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Aliaksei Miniukovich  University of Trento Michele Scaltritti  Università degli Studi di Trento Simone Sulpizio  Vita-Salute San Raffaele University Antonella De Angeli  Free University of Bolzano,Effortless reading remains an issue for many Web users  despite a large number of readability guidelines available to designers. This paper presents a study of manual and automatic use of 39 readability guidelines in webpage evaluation. The study collected the ground-truth readability for a set of 50 webpages using eye-tracking with average and dyslexic readers (n = 79). It then matched the ground truth against human-based (n = 35) and automatic evaluations. The results validated 22 guidelines as being connected to readability. The comparison between human-based and automatic results also revealed a complex framework: algorithms were better or as good as human experts at evaluating webpages on specific guidelines – particularly those about low-level features of webpage legibility and text formatting. However  multiple guidelines still required a human judgment related to understanding and interpreting webpage content. These results contribute a guideline categorization laying the ground for future design evaluation methods.
The Impact of Web Browser Reader Views on Reading Speed and User Experience,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Qisheng Li  University of Washington Meredith Ringel Morris  Microsoft Research Adam Fourney  Microsoft Research Kevin Larson  Microsoft Katharina Reinecke  University of Washington,As reading increasingly shifts from paper to online media  many web browsers now provide a "Reader View '' which modifies web page layout and design for better readability. However  research has yet to establish whether Reader Views are effective in improving readability and how they might change the user experience. We characterize how Mozilla Firefox's Reader View significantly reduces the visual complexity of websites by excluding menus  images  and content. We then conducted an online study with 391 participants (including 42 who self-reported having been diagnosed with dyslexia)  showing that compared to standard websites the Reader View increased reading speed by 5% for readers on average  and significantly improved perceived readability and visual appeal. We suggest guidelines for the design of websites and browsers that better support people with varying reading skills.
Deaf and Hard-of-hearing Individuals' Preferences for Wearable and Mobile Sound Awareness Technologies,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Leah Findlater  University of Washington Bonnie Chinh  University of Washington Dhruv Jain  University of Washington Jon E. Froehlich  University of Washington Raja Kushalnagar  Gallaudet University Angela Carey Lin  University of Washington,To investigate preferences for mobile and wearable sound awareness systems  we conducted an online survey with 201 DHH participants. The survey explores how demographic factors affect perceptions of sound awareness technologies  gauges interest in specific sounds and sound characteristics  solicits reactions to three design scenarios (smartphone  smartwatch  head-mounted display) and two output modalities (visual  haptic)  and probes issues related to social context of use. While most participants were highly interested in being aware of sounds  this interest was modulated by communication preference--that is  for sign or oral communication or both. Almost all participants wanted both visual and haptic feedback and 75% preferred to have that feedback on separate devices (e.g.  haptic on smartwatch  visual on head-mounted display). Other findings related to sound type  full captions vs. keywords  sound filtering  notification styles  and social context provide direct guidance for the design of future mobile and wearable sound awareness systems.
Exploring Sound Awareness in the Home for People who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Dhruv Jain  University of Washington Angela Carey Lin  University of Washington Rose Guttman  University of Washington Marcus Amalachandran  University of Washington Aileen Zeng  University of Washington Leah Findlater  University of Washington Jon E. Froehlich  University of Washington,The home is filled with a rich diversity of sounds from mundane beeps and whirs to dog barks and children's shouts. In this paper  we examine how deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people think about and relate to sounds in the home  solicit feedback and reactions to initial domestic sound awareness systems  and explore potential concerns. We present findings from two qualitative studies: in Study 1  12 DHH participants discussed their perceptions of and experiences with sound in the home and provided feedback on initial sound awareness mockups. Informed by Study 1  we designed three tablet-based sound awareness prototypes  which we evaluated with 10 DHH participants using a Wizard-of-Oz approach. Together  our findings suggest a general interest in smarthome-based sound awareness systems particularly for displaying contextually aware  personalized and glanceable visualizations but key concerns arose related to privacy  activity tracking  cognitive overload  and trust.
Social  Cultural and Systematic Frustrations Motivating the Formation of a DIY Hearing Loss Hacking Community,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Aisling Ann O'Kane  University of Bristol Abdinasir Aliomar  University College London Rebecca Zheng  University College London Britta F. Schulte  University College London Gianluca Trombetta  Hearing Hacks,Research on attitudes to assistive technology (AT) has shown both the positive and negative impact of these technologies on quality of life. Building on this research  we examine the sociocultural and technological frustrations with hearing loss (HL) technologies that motivate personal approaches to solving these issues. Drawing on meet-up observations and contextual interview data  we detail participants' experiences of and attitudes towards hearing AT that influences hacking hearing loss. Hearing AT is misunderstood as a solution to the impairment  influencing one-to-one interactions  cultural norms  and systematic frustrations. Participants' exasperation with the slow development of top-down solutions has led some members to design and develop their own personalised solutions. Beyond capturing a segment of the growing DIY health and wellbeing phenomenon  our findings extend beyond implications for design to present recommendations for the hearing loss industry  policy makers  and importantly  for researchers engaging with grassroots DIY health movements.
Changing Perspective: A Co-Design Approach to Explore Future Possibilities of Divergent Hearing,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Judith Dörrenbächer  University of Siegen Marc Hassenzahl  University of Siegen,Conventional hearing aids frame hearing impairment almost exclusively as a problem. In the present paper  we took an alternative approach by focusing on positive future possibilities of 'divergent hearing'. To this end  we developed a method to speculate simultaneously about not-yet-experienced positive meanings and not-yet-existing technology. First  we gathered already existing activities in which divergent hearing was experienced as an advantage rather than as a burden. These activities were then condensed into 'Prompts of Positive Possibilities' (PPP)  such as "Creating a shelter to feel safe in". In performative sessions  participants were given these PPPs and 'Open Probes' to enact novel everyday activities. This led to 26 possible meanings and according devices  such as "Being able to listen back into the past with a rewinder". The paper provides valuable insights into the interests and expectations of people with divergent hearing as well as a methodological contribution to a possibility-driven design.
The Right to the Sustainable Smart City,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Sara Heitlinger  City  University of London Nick Bryan-Kinns  Queen Mary University of London Rob Comber  KTH Royal Institute of Technology,Environmental concerns have driven an interest in sustainable smart cities  through the monitoring and optimisation of networked infrastructures. At the same time  there are concerns about who these interventions and services are for  and who benefits. HCI researchers and designers interested in civic life have started to call for the democratisation of urban space through resistance and political action to challenge state and corporate claims. This paper contributes to an emerging body of work that seeks to involve citizens in the design of sustainable smart cities  particularly in the context of marginalised and culturally diverse urban communities. We present a study involving co-designing Internet of Things with urban agricultural communities and discuss three ways in which design can participate in the right to the sustainable smart city through designing for the commons  care  and biocultural diversity.
Symbiotic Encounters: HCI and Sustainable Agriculture,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Szu-Yu (Cyn) Liu  Indiana University Shaowen Bardzell  Indiana University Jeffrey Bardzell  Indiana University,Recent sustainable HCI research has advocated "working with nature" as a potentially efficacious alternative to human efforts to control it: yet it is less clear how to do so. We contribute to the theoretical aspect of this research by presenting an ethnographic study on alternative farming practices  in which the farm is not so much a system but an assemblage characterized by multiple systems or rationalities always evolving and changing. In them  relationships among species alternate between mutually beneficial in one moment (or season)  and harmful in the next. If HCI is to participate in and to support working with nature  we believe that it will have to situate itself within such assemblages and temporalities. In this work  we look into nontraditional users (e.g.  nonhumans) and emerging forms of uses (e.g.  interactions between human and other species) to help open a design space for technological interventions. We offer three ethnographic accounts in which farmers—and ourselves as researchers—learn to notice  respond  and engage in symbiotic encounters with companion species and the living soil itself.
Sharing Economy Design Cards,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Anton Fedosov  Università della Svizzera italiana Masako Kitazaki  Fuji Xerox Co.  Ltd. William Odom  Simon Fraser University Marc Langheinrich  Università della Svizzera italiana,Sharing economy services have become increasingly popular. In addition to various well-known for-profit activities in this space (e.g.  ride and apartment sharing)  many community groups and non-profit organizations offer collections of shared things (e.g.  books  tools) that explicitly aim to benefit local communities. We expect that both non-profit and for-profit approaches will see an increased use in the future. To support designers in devising new sharing economy services  we developed the Sharing Economy Design Cards  a design toolkit in the form of a card deck. We present two deployments of the cards: (1) in individual interviews with 16 designers and sharing economy domain experts; and (2) in two workshops with 5 participants each. Our findings show that the use of the cards not only facilitates the creation of future sharing platforms and services in a collaborative setting  but also helps to evaluate existing sharing economy services as an individual activity.
Assisted Shifting of Electricity Use: A Long-Term Study of Managing Residential Heating ,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Rikke Hagensby Jensen  The Technical Faculty of IT and Design Jesper Kjeldskov  Aalborg University Mikael B. Skov  Aalborg University,Shifting is an energy-conserving interaction strategy for moving energy consumption to times where it is sustainably favorable. This interaction strategy is attracting increasing interest within sustainable HCI studies. While most of these consider how interactive technology can change household behavior  only a few report on how shifting is experienced in everyday life when assisted by automation. In this study  we investigate an interactive technology that assists households to shift electricity consumption to times when electricity is cheap or more sustainable. Our study was conducted as a long-term field deployment for 6-18 months with eight households  each living with an interactive prototype that shifts running times for a heat pump within user-defined boundaries. Our findings show that managing heat pumps toward assisted shifting was well-received by all households because it was a convenient way to shift electricity consumption. Shifting electricity use facilitated price savings of 6.8-16.9%. Nevertheless  our findings also reveal a conflict between the system design  and how householders actually interact with their heating system and experience assisted shifting. Based on the eight households' experiences  we present three overall themes of convenience  control  and complexity that each describes different aspects of long-term real-life use of automatic technology assisting households to shift electricity use. We discuss the broader implications of these findings and the role of design and future sustainability technology in everyday life.
Avoiding and Mitigating Ethical Traps in Technocentric Fieldwork,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto Mississauga Roisin McNaney  Bristol University Jenny Waycott  The University of Melbourne,We are witnessing an increase in fieldwork within the field of HCI  particularly involving marginalized or under-represented populations. This has posed ethical challenges for researchers during such field studies  with "ethical traps" not always identified during planning stages. This is often aggravated by the inconsistent policy guidelines  training  and application of ethical principles. We ground this in our collective experiences with ethically-difficult research  and frame it within common principles that are common across many disciplines and policy guidelines – representative of the instructors' diverse and international backgrounds.
Building Economic Models of Human Computer Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Leif Azzopardi  University of Strathclyde Guido Zuccon  University of Queensland,Economics provides an intuitive and natural way to formally represent the cost and benefits of interacting with applications  interfaces and devices. By using economics models it is possible to reason about interaction and make predictions about how changes to the system will affect performance and behavior. In this course  we provided an overview of relevant economic concepts and then showed how economics can be used to model human computer interaction to generated hypotheses about interaction which can be used to inform design and guide experimentation. As a case study  we demonstrate how various interactions with search and recommender applications can be modeled  before concluding the day with a hands-on modeling session using example and participant problems.
Tangible Ecosystem Design – Developing Disruptive Services for Digital Ecosystems,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Claudia Nass Bauer  Fraunhofer IESE Marcus Trapp  Fraunhofer IESE,The epoch of the platform economy has arrived. Companies face the question of how to build up disruptive digital services with disruptive business models and establish a digital ecosystem. Traditional UCD methods concentrate on the conception of particular services. Nevertheless  most of these are isolated solutions of single companies. Building services for the digital transformation era requires additional methods to come up with end-to-end consumer experiences and sustainable business models across boundaries of single companies for benefiting consumers. In this course participants learn the "Tangible Ecosystem Design" Method (TED)  that supports the conception of Digital Ecosystems by using tangible elements.
PinchList: Leveraging Pinch Gestures for Hierarchical List Navigation on Smartphones,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Teng Han  University of Manitoba Jie Liu  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences Khalad Hasan  University of British Columbia - Okanagan Mingming Fan  University of Toronto Junhyeok Kim  University of Manitoba Jiannan Li  University of Toronto Xiangmin Fan  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences Feng Tian  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences Edward Lank  University of Waterloo Pourang Irani  University of Manitoba,Intensive exploration and navigation of hierarchical lists on smartphones can be tedious and time-consuming as it often requires users to frequently switch between multiple views. To overcome this limitation  we present PinchList  a novel interaction design that leverages pinch gestures to support seamless exploration of multi-level list items in hierarchical views. With PinchList  sub-lists are accessed with a pinch-out gesture whereas a pinch-in gesture navigates back to the previous level. Additionally  pinch and flick gestures are used to navigate lists consisting of more than two levels. We conduct a user study to refine the design parameters of PinchList such as a suitable item size  and quantitatively evaluate the target acquisition performance using pinch-in/out gestures in both scrolling and non-scrolling conditions. In a second study  we compare the performance of PinchList in a hierarchal navigation task with two commonly used touch interfaces for list browsing: pagination and expand-and-collapse interfaces. The results reveal that PinchList is significantly faster than other two interfaces in accessing items located in hierarchical list views. Finally  we demonstrate that PinchList enables a host of novel applications in list-based interaction?
ForceRay: Extending Thumb Reach via Force Input Stabilizes Device Grip for Mobile Touch Input,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Christian Corsten  RWTH Aachen University Marcel Lahaye  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University,Smartphones are used predominantly one-handed  using the thumb for input. Many smartphones  however  have grown beyond 5". Users cannot tap everywhere on these screens without destabilizing their grip. ForceRay (FR) lets users aim at an out-of-reach target by applying a force touch at a comfortable thumb location  casting a virtual ray towards the target. Varying pressure moves a cursor along the ray. When reaching the target  quickly lifting the thumb selects it. In a first study  FR was 195 ms slower and had a 3% higher selection error than the best existing technique  BezelCursor (BC)  but FR caused significantly less device movement than all other techniques  letting users maintain a steady grip and removing their concerns about device drops. A second study showed that an hour of training speeds up both BC and FR  and that both are equally fast for targets at the screen border.
Sensing Posture-Aware Pen+Touch Interaction on Tablets,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Yang Zhang  Microsoft Research & Carnegie Mellon University Michel Pahud  Microsoft Research Christian Holz  Microsoft Research Haijun Xia  Microsoft Research & University of Toronto Gierad Laput  Microsoft Research & Carnegie Mellon University Michael McGuffin  Microsoft Research & École de Technologie Supérieure Xiao Tu  Microsoft Research Andrew Mittereder  Microsoft Research Fei Su  Microsoft Research William Buxton  Microsoft Research Ken Hinckley  Microsoft Research,Many status-quo interfaces for tablets with pen + touch input capabilities force users to reach for device-centric UI widgets at fixed locations  rather than sensing and adapting to the user-centric posture. To address this problem  we propose sensing techniques that transition between various nuances of mobile and stationary use via postural awareness. These postural nuances include shifting hand grips  varying screen angle and orientation  planting the palm while writing or sketching  and detecting what direction the hands approach from. To achieve this  our system combines three sensing modalities: 1) raw capacitance touchscreen images  2) inertial motion  and 3) electric field sensors around the screen bezel for grasp and hand proximity detection. We show how these sensors enable posture-aware pen+touch techniques that adapt interaction and morph user interface elements to suit fine-grained contexts of body-  arm-  hand-  and grip-centric frames of reference.
Typing on Split Keyboards with Peripheral Vision,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Yiqin Lu  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Chun Yu  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Shuyi Fan  Tsinghua University Xiaojun Bi  Stony Brook University Yuanchun Shi  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education,Split keyboards are widely used on hand-held touchscreen devices (e.g.  tablets). However  typing on a split keyboard often requires eye movement and attention switching between two halves of the keyboard  which slows users down and increases fatigue. We explore peripheral typing  a superior typing mode in which a user focuses her visual attention on the output text and keeps the split keyboard in peripheral vision. Our investigation showed that peripheral typing reduced attention switching  enhanced user experience and increased overall performance (27 WPM  28% faster) over the typical eyes-on typing mode. This typing mode can be well supported by accounting the typing behavior in statistical decoding. Based on our study results  we have designed GlanceType  a text entry system that supported both peripheral and eyes-on typing modes for real typing scenario. Our evaluation showed that peripheral typing not only well co-existed with the existing eyes-on typing  but also substantially improved the text entry performance. Overall  peripheral typing is a promising typing mode and supporting it would significantly improve the text entry performance on a split keyboard.
Empowerment on the Margins: The Online Experiences of Community Health Workers,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Azra Ismail  Georgia Institute of Technology Neha Kumar  Georgia Institute of Technology,Research in Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) routinely relies on and engages with the increasing penetration of smartphones and the internet. We examine the mobile  internet  and social media practices of women community health workers  for whom internet access has newly become possible. These workers are uniquely positioned at the intersections of various communities of practice---their familial units  workplaces  networks of health workers  larger communities  and the online world. However  they remain at the margins of each  on account of difference in gender  class  literacies  professional expertise  and more. Our findings unpack the legitimate peripheral participation of these workers; examining how they appropriate smartphones and the internet to move away from the peripheries to fully participate in these communities. We discuss how their activities are motivated by moves towards empowerment  digitization  and improved healthcare provision. We consider how future work might support  leverage  and extend their efforts.
Who Gets to Future? Race  Representation  and Design Methods in Africatown,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Jasper Tran O'Leary  University of Washington Sara Zewde  Studio Zewde Jennifer Mankoff  University of Washington Daniela K. Rosner  University of Washington,This paper draws on a collaborative project called the Africatown Activation to examine the role design practices play in contributing to (or conspiring against) the flourishing of the Black community in Seattle  Washington. Specifically  we describe the efforts of a community group called Africatown to design and build an installation that counters decades of disinvestment and ongoing displacement in the historically Black Central Area neighborhood. Our analysis suggests that despite efforts to include community  conventional design practices may perpetuate forms of institutional racism: enabling activities of community engagement that may further legitimate racialized forms of displacement. We discuss how focusing on amplifying the legacies of imagination already at work may help us move beyond a simple reading of design as the solution to systemic forms of oppression.
The Parenting Actor-Network of Latino Immigrants in the United States,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Marisol Wong-Villacres  Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral & Georgia Institute of Technology Neha Kumar  Georgia Institute of Technology Betsy DiSalvo  Georgia Institute of Technology,The field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has shown a growing interest in how technology might support parenting. An area that remains underexplored is the design of technology to support parents from nondominant groups in positively impacting their children's education. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory (ANT)  our paper takes a sociotechnical view of low-income Latino Spanish-speaking immigrants in the U.S.---a large nondominant group---attempting to form alliances with other actors such as teachers  the broader community  and technology to exchange information that might enrich their children's education. The use of ANT allowed us to advance work on parenting in HCI by providing a deeper understanding of the reasons---including attributes embedded in technology---impacting the quality of information channels in the parental engagement network of a nondominant group. Further  our ANT analysis illuminates a discussion of challenges and opportunities for technology to intervene in the network in ways that align with all actors' needs and harness their potentialities.
Guerilla Warfare and the Use of New (and Some Old) Technology: Lessons from FARC's Armed Struggle in Colombia,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Débora de Castro Leal  University of Siegen Max Krüger  University of Siegen Kaoru Misaki  International Institute of Socio-Informatics David Randall  University of Siegen Volker Wulf  University of Siegen,Studying armed political struggles from a CSCW perspective can throw the complex interactions between culture  technology  materiality and political conflict into sharp relief. Such studies highlight interrelations that otherwise remain under-remarked upon  despite their severe consequences. The present paper provides an account of the armed struggle of one of the Colombian guerrillas  FARC-EP  with the Colombian army. We document how radio-based communication became a crucial  but ambiguous infrastructure of war. The sudden introduction of localization technologies by the Colombian army presented a lethal threat to the guerrilla group. Our interviewees report a severe learning process to diminish this new risk  relying on a combination of informed beliefs and significant technical understanding. We end with a discussion of the role of HCI in considerations of ICT use in armed conflicts and introduce the concept of counter-appropriation as process of adapting one's practices to other's appropriation of technology in conflict.
'Think secure from the beginning': A Survey with Software Developers,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Hala Assal  Carleton University Sonia Chiasson  Carleton University,Vulnerabilities persist despite existing software security initiatives and best practices. This paper focuses on the human factors of software security  including human behaviour and motivation. We conducted an online survey to explore the interplay between developers and software security processes  e.g.  we looked into how developers influence and are influenced by these processes. Our data included responses from 123 software developers currently employed in North America who work on various types of software applications. Whereas developers are often held responsible for security vulnerabilities  our analysis shows that the real issues frequently stem from a lack of organizational or process support to handle security throughout development tasks. Our participants are self-motivated towards software security  and the majority did not dismiss it but identified obstacles to achieving secure code. Our work highlights the need to look beyond the individual  and take a holistic approach to investigate organizational issues influencing software security.
"If you want  I can store the encrypted password": A Password-Storage Field Study with Freelance Developers,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Alena Naiakshina  University of Bonn Anastasia Danilova  University of Bonn Eva Gerlitz  University of Bonn Emanuel von Zezschwitz  University of Bonn & Fraunhofer FKIE Matthew Smith  University of Bonn & Fraunhofer FKIE,In 2017 and 2018  Naiakshina et al. (CCS'17  SOUPS'18) studied in a lab setting whether computer science students need to be told to write code that stores passwords securely. The authors' results showed that  without explicit prompting  none of the students implemented secure password storage. When asked about this oversight  a common answer was that they would have implemented secure storage - if they were creating code for a company. To shed light on this possible confusion  we conducted a mixed-methods field study with developers. We hired freelance developers online and gave them a similar password storage task followed by a questionnaire to gain additional insights into their work. From our research  we offer two contributions. First of all  we reveal that  similar to the students  freelancers do not store passwords securely unless prompted  they have misconceptions about secure password storage  and they use outdated methods. Secondly  we discuss the methodological implications of using freelancers and students in developer studies.
Security Managers Are Not The Enemy Either,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Lena Reinfelder  Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg Robert Landwirth  Technical University Darmstadt & Fraunhofer SIT Zinaida Benenson  Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Security managers are leading employees whose decisions shape security measures and thus influence the everyday work of all users in their organizations. To understand how security managers handle user requirements and behavior  we conducted semi-structured interviews with seven security managers from large-scale German companies. Our results indicate that due to the absence of organizational structures that include users into security development processes  security managers unintentionally obtain a negative view on users. Their distrust towards users leads to the creation of technical security measures that cannot be influenced by users in any way. However  as previous research has repeatedly shown  rigid security measures lead to frustration and discouragement of users  and also to creative (but usually insecure) methods of security circumvention. We conclude that in order to break through this vicious cycle  security managers need organizational structures  methods and tools that facilitate systematic feedback from users.
Privacy  Anonymity  and Perceived Risk in Open Collaboration: A Study of Service Providers,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Nora McDonald  Drexel University Benjamin Mako Hill  University of Washington Rachel Greenstadt  New York University Andrea Forte  Drexel University,Anonymity can enable both healthy online interactions like support-seeking and toxic behaviors like hate speech. How do online service providers balance these threats and opportunities? This two-part qualitative study examines the challenges perceived by open collaboration service providers in allowing anonymous contributions to their projects. We interviewed eleven people familiar with organizational decisions related to privacy and security at five open collaboration projects and followed up with an analysis of public discussions about anonymous contribution to Wikipedia. We contrast our findings with prior work on threats perceived by project volunteers and explore misalignment between policies aiming to serve contributors and the privacy practices of contributors themselves.

Pictorial System Usability Scale (P-SUS): Developing an Instrument for Measuring Perceived Usability,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 11:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 12:20,Forth,Juergen Baumgartner  University of Fribourg & Puzzle ITC Naomi Frei  University of Fribourg Mascha Kleinke  University of Fribourg Juergen Sauer  University of Fribourg Andreas Sonderegger  EPFL,We have developed a pictorial multi-item scale  called P-SUS (Pictorial System Usability Scale)  which aims to measure the perceived usability of mobile devices. The scale is based on the established verbal usability questionnaire SUS (System Usability Scale). A user-centred design process was employed to develop and refine its 10 pictorial items. The scale was tested in a first validation study (N=60) using student participants. Psychometric properties (convergent validity  criterion-related validity  sensitivity  and reliability)  as well as the motivation to fill in the scale were assessed. The results indicated satisfactory convergent validity for about two-thirds of the items. Furthermore  strong correlations were obtained for the sum scores between verbal and pictorial SUS  and the pictorial scale was perceived as more motivating than the verbal questionnaire. The P-SUS represents a first attempt to provide a pictorial usability scale for the evaluation of (mobile) devices.

To improve beverage experience  electrical stimulation has been indicated as a method for changing a beverage's taste. However  the taste of a beverage changes temporally—a beverage's taste during drinking is different from its taste after swallowing. There are methods of evaluating the taste of a beverage based on time-series  such as the Time-Intensity (TI) method and the Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) method. Therefore  it is important to focus on the temporal change in a beverage's taste for improving the beverage experience. Thus  we focused on the taste before and after swallowing as a first step. Based on this review  we propose the concept of controlling the temporal change of a beverage's taste using electrical stimulation.

In the light of the many calls for explaining reasoning of interactive intelligent systems to users  we investigate whether this effect holds true for human-computer interaction. Using a prototype of a nutrition recommender  we conducted a lab study (N=30) between three groups (no explanation  placebic explanation  and real explanation). Our results indicate that placebic explanations for algorithmic decision-making may indeed invoke perceived levels of trust similar to real explanations. We discuss how placebic explanations could be considered in future work.
LBW0244: Can Privacy-Aware Lifelogs Alter Our Memories?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Passant Elagroudy  University of Stuttgart Mohamed Khamis  University of Glasgow Florian Mathis  LMU Munich Diana Irmscher  LMU Munich Andreas Bulling  University of Stuttgart Albrecht Schmidt  LMU Munich,The abundance of automatically-triggered lifelogging cameras is a privacy threat to bystanders. Countering this by deleting photos limits relevant memory cues and the informative content of lifelogs. An alternative is to obfuscate bystanders  but it is not clear how this impacts the lifelogger's recall of memories. We report on a study in which we compare viewing 1) unaltered photos  2) photos with blurred people  and 3) a subset of the photos after deleting private ones  on memory recall. Findings show that obfuscated content helps users recall a lot of content  but it also results in recalling less accurate details  which can sometimes mislead the user. Our work informs the design of privacy-aware lifelogging systems that maximizes recall and steers discussion about ubiquitous technologies that could alter human memories.
LBW0245: Robots are Always Social: Robotic Movements are Automatically Interpreted as Social Cues,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Hadas Erel  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Tzachi Shem Tov  The Interdisciplinary Center(IDC) Herzliya Yoav Kessler  Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Oren Zuckerman  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya,Physical movement is a dominant element in robot behavior. We evaluate if robotic movements are automatically interpreted as social cues  even if the robot has no social role. 24 participants performed the Implicit Associations Test  classifying robotic gestures into direction categories ("to-front" or "to-back") and words into social categories (willingness or unwillingness for interaction). Our findings show that social interpretation of the robot's gestures is an automatic process. The implicit social interpretation influenced both classification tasks  and could not be avoided even when it decreased participant's performance. This effect is of importance for the HCI community as designers should consider  that even if a robot is not intended for social interaction (e.g. factory robot)  people will not be able to avoid interpreting its movement as social cues. Interaction designers should leverage this phenomenon and consider the social interpretation that will be automatically associated with their robots' movement.
LBW0246: The Role of HCI in Reproducible Science: Understanding  Supporting and Motivating Core Practices,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Sebastian S. Feger  LMU Munich & CERN Sünje Dallmeier-Tiessen  CERN Paweł W. Woźniak  Utrecht University Albrecht Schmidt  LMU Munich,The reproducibility crisis refers to the inability to reproduce scientific experiments and is one of science's great challenges. Alarming reports and growing public attention are leading to the development of services and tools that aim to support key reproducible practices. In the face of this rapid evolution  we envision the unique opportunity for Human-Computer Interaction to impact scientific practice through the systematic study of requirements and moderating effects of technology on research reproducibility. In this paper  we report on the current state of technological and human factors in reproducible science and present challenges and opportunities for both HCI researchers and practitioners to understand  support and motivate core practices.

McPherson  Queen Mary University of London,Disabled people face many barriers to access in all areas of life  including creative expression. With music making  a lack of accessible instruments can be a major barrier  as well as environmental factors. The Strummi is an accessible instrument based on the guitar  designed as a technology probe to explore the technical and cultural role of guitar-like design and interaction modality. We have been collaborating with Heart n Soul  an arts charity that works with young people and adults with learning disabilities. In this paper  we share findings from the first year of this collaboration  and reflect on the implications for doing HCI research with learning-disabled communities. We took a longitudinal  situated approach with an intentionally simple technology inspired by in the wild and technology probe methodologies  allowing for interest in the Strummi to grow organically.
LBW0248: Designing the Next Generation of Activity Trackers for Performance Sports: Insights from Elite Tennis Coaches,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Hayati Havlucu  Koç University Aykut Coşkun  Koç University Oğuzhan Özcan  Koç University,Wearable sport technologies and activity trackers help sportspeople by providing physiological information on their performance. However  professional sportspeople find this information irrelevant due to their high-performance training. They want these devices to provide real-time assistive feedback on their performance  despite the formidable limitations suggested by previous research on giving such feedback. On the other hand  sport coaches already give performance feedback to their sportspeople during their performance. We speculated that some of their approaches might give clues for designing activity trackers with useful real-time performance feedback. Consequently  we interviewed six elite tennis coaches to explore their approaches of communicating performance information to their players  during tennis games. In this paper  we discussed the findings by comparing them with related work and formed two design insights for giving real-time performance feedback that might lead to novel approaches for activity trackers.
LBW0249: DIY Community WiFi Networks: Insights on Participatory Design,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Michael Smyth  Edinburgh Napier University Ingi Helgason  Edinburgh Napier University,This paper presents a first version of a set of insights developed collaboratively by researchers during a three-year participatory design project spread across four European locations. The MAZI project explored potential uses of a "Do-It-Yourself" WiFi networking technology platform. Built using low-cost Raspberry Pi computer hardware and specially developed  open-source software  this toolkit has the potential to enable hyper-local applications and services to be developed and maintained within a host community for its own use. The nine insights are a distillation and articulation of the collective reflections of the project partners gained from their experiences of working in diverse settings with varied communities and stakeholders. In this paper  we discuss the reflective process  we present the insights to the CHI community in order to gain feedback  and we situate our findings within previous literature.

We used this method in the 'Empowering Hacks' project which gathered two non-academic individuals with disabilities (authors 2 & 3) and a non-disabled HCI researcher (author 1) around DIY/Making by  for and with people with disabilities. To collectively review the achievements and challenges we experienced in this project  we designed a timeline which allowed us to equally engage in reflective thinking and curatorial discussions on how to present and explain identified key moments. We see the instance of this co-created poster as an opportunity to discuss with the CHI-community the potential and relevance of including research participants in analysis processes.
LBW0252: Chats with Bots: Balancing Imitation and Engagement,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Andreea Muresan  University of Copenhagen Henning Pohl  University of Copenhagen,Advances in AI are paving the way towards more natural interactions  blurring the line between bot and human. We present findings from a two-week diary study exploring users' interactions with the chatbot Replika. In particular  we focus on how users anthropomorphize chatbots and how this influences their engagement. We find that failing to adhere to social norms and glaring signs of humanity leads to decreased engagement unless balanced appropriately.
LBW0253: Wake-Up Task: Understanding Users in Task-based Mobile Alarm App,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Kyue Taek Oh  Hanyang University Jaemyung Shin  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Jaejeung Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology In Suk Song  Hanyang University Uichin Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Eunil Park  Sungkyunkwan University Jinyoung Han  Hanyang University Minsam Ko  Hanyang University,Popular alarm apps are offering task-based alarms that do not allow the user to dismiss an alarm unless they complete a specific task (e.g.  solving math problems). Because such wake-up tasks cause discomforts  their usefulness and necessity could vary among individuals and their context. In this work  we aimed to understand the characteristics of Alarmy (task-based alarm app) users who (dis) likes wake-up task in terms of alarm set usage. We grouped 8 500 US users into three according to the proportion of the task selection and investigated group-wise usage differences. We found significant usage differences among the groups in terms of (1) set frequency  (2) set time  and (3) set consistency  possibly caused by consistent needs and task difficulty. The results suggest promising directions for inconvenient interaction and behavior change research.
LBW0254: Push Away the Smartphone: Investigating Methods to Counter Problematic Smartphone Use,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Charlie Pinder  Independent Researcher Jose Ignacio Rocca  Universidad ORT Uruguay Benjamin R. Cowan  University College Dublin Russell Beale  University of Birmingham,There is a growing need to support people to counter problematic smartphone use. We analyse related research in methods to address problematic usage and identify a research gap in off-device retraining. We ran a pilot to address this gap  targeting automatic approach biases for smartphones  delivered on a Tabletop surface. Our quantitative analysis (n=40) shows that self-report and response-time based measures of problematic smartphone usage diverge. We found no evidence that our intervention altered reaction time-based measures. We outline areas of discussion for further research in the field.
LBW0255: "I Almost Fell in Love with a Machine": Speaking with Computers Affects Self-disclosure,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Qian Yu  University of California  Berkeley Tonya Nguyen  University of California  Berkeley Soravis Prakkamakul  University of California  Berkeley Niloufar Salehi  University of California  Berkeley,Listening and speaking are tied to human experiences of closeness and trust. As voice interfaces gain mainstream popularity  we ask: is our relationship with technology that speaks with us fundamentally different from technology we use to read and type? In particular  will we disclose more about ourselves to computers that speak to us and listen to our answer? We examine this question through a controlled experiment where a conversational agent asked participants closeness-generating questions common in social psychology through either text-based or voice-based interfaces. We found that people skipped more invasive questions when reading-typing compared to speaking-listening. Surprisingly  typing in their answers seemed to increased the propensity for self-disclosure. This research has implications for the future design of voice-based conversational agents and deepens concerns of user privacy.
LBW0256: Go for GOLD: Investigating User Behaviour in Goal-Oriented Tasks,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Sarah Prange  University of Applied Sciences Munich & LMU Munich Daniel Buschek  LMU Munich Ken Pfeuffer  Bundeswehr University Munich Lukas Mecke  University of Applied Sciences Munich & LMU Munich Peter Ehrich  LMU Munich Jens Le  University of Applied Sciences Munich & Technical University of Munich Florian Alt  Bundeswehr University Munich,Building adaptive support systems requires a deep understanding of why users get stuck or face problems during a goal-oriented task and how they perceive such situations. To investigate this  we first chart a problem space  comprising different problem characteristics (complexity  time  available means  and consequences). Secondly  we map them to LEGO assembly tasks. We apply these in a lab study (N=22) equipped with several tracking technologies (i.e.  smartwatch sensors and an OptiTrack setup) to assess which problem characteristics lead to measurable consequences in user behaviour. Participants rated occurred problems after each task. With this work  we suggest first steps towards a) understanding user behaviour in problem situations and b) building upon this knowledge to inform the design of adaptive support systems. As a result  we provide the GOLD dataset (Goal-Oriented Lego Dataset) for further analysis.
LBW0257: Designing for Preregistration: A User-Centered Perspective,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Xiaoying Pu  University of Michigan Licheng Zhu  University of Michigan Matthew Kay  University of Michigan Frederick Conrad  University of Michigan,The replication crisis---a failure to replicate foundational studies---has sparked a conversation in psychology  HCI  and beyond about scientific reliability. To address the crisis  researchers increasingly adopt preregistration: the practice of documenting research plans before conducting a study. Done properly  preregistration should reduce bias from taking exploratory findings as confirmatory. It is crucial to treat preregistration  often an online form/template  as a user-centered design problem to ensure preregistration achieves its intended goal. To understand preregistration in practice  we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with preregistration users (researchers) who ranged in seniority and experience. We identified two main purposes researchers have for using preregistration  in addition to different user roles and adoption barriers. With the ultimate goal of improving the reliability of scientific findings  we suggest opportunities to explicitly support the different aspects of preregistration use based on our findings.
LBW0258: You Can't Go Your Own Way: Social Influences on Travelling Behavior,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Kevin Sanders  KU Leuven David Geerts  KU Leuven,Travel planning is increasingly done using assistive travel planning technologies. These technologies  however  tend to focus on the traveller as an individual  while travelling can often be a social endeavour involving other people. In order to explore the influence of other people on travelling behaviour  nineteen participants from the city of Ghent  Belgium  took part in a diary study and a subsequent interview. Our results show that the social context of certain travelling behaviours can influence the three main components that make up a displacement (i.e. the route  the departure time and the mode of transportation). Additionally  other aspects of the displacement  such as activities during the displacement  can also be influenced by a social travelling context. We propose that travel planning and travel assistance software could benefit from efforts to incorporate the social aspects of travelling into their systems and offer some suggestions.
LBW0259: Hyper Typer: A Serious Game for Measuring Mobile Text Entry Performance in the Wild,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Richard Schlögl  TU Wien Christoph Wimmer  TU Wien Thomas Grechenig  TU Wien,In this paper we introduce Hyper Typer  a serious Android game for collecting text entry performance data on a large scale in an unsupervised manner. Publishing the game on the Google Play Store resulted in a total of 1 917 usable transcribed phrases with 58 829 keystrokes over an eleven-week period. By analyzing the data  we demonstrate the feasibility of the method and give preliminary results regarding the overall performance and error rate of players. Moreover  the collected data allows us to compare two of the most commonly used Android soft-keyboards.
LBW0261: A/P(rivacy) Testing: Assessing Applications for Social and Institutional Privacy,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Oshrat Ayalon  Tel Aviv University Eran Toch  Tel Aviv University,The way information systems are designed has a crucial effect on users' privacy  but users are rarely involved in Privacy-by-Design processes. To bridge this gap  we investigate how User-Centered Design (UCD) methods can be used to improve the privacy of systems' designs. We present the process of developing A/P(rivacy) Testing  a platform that allows designers to compare several privacy designs alternatives  eliciting end-users' privacy perceptions of a tested system or a feature (Figure 1). We describe three online experiments  with 959 participants  in which we created and validated the reliability of a scale for Users' Perceived Systems' Privacy (UPSP)  and used it to compare between privacy designs alternatives by using scenarios and different variants. We show that A/B testing is applicable for privacy purposes and that our scale is differentiating between designs that perceived as legitimate and designs that may violate users' expectations.
LBW0262: HappyPermi: Presenting Critical Data Flows in Mobile Application to Raise User Security Awareness,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Mehrdad Bahrini  University of Bremen Nina Wenig  University of Bremen Marcel Meissner  University of Bremen Karsten Sohr  University of Bremen Rainer Malaka  University of Bremen,Malicious Android applications can obtain user's private data and silently send it to a server. Android permissions are currently not sufficient enough to ensure the security of users' sensitive information. For a sufficient permission model it is important to account the target of the outgoing data flow. On the other hand  permission dialogues often contain relevant information  but most of the users generally do not understand the implications or the visualization fails to guide the user attention to it. It is important to empower users by providing applications that show them who can access their private data and who might send this data to the outside. In order to raise user awareness considering Android permissions  we developed HappyPermi  an application that visualizes which user information is accessible by the granted permissions. Our evaluation (n=20) shows that most users are not aware of the sensitive data that their installed applications have access to. Our results suggest how different users feel about accessing their sensitive data when they are aware of its outgoing destinations.
LBW0264: Towards a Graph of (American) Tech Companies: A Prototype Visualization Tool for Research on Technology and Users,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Niel Chah  University of Toronto,A number of large technology companies  or so-called "tech giants"  such as Alphabet/Google  Amazon  Apple  Facebook  and Microsoft  are increasingly dominant in people's daily lives  and critically studied in fields such as Science  Technology and Society (STS) studies  with an emphasis on technology  data  and privacy. This project aims to contribute to research at the intersection of technology and society with a prototype visualization tool that shows the vast spread and scope of these large technology companies. In this paper  a prototype graph visualization of notable American technology companies  their acquisitions  and services is presented. The potential applications and limitations of the visualization tool for research are explored. This is followed by a discussion of applying the visualization tool to research on personal data and privacy concerns and possible extensions. In particular  difficulties of data collection and representation are emphasized.
LBW0265: Engaging Users with Educational Games: The Case of Phishing,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Matt Dixon  Northumbria University Nalin Asanka Gamagedara Arachchilage  University of New South Wales James Nicholson  Northumbria University,Phishing continues to be a difficult problem for individuals and organisations. Educational games and simulations have been increasingly acknowledged as versatile and powerful teaching tools  yet little work has examined how to engage users with these games. We explore this problem by conducting workshops with 9 younger adults and reporting on their expectations for cybersecurity educational games. We find a disconnect between casual and serious gamers  where casual gamers prefer simple games incorporating humour while serious gamers demand a congruent narrative or storyline. Importantly  both demographics agree that educational games should prioritise gameplay over information provision -- i.e. the game should be a game with educational content. We discuss the implications for educational games developers.
LBW0266: Metro-Viz: Black-Box Analysis of Time Series Anomaly Detectors,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Philipp Eichmann  Brown University Franco Solleza  Brown University Junjay Tan  Brown University Nesime Tatbul  Intel Research & Massachusetts Institute of Technology Stan Zdonik  Brown University,Millions of time-based data streams (a.k.a.  time series) are being recorded every day in a wide-range of industrial and scientific domains  from healthcare and finance to autonomous driving. Detecting anomalous behavior in such streams has become a common analysis task for which data scientists employ complex machine learning models. Analyzing the behavior and performance of these models is a challenge on its own. While traditional accuracy metrics (e.g.  precision/recall) are often used in practice to measure and compare the performance of different anomaly detectors  such statistics alone are insufficient to characterize and compare the algorithms in a systematic  human-interpretable way. In this extended abstract  we present Metro-Viz  a visual analysis tool to help data scientists and domain experts reason about commonalities and differences among anomaly detectors  and to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
LBW0267: Using a Game to Explore Notions of Responsibility for Cyber Security in Organisations,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Dorota Filipczuk  University of Southampton Charles Mason  University of Southampton Stephen Snow  University of Southampton,Improving the cyber literacy of employees reduces a company's risk of cyber security breach. Game-based methods are found to be more effective in teaching users how to avoid fraudulent phishing links than traditional learning material such as videos and text. This paper reports on the development of a mobile app designed to improve cyber literacy and provoke users' perceptions of who is responsible for cyber security in organisations. Based on a preliminary trial with 17 participants  we investigated users perceptions of a tongue-in-cheek  provocative cyber security awareness game where users' jobs depend on their aptitude for protecting their organisations' cyber security. Findings suggest that users accepted the high responsibility levelled upon them in the game and that ludic elements hold promise for engagement and increasing users' cyber awareness.
LBW0268: PaxVis: Visualizing Peace Agreements,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Lucy Havens  University of Edinburgh Mengting Bao  University of Edinburgh Larissa Pschetz  University of Edinburgh Benjamin Bach  University of Edinburgh Christine Bell  The University of Edinburgh,Peace is a universal concern involving a complex process of negotiations between select groups (i.e. policy makers  mediators  scholars and civil society groups). In this paper we present PaxVis  a platform of two interactive data visualizations for a large database of peace agreements (PA-X). We developed PaxVis to support comparative analysis of peace processes and to improve understandings of the complex dynamics behind the establishment of peace.
LBW0269: What is 'Cyber Security'? Differential Language of Cyber Security Across the Lifespan,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Simon L. Jones  University of Bath Emily I. M. Collins  University of Bath Ana Levordashka  University of Bath Kate Muir  University of Bath Adam Joinson  University of Bath,People experience and understand cyber security differently. Our ongoing work aims to address the fundamental challenge of how we can understand a diverse range of cyber security experiences  attitudes and behaviours in order to design better  more effective cyber security services and educational materials. In this paper  we take a lifespan approach to study the language of cyber security across three main life stages - young people  working age  and older people. By applying text feature extraction and analysis techniques to lists of cyber security features generated by each age group  we illustrate the differential language of cyber security across the lifespan and discuss the implications for design and research in HCI.
LBW0271: "Jack-of-All-Trades": A Thematic Analysis of Conversational Agents in Multi-Device Collaboration Contexts,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Yoonjeong Cha  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Jincheul Jang  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Younghyun Hong  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Mun Yong Yi  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,A growing number of conversational agents are being embedded into larger systems such as smart homes. However  little attention has been paid to the user interactions with conversational agents in the multi-device collaboration context (MDCC)  where a multiple number of devices are connected to accomplish a common mission. The objective of this study is to identify the roles of conversational agents in the MDCC. Toward this goal  we conducted semi-structured interviews with nine participants who are heavy users of smart speakers connected with home IoT devices. We collected 107 rules (usage instances) and asked benefits and limitations of using those rules. Our thematic analysis has found that  while the smart speakers perform the role of voice controller in the single device context  their role extended to automation hub  reporter  and companion in the MDCC. Based on the findings  we provide design implications for smart speakers in the MDCC.
LBW0272: A Preliminary Study of the Role of Language in Home Network Troubleshooting,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Amy Csizmar Dalal  Carleton College Jackie Chan  Carleton College Kirby Mitchell  Carleton College,We present the results of a preliminary study into the usability of troubleshooting terminology around home computer networks. Forty-seven participants classified 29 terms  selected from interview transcripts and online help forums  in an open card sort. We analyzed words participants explicitly indicated as unfamiliar as well as words that participants misclassified. The study serves as a proof of concept for a broader study to determine whether certain technical terms and/or their colloquial counterparts are understandable by technical novices and intermediates. Our findings indicate that participants found technical and colloquial terms equally problematic. These findings have implications for the design of troubleshooting tools and systems as well as the design of technical support scripts and training.
LBW0273: The Impact of "Cosmetic" Changes on the Usability of Error Messages,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Tao Dong  Google Kandarp Khandwala  University of California  San Diego & Google,Programmatic errors are often difficult to resolve due to poor usability of error messages. Applying theories of visual perception and techniques in visual design  we created three visual variants of a representative error message in a modern UI framework. In an online experiment  we found that the visual variants led to substantial improvements over the original error message in both error comprehension and resolution. Our results demonstrate that seemingly cosmetic changes to the presentation of an error message can have an oversized impact on its usability.
LBW0274: Bridging the Gap Between Business  Design and Product Metrics,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Ilias Flaounas  Atlassian Arik Friedman  Atlassian,The integration of User-Centered Design with Agile practices studies the interactions between designers and developers and the alignment of the design and development processes. However  beyond the interactions with the development team  designers are often required to operate within a wider business context  driven by goals set on high-level metrics  like Monthly Active Users  and to show how design-led initiatives and improvements address those metrics. In this paper we generalize learnings from prior work on applying usability improvements to Jira  a project tracking software tool created by Atlassian  and we describe a structured approach to bridging the gap between feature work and business metrics.
LBW0275: AR in the Gallery: The Psychogeographer's Table,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Juliano Franz  Dalhousie University Mohammed Alnusayri  Dalhousie University Joseph Malloch  Dalhousie University Akshay Gahlon  Dalhousie University Derek Reilly  Dalhousie University,In recent years  museums have embraced the use of digital technologies to add interactivity to exhibits. New tools such as wireless beacons  QR codes and markerless trackers paired with powerful smartphones are used to implement applications ranging from guides that provide supplementary material as web pages or audio to spatially precise augmented reality (AR). In this work we explore the use of head-mounted (rather than the more common hand-held) AR in a museum space. Our goal is to explore visitor behaviour when using such technology  to inform the design of a future longitudinal study. We found that visitors enjoyed their experience with head-mounted AR and learned fairly quickly how to navigate and interact with virtual content.
LBW0276: Let's Chat in Alipay: Understanding Social Function Usage in Task-oriented Apps,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Jiaojiao Fu  Fudan University & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing Yangfan Zhou  Fudan University & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing Shengnan Wu  Fudan University & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing Xin Wang  Fudan University & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing,Recently  many mobile apps start to incorporate social functions into their design  even for the task-oriented ones  i.e.  those designed mainly to help users complete certain tasks. For instance  Taobao  a shopping app  includes online-sharing and instant-messaging functions. However  there is still lack of research on how the users accept and use these social functions. This paper aims to unveil the user requirements on the social functions in task-oriented apps  and accordingly provide design suggestions for app developers. To this end  we conduct semi-structured interviews with 16 participants on how they use instant-messaging functions in three widely-used task-oriented apps  the shopping app Taobao  an online payment app Alipay  and an entertainment app NetEase Cloud Music. Our findings demonstrate that the instant-messaging functions in these apps are not widely accepted  although they benefit user experience and facilitate users' online social activities. We show that both the design and the users' stereotype towards the apps are important reasons. Finally  we suggest several design guidelines.
LBW0277: Magika  a Multisensory Environment for Play  Education and Inclusion,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Mirko Gelsomini  Politecnico di Milano Giulia Cosentino  Politecnico di Milano Micol Spitale  Politecnico di Milano & IBM Research Mattia Gianotti  Politecnico di Milano Davide Fisicaro  Politecnico di Milano Giulia Leonardi  Politecnico di Milano Fabiano Riccardi  Politecnico di Milano Agnese Piselli  Politecnico di Milano Eleonora Beccaluva  Politecnico di Milano Barbara Bonadies  Politecnico di Milano Lucia Di Terlizzi  Politecnico di Milano Martino Zinzone  Politecnico di Milano Shanti Alberti  Politecnico di Milano Christelle Rebourg  Politecnico di Milano Marina Carulli  Politecnico di Milano Franca Garzotto  Politecnico di Milano Venanzio Arquilla  Politecnico of Milan Mario Bisson  Politecnico di Milano Barbara Del Curto  Politecnico di Milano Monica Bordegoni  Politecnico di Milano,Magika is an interactive Multisensory Environment that enables new forms of playful interventions for children  especially those with Special Education Needs. Designed in cooperation with more than 30 specialists at local care centers and primary schools  Magika integrates digital worlds projected on the wall and the floor with a gamut of "smart" physical objects (toys  ambient lights  materials  and various connected appliances) to enable tactile  auditory  visual  and olfactory stimuli. The room is connected with an interface for educators that enables them to: control the level of stimuli and their progression; define and share a countless number of game-based learning activities; customize such activities to the evolving needs of each child. This paper describes Magika and discusses its potential benefits for play  education and inclusion.
LBW0278: One Metric for All: Calculating Interaction Effort of Individual Widgets,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Julián Grigera  LIFIA  Fac. de Informática  UNLP & CICPBA Juan Cruz Gardey  Universidad Nacional de La Plata Andrés Rodriguez  Universidad Nacional de La Plata Alejandra Garrido  Universidad Nacional de La Plata Gustavo Rossi  Universidad Nacional de La Plata,Automating usability diagnosis and repair can be a powerful assistance to usability experts and even less knowledgeable developers. To accomplish this goal  evaluating user interaction automatically is crucial  and it has been broadly explored. However  most works focus in long interaction sessions  which makes it difficult to tell how individual interface components influence usability. In contrast  this work aims to compare how different widgets perform for a same task  in the context of evaluating alternative designs for small components  implemented as refactorings. For this purpose  we propose a unified score to compare the widgets involved in each refactoring by the level of effort required by users to interact with them. This score is based on micro-measures automatically captured from interaction logs  so it can be automatically predicted. We show the results of predicting such score using decision trees.
LBW0279: Exploring Machine Teaching for Object Recognition with the Crowd,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Jonggi Hong  University of Maryland Kyungjun Lee  University of Maryland June Xu  University of Maryland Hernisa Kacorri  University of Maryland,Teachable interfaces can enable end-users to personalize machine learning applications by explicitly providing a few training examples. They promise higher robustness in the real world by significantly constraining conditions of the learning task to a specific user and their environment. While facilitating user control  their effectiveness can be hindered by lack of expertise or misconceptions. Through a mobile teachable testbed in Amazon Mechanical Turk  we explore how non-experts conceptualize  experience  and reflect on their engagement with machine teaching in the context of object recognition.
LBW0281: Negative Emotions  Positive Experience: What Are We Doing Wrong When Evaluating the UX?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Walter T. Nakamura  Federal University of Amazonas Elaine H. T. de Oliveira  Federal University of Amazonas Tayana Conte  Federal University of Amazonas,Since its idealization more than 20 years ago  much research has been carried out on the User eXperience (UX) field  with several evaluation methods being proposed. However  studies have been pointing out conflicting results when evaluating the UX. Users frequently evaluate their UX as positive  even when experiencing many negative emotions when interacting with a product. Moreover  variables such as the peak-end effect and the memory-experience gap may also have been influencing the results  leading to misinterpretations about the product's quality. In this context  this paper presents our work-in-progress research on the following research question: "What are we doing wrong when evaluating the UX?". We discuss about different variables that may have been influencing users' perceptions about their experiences in previous studies and highlight research opportunities. With this work  we expect to shed light on and bring reflection to current practices on UX evaluations in order to progress the research in the UX field.
LBW0282: Investigating the Role of User's English Language Proficiency in Using a Voice User Interface: A Case of Google Home Smart Speaker,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Aung Pyae  Swinburne University of Technology Paul Scifleet  Swinburne University of Technology,Amazon's Echo  and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups; however  these existing commercial VUIs support limited language options for users including native English speakers and non-native English speakers. Also  the existing literature about usability differences between these two distinct groups is limited. Thus  in this study  we conducted a usability study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 participants including native English and non-native English speakers to understand their differences in using the Google Home Smart Speaker. The findings show that compared with their counterparts  the native English speakers had better and more positive user experiences in interacting with the device. It also shows that users' English language proficiency plays an important role in interacting with VUIs. The findings from this study can create insights for VUI designers and developers for implementing multiple language options and better voice recognition algorithms in VUIs for different user groups across the world.
LBW0283: Invisible Touch: How Identifiable are Mid-Air Haptic Shapes?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Isa Rutten  KU Leuven William Frier  Ultrahaptics Lawrence Van den Bogaert  KU Leuven David Geerts  KU Leuven,Mid-air haptic feedback constitutes a new means of system feedback in which tactile sensations are created without contact with an actuator. Though earlier research has already focused on its abilities to enhance our experiences  e.g. by increasing a sense of immersion during art exhibitions  an elaborate study investigating people's abilities to identify different mid-air haptic shapes has not yet been conducted. In this paper  we describe a user study involving 50 participants  with ages between 19 – 77 years old  who completed a mid-air haptic learning experiment involving eight different mid-air haptic shapes. Preliminary results showed no learning effect throughout the task. Age was found to be strongly related to a decline in performance  and interestingly  significant differences in accuracy rates were found for different types of mid-air haptic shapes.
LBW0284: A Learning Design Framework to Support Children with Learning Disabilities Incorporating Gamification Techniques,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Adel Shaban  Teesside University Elaine Pearson  Teesside University,Gamification is increasingly being applied in education to engage and motivate learners. Yet the application of gaming elements can be problematic because it can have a negative effect on cognitive load (CL) and on working memory (WM). This is a particular issue for children with learning disabilities who suffer from deficits in working memory. While studies have explored the relationship between gamification and cognitive load  there is little research to address the management of cognitive load in gamified learning applications for children with learning disabilities. This study is suggesting a framework based on existing guidelines derived from HCI concepts and cognitive load theories to design user-centered gamified applications for children with learning disabilities to exploit their limited WM capacity and manage cognitive load.
LBW0285: Pseudo-haptic Controls for Mid-air Finger-based Menu Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Marco Speicher  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Jan Ehrlich  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Vito Gentile  Università degli Studi di Palermo Donald Degraen  Intel Visual Computing Institute (IVCI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Salvatore Sorce  Università degli Studi di Palermo Antonio Krüger  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus,Virtual Reality (VR) is more accessible than ever these days. While topics like performance  motion sickness and presence are well investigated  basic topics as VR User Interfaces (UIs) for menu control are lagging far behind. A major issue is the absence of haptic feedback and naturalness  especially when considering mid-air finger-based interaction in VR  when "grabbable" controllers are not available. In this work  we present and compare the following two visual approaches to mid-air finger-based menu control in VR environments: a planar UI similar to common 2D desktop UIs  and a pseudo-haptic UI based on physical metaphors. The results show that the pseudo-haptic UI performs better in terms of all tested aspects including workload  user experience  motion sickness and immersion.
LBW0286: Relax Yourself - Using Virtual Reality to Enhance Employees' Mental Health and Work Performance,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Carolin Straßmann  University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West Sabrina C. Eimler  University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West Alexander Arntz  University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West Dustin Keßler  University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West Sarah Zielinski  University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West Gabriel Brandenberg  University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West Vanessa Dümpel  University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West Uwe Handmann  University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West,This paper presents work-in-progress aiming to develop an actively adapting virtual reality (VR) relaxation application. Due to the immersive nature of VR technologies  people can escape from their real environment and get into a relaxing state. Goal of the application is to adapt to the users' physiological signals to foster the positive effect. Until now  a first version of the VR application was constructed and is currently evaluated in an experiment. Preliminary results of this study demonstrate that people appreciate the immersion into the virtual environment and escape from reality. Moreover  participants highlighted the option to adapt users' needs and preferences. Based on the final study data  the constructed application will be enhanced with regard to adoption and surrounding factors.
LBW0287: Digital Doctors and Robot Receptionists: User Attributes that Predict Acceptance of Automation in Healthcare Facilities,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Andrew Gambino  Penn State University Jinyoung Kim  Penn State University S. Shyam Sundar  Penn State University,Advances in artificial intelligence offer the promise of accessibility  precision  and personalized care in health settings. However  growth in technology has not translated to commensurate growth in automation of healthcare facilities. To gain a better understanding of user psychology behind the acceptance of automation in clinics  a 3 (Role: Receptionist  Nurse  Doctor) x 3 (Digital Agent Representation: Human  Avatar  Robot) factorial experiment (N = 283) was conducted. Results suggest that the digital nature of the interaction overpowers any individual role effects  with acceptance depending upon individual traits (belief in machine heuristic; power usage). Implications for theory and the design of digital healthcare facilities are discussed.
LBW0288: Effects of Visual Enhancements and Delivery Time on Receptivity of Mobile Push Notifications,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Ravit Avraham Bahir  Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Yisrael Parmet  Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Noam Tractinsky  Ben-Gurion University of the Negev,Using real-world logs from 6 866 users who received relevant smartphone notifications we show that visual elements in the notification influence its receptivity. Users responded significantly more to notifications that included an image or an icon compared to standard notifications and to notifications including an action button compared to those not including such button. In addition  timing of the notifications also had a significant effect on receptivity  with lower click rates during the morning hours and higher rates during the afternoon and evening hours.
LBW0289: CooperationCaptcha: On-The-Fly Object Labeling for Highly Automated Vehicles,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Marcel Walch  Ulm University Mark Colley  Ulm University Michael Weber  Ulm University,In the emerging field of automated vehicles (AVs)  the many recent advancements coincide with different areas of system limitations. The recognition of objects like traffic signs or traffic lights is still challenging  especially under bad weather conditions or when traffic signs are partially occluded. A common approach to deal with system boundaries of AVs is to shift to manual driving  accepting human factor issues like post-automation effects. We present CooperationCaptcha  a system that asks drivers to label unrecognized objects on the fly  and consequently maintain automated driving mode. We implemented two different interaction variants to work with object recognition algorithms of varying sophistication. Our findings suggest that this concept of driver-vehicle cooperation is feasible  provides good usability  and causes little cognitive load. We present insights and considerations for future research and implementations.
LBW1821: SoundGlance: Briefing the Glanceable Cues of Web Pages for Screen Reader Users,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Jaeyoon Song  Seoul National University Kiroong Choe  Seoul National University Jaemin Jo  Seoul National University Jinwook Seo  Seoul National University,Screen readers have become a core assistive technology for blind web users to browse web pages. Although screen readers can convey the textual information or structural properties of web pages  they cannot deliver their overall impression. Such a limitation hinders blind web users from obtaining an overview of the website  which non-blind people can do in a short time. As such  we present SoundGlance  a novel application that briefly delivers an auditory summary of web pages. SoundGlance supports the screen reader users by converting the important glanceable cues of the pages into sound. The feasibility of prototype was examined in a pilot study with fourteen blind people. Several practical insights were derived from the experiment.
LBW2110: On-road Stress Analysis for In-car Interventions During the Commute,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Stephanie Balters  Stanford University Madeline Bernstein  Stanford University Pablo E. Paredes  Stanford University,This paper focuses on the larger question of when to administer in-car just-in-time stress management interventions. We look at the influence of driving-related stress to find the right time to provide personalized and contextually-aware interventions. We address this challenge with a data driven approach that takes into consideration driving-induced stress  driver (cognitive) availability  and indicators of risky driving behavior such as lane departures and high steering reversal rates. We ran a study with sixteen commuters during morning and evening traffic while applying an in-situ experience sampling. During 45 minutes of driving through various scenarios including city  highway  and neighborhood roads we captured physiological measurements  video of participants and surroundings  and CAN bus driving data. Initial review of the data shows that stress levels changed greatly between 2 and 9 (out of a 0-min to 10-max scale). We conclude with a discussion on how to prepare the data to train supervised algorithms to find the right time to intervene stress while driving.

Landay  Stanford University Pablo E. Paredes  Stanford University,This is the first on-road study testing the efficacy and safety of guided slow breathing interventions in a car. This paper presents design and experimental implications when evolving from prior simulator to on-road scenarios. We ran a controlled study (N=40) testing a haptic guided breathing system in a closed circuit under stress and not-stressed driving conditions. Preliminary results validate prior findings about the efficacy and safety of the intervention. Initial qualitative analysis shows an overall positive acceptance  and no safety-critical incidents (e.g.  hard brakes or severe lane departures) -- all participants graded the intervention as safe for real traffic applications. Going further  additional analysis is needed before exposing commuters to the intervention on public roads.
LBW2112: The Effect of Rotational Jitter on 3D Pointing Tasks,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Anil Ufuk Batmaz  Simon Fraser University Wolfgang Stuerzlinger  Simon Fraser University,Even when in a static position  data acquired from 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) trackers is affected by noise  which is typically called jitter. In this study  we analyzed the effects of 3D rotational jitter on Virtual Reality (VR) controllers in a 3D Fitts' law experiment  which explored how such jitter affects user performance. Eight subjects performed a Fitts' law experiment with or without additional jitter on the cursor. Results show that while error rate significantly increased above ±0.5° jitter and subjects' effective throughput started to decrease significantly above ±1° jitter  there was no significant effect on users' movement time. Further  the Fitts's law movement time model was affected when ±2° jitter was applied to the tracker. According to these results  ±0.5° jitter on the controller does not significantly affect user performance for the tasks explored here. The results of our study can guide the design of 3D controller and tracking systems for 3D user interfaces.
LBW2113: Kirigami Keyboard: Inkjet Printable Paper Interface with Kirigami Structure Presenting Kinesthetic Feedback,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Zekun Chang  The University of Tokyo Heeju Kim  The University of Tokyo Kunihiro Kato  The University of Tokyo Kazuya Saito  Kyushu University Tung D. Ta  The University of Tokyo Weiwei Jiang  The University of Tokyo Koya Narumi  The University of Tokyo Yoshinobu Miyamoto  Aichi Institute of Technology Yoshihiro Kawahara  The University of Tokyo,We propose a DIY process to produce customized paper keyboards with kinesthetic feedback that interact with touchscreens. The process is built using two techniques: kirigami and printable double-layered circuits. Our goal is to improve the extensibility and usability of various interfaces made with 2D paper substrates. First  Our kirigami structures provide kinesthetic sensations whose z-directional key stroke is comparable to that of traditional keyboards. In order to design keys with appropriate stroke and reaction force  we adopted the Rotational Erection System (RES). Second  printable double-layered circuits allow users to easily adjust input layouts. This easy-to-customize keyboard can be especially useful for those who have specific requirements for input devices.
LBW2114: A Left-Hand Advantage: Motor Asymmetry in Touchless Input,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Pantea Habibi  University of Illinois at Chicago Debaleena Chattopadhyay  University of Illinois at Chicago,Touchless gesture is a common input type when interacting with large displays or virtual and augmented reality applications. In touchless input  users may alternate between hands or use bimanual gestures. But touchless performance in nondominant hands is little explored---even though cognitive science and neuroscience studies show cerebral hemispheric specialization causes performance differences between dominant and nondominant hands in lateralized individuals. Drawing on theories that account for between-hand differences in rapid-aimed movements  we characterize motor asymmetry in touchless input. Results from a controlled study (n = 20  right-handed) show freehand touchless input produces significantly smaller between-hand performance differences than a mouse in pointing and dragging. We briefly discuss the HCI implications of motor asymmetry in an input type.
LBW2115: Off-Surface Tangibles: Exploring the Design Space of Midair Tangible Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Christian Cherek  RWTH Aachen University David Asselborn  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,Tangibles on interactive tabletops are tracked by the surface they are placed on and have been shown to benefit the interaction. However  they are tied to the surface. When picked up  they are no longer recognized and lose any connection to virtual objects shown by the table. We introduce the interaction concept of Off-Surface Tangibles that are tracked by the surface but continue to support meaningful interactions when lifted off the surface. We present a design space for Off-Surface Tangibles  and design considerations when employing them. We populate the design space with prior work and introduce possible interaction designs for further research.
LBW2116: Overgrown: Supporting Plant Growth with an Endoskeleton for Ambient Notifications,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Donald Degraen  Intel Visual Computing Institute (IVCI) Felix Kosmalla  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) Antonio Krüger  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI),Ambient notifications are an essential element to support users in their daily activities. Designing effective and aesthetic notifications that balance the alert level while maintaining an unobtrusive dialog  require them to be seamlessly integrated into the user's environment. In an attempt to employ the living environment around us  we designed Overgrown  an actuated robotic structure capable of supporting a plant to grow over itself. As a plant endoskeleton  Overgrown aims to engage human empathy towards living creatures to increase effectiveness of ambient notifications while ensuring better integration with the environment. In a focus group  Overgrown was identified with having personality  showed potential as a user's ambient avatar  and was suited for social experiments.
LBW2117: Towards Data-Driven Sword Fighting Experiences in VR,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Javier Dehesa  University of Bath Andrew Vidler  Ninja Theory Ltd Christof Lutteroth  University of Bath Julian Padget  University of Bath,We present a data-driven animated character capable of blocking attacks from a user in a VR sword fighting experience. The system uses motion capture data and a machine learning model to recreate a believable blocking behaviour  suggesting the viability of full-featured data-driven interactive characters in VR. Our work is part of a larger vision of VR interaction as a two-level problem  separating spatial details from design concerns. In this context  here we provide the designers of the experience with a character from which a ''blocking'' behaviour can be requested without further spatial specifications. This puts down a first building block in the construction of a controllable data-driven VR sword fighter capable of multiple behaviours.
LBW2118: JeL: Connecting Through Breath in Virtual Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,John Desnoyers-Stewart  Simon Fraser University Ekaterina R. Stepanova  Simon Fraser University Philippe Pasquier  Simon Fraser University Bernhard E. Riecke  Simon Fraser University,We present JeL—a bio-responsive immersive installation for interpersonal synchronization through breathing. In JeL  two users are immersed in a virtual underwater environment  where their individual breathing controls the movement of a jellyfish. As users synchronize their breathing  a virtual glass sponge-like structure starts to grow  representing the users' physiological synchrony. JeL explores a novel form of interpersonal interaction in virtual reality that aims to connect users to their physiological state through biofeedback  to each other through physiological synchronization  and to nature through connecting with a jellyfish and collaboratively growing a glass sponge-inspired sculpture. This form of immersive  bio-responsive interaction could ultimately be used to encourage self-awareness  a feeling of connectedness  and consequently pro-social and pro-environmental attitudes. Here  we describe the motivation  inspiration  design elements  and future work involved in bringing this system to fruition.
LBW2119: Towards a Framework for Validating the Matching Between Notifications and Scents in Olfactory In-Car Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Dmitrijs Dmitrenko  University of Sussex Emanuela Maggioni  University of Sussex Marianna Obrist  University of Sussex,Olfactory notifications have been proven to have a positive impact on drivers. This has motivated the use of scents to convey driving-relevant information. Research has proposed the use of such scents as lemon  peppermint  lavender and rose for in-car notifications. However  there is no framework to identify which scent is the most suitable for every application scenario. In this paper  we propose an approach for validating a matching between scents and driving-relevant notifications. We suggest a study in which the olfactory modality is compared with a puff of clean air  visual  auditory  and tactile stimuli while performing the same driving task. For the data analysis  we suggest recording the lane deviation  speed  time required to recover from the error  as well as the perceived liking and comfort ratings. Our approach aims to help automotive UI designers make better decisions about choosing the most suitable scent  as well as possible alternative modalities.
LBW2120: Augmented Visuotactile Feedback Support Sensorimotor Synchronization Skill for Rehabilitation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Feng Feng  Queen Mary University of London Tony Stockman  Queen Mary University of London,Augmented visual-audio feedback supports rhythmic motor performance in both sports training and sensorimotor synchronization practise. In home-based rehabilitation for minor stroke patients  training on a fine motor skill using rhythms not only helps to recover sophisticated motion ability but also increases their confidence and mental health recovery. Auditory information has been shown to have advantages for improving rhythmic motion performance  but it can be masked by environmental noise and may be intrusive to non-stakeholders. Under these circumstances  patients may be reluctant to practice actively due to difficulties hearing the auditory stimuli or through a concern for disturbing others. To address this issue  we explored an inconspicuous way of providing vibrotactile feedback through wristband. In order to investigate the general feasibility of a sensorimotor synchronization task  we conducted a preliminary user study with 16 healthy participants  and compared the visual-tactile feedback with visual-audio  visual-audio-tactile and visual-only feedback. Results showed that rhythmic motion accuracy with visual-tactile feedback has the equivalent facilitatory effect with visual-audio feedback. In addition  visual-tactile feedback supports smoother movements than the visual-audio feedback. In the future  after refinement with stroke patients  the system could support customization for different levels of sensorimotor synchronization training.
LBW2121: Modulating Personal Audio to Convey Information,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Jamie Ferguson  University of Glasgow Stephen Brewster  University of Glasgow,A long lasting problem in the design of auditory displays is how to design audio feedback that is aesthetically appealing and comfortable to listen to. Many systems focus solely on function and do not consider these other factors. This can lead to annoyance for users  or more extremely  abandonment of the system entirely. Instead of communicating information through sound which is built in to the system  an alternative method is to modulate acoustic parameters of a user's own music to encode information. This method - music modulation - has successfully been used in systems for conveying navigational data while walking and listening to music. This paper discusses the potential of applying this method to other contexts and types of data. We present a number of acoustic parameters of music that could be used to encode information and discuss a number of factors affecting the design of sonification systems employing them  with the goal of inciting discussion and further research into this potentially effective method of conveying information through sound.
LBW2122: Designing a Mobile Game That Develops Emotional Resiliency in Indian Country,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Morgan Vigil-Hayes  Northern Arizona University Ann Futterman Collier  Northern Arizona University Giovanni Castillo  Northern Arizona University Davona Blackhorse  Northern Arizona University Nikole Awbery  Northern Arizona University John-Paul Abrahim  Northern Arizona University,Communities in Indian Country experience severe behavioral health inequities [11  12]. Based on recent research investigating scalable behavioral health interventions and therapeutic best practices for Native American (NA) communities  we propose ARORA  a social and emotional learning intervention delivered over a networked mobile game that uses geosocial gaming mechanisms enhanced with augmented reality technology. Focusing on the Navajo community  we take a community-based participatory research approach to include NA psychologists  community health workers  and educators as co-designers of the intervention activities and gaming mechanisms. Critical questions involve the operation of the application across low-infrastructure landscapes as well scalability of design practices to be inclusive of the many diverse NA cultural communities in Indian Country.
LBW2210: TurtleTalk: An Educational Programming Game for Children with Voice User Interface,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Hyunhoon Jung  NAVER Clova AI Hee Jae Kim  NAVER Clova AI Seongeun So  NAVER Clova AI Jinjoong Kim  NAVER Corp. Changhoon Oh  Seoul National University,Interest in programming education for children is growing. This research explores the possibilities of utilizing voice user interface (VUI) in children's programming education. We designed an interactive educational programming game called TurtleTalk  which converts the various utterances of children into code using a neural network and displays the results on a screen (Figure 1). Through VUI  children can move the turtle  the voice agent of the game  to the target location and learn the basic programming concepts of "sequencing" and "iteration.'' We conducted a preliminary user study where eight children played the game and took part in a posthoc interview. The results showed that voice interaction with TurtleTalk led children to be more immersed in the game and understand the elements of programming with ease and confidence.
LBW2211: OrigamiSpeaker: Handcrafted Paper Speaker with Silver Nano-Particle Ink,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Kunihiro Kato  The University of Tokyo Kazuya Saito  Kyushu University Yoshihiro Kawahara  The University of Tokyo,In this study  we present an OrigamiSpeaker which can be handcrafted with silver nano-particle ink on a paper substrate. The OrigamiSpeaker is based on the "electrostatic loudspeaker" technique. The audio signal is amplified to a high voltage and applied to an electrode that vibrates to generate sound. By using Origami techniques  users are able to design various shapes of OrigamiSpeaker.
LBW2212: 3DTactileDraw: A Tactile Pattern Design Interface for Complex Arrangements of Actuators,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Oliver Beren Kaul  Leibniz University Hannover (LUH) Leonard Hansing  Leibniz University Hannover (LUH) Michael Rohs  Leibniz University Hannover (LUH),Creating tactile patterns for a grid or a 3D arrangement of a large number of actuators presents a challenge as the design space is huge. This paper explores two different possibilities of implementing an easy-to-use interface for tactile pattern design on a large number of actuators around the head. Two user studies were conducted in order to iteratively improve the prototype to fit user needs.
LBW2213: Audio-visual AR to Improve Awareness of Hazard Zones Around Robots,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Ane San Martín  IK4-TEKNIKER Johan Kildal  IK4-TEKNIKER,Navigating a space populated by fenceless industrial robots while carrying out other tasks can be stressful  as the worker is unsure about when she is invading the area of influence of a robot  which is a hazard zone. Such areas are difficult to estimate and standing in one may have consequences for worker safety and for the productivity of the robot. We investigate the use of multimodal (auditory and/or visual) head-mounted AR displays to warn about entering hazard zones while performing an independent navigation task. As a first step in this research  we report a design-research study (including a user study)  conducted to obtain a visual and an auditory AR display subjectively judged to approach equivalence. The goal is that these designs can serve as the basis for a future modality comparison study.
LBW2214: First Steps Towards Walk-In-Place Locomotion and Haptic Feedback in Virtual Reality for Visually Impaired,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Julian Kreimeier  Nuremberg Institute of Technology Timo Götzelmann  Nuremberg Institute of Technology,This paper presents the first results on a user study in which people with visual impairments (PVI) explored a virtual environment (VE) by walking in a virtual reality (VR) treadmill. As recently suggested  we have now acquired first results from our feasibility study investigating this walk-in-place interaction. This represents a new  more intuitive way of for example virtually exploring unknown spaces in advance. Our prototype consists of off-the-shelf VR components (i.e.  treadmill  headphones  glasses  and controller) providing a simplified white cane simulation and was tested by six visually impaired subjects. Our results indicate that this interaction is yet difficult  but promising and an important step to make VR more and better usable for PVIs. As an impact on the CHI community  we would like to make this research field known to a wider audience by sharing our intermediate results and suggestions for improvements  on some of which we are already working on.
LBW2215: FabAuth: Printed Objects Identification Using Resonant Properties of Their Inner Structures,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Yuki Kubo  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Kana Eguchi  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Ryosuke Aoki  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Shigekuni Kondo  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Shozo Azuma  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Takuya Indo  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,We present a method we propose called FabAuth for identifying 3D-printed objects  which utilizes the differences in the resonant properties of such objects. We focus on changing the internal structures of each object made through a 3D printing process to assign a unique resonant property to it even if multiple objects have the same appearance. To identify the objects  the method identifies resonant property differences by using vibration that can pass through 3D-printed objects. The method can be applied even to low-filled 3D-printed objects as long as an acoustic wave can travel through the objects from one sensor to another. To validate the method's feasibility  we conducted a preliminary experiment to confirm whether it can be applied to low-filled 3D-printed objects and found that its average classification accuracy reached 92.2%.
LBW2216: FingMag: Finger Identification Method for Smartwatch,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Keunwoo Park  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Geehyuk Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,Interacting with a smartwatch is difficult owing to its small touchscreen. A general strategy to overcome the limitations of the small screen is to increase the input vocabulary. A popular approach to do this is to distinguish fingers and assign different functions to them. As a finger identification method for a smartwatch  we propose FingMag  a machine-learning-based method that identifies the finger on the screen with the help of a ring. For this identification  the finger's touch position and the magnetic field from a magnet embedded in the ring are used. In an offline evaluation using data collected from 12 participants  we show that FingMag can identify the finger with an accuracy of 96.21% in stationary geomagnetic conditions.
LBW2217: Improving Two-Thumb Touchpad Typing in Virtual Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Jeongmin Son  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Sunggeun Ahn  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Sunbum Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Geehyuk Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,Two-Thumb Touchpad Typing (4T) using hand-held controllers is one of the common text entry techniques in Virtual Reality (VR). However  its performance is far below that of two-thumb typing on a smartphone. We explored the possibility of improving its performance focusing on the following two factors: the visual feedback of hovering thumbs and the grip stability of the controllers. We examined the effects of these two factors on the performance of 4T in VR in user experiments. Their results show that hover feedback had a significant main effect on the 4T performance  but grip stability did not. We then investigated the achievable performance of the final 4T design in a longitudinal study  and its results show that users could achieve a typing speed over 30 words per minute after two hours of practice.
LBW2218: Chinese Character Learning System,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Yifan Yang  Zhejiang University Leijing Zhou  University of Nottingham Ningbo China Rujian Li  Zhejiang University Hang Yao  Zhejiang University Jialu Song  Zhejiang University Fangtian Ying  Wuhan University of Technology,As the distinctions of formation structure between Chinese and Western languages  learners take more effort in grasping correct formation structure and pronunciation when they are studying Chinese character. Various Chinese character learning systems have already been proposed in order to help the learners recognize the character  but ignore its handwriting and cultural background. We here present a learning system for learners to study Chinese character better. To increase the effectiveness in learning Chinese character  we combine pronunciation and character writing with the integrated use of computer  projector and camera in this design. This system eases the learners to understand the meaning  cultural background and formation structure of character by using the morphological and phonetic animation projection and handwriting instruction. In comparison with screen-writing systems  this system provides a more authentic learning experience for learners through simulating the learning process of writing on real paper. We anticipate our system to be a starting point to explore the instruction in Chinese character in the field of its formation structure  pronunciation and handwriting  and to be used in the classroom or at home in the future.
LBW2219: "It sounds like she is sad": Introducing a Biosensing Prototype that Transforms Emotions into Real-time Music and Facilitates Social Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Xi Lu  Indiana University Bloomington Xiaohang Liu  Indiana University Bloomington Erik Stolterman Bergqvist  Indiana University Bloomington,This paper introduces a biosensing prototype that transforms emotions into music  helping people recognize and understand their own feelings and actions and those of other people. This study presents a series of three experiments with 20 participants in four emotional states: happiness  sadness  anger  and neutral state. Their real-time emotions were captured through a wearable probe Audiolize Emotion that detects users' EEG signals  composes data into audio files which are played to users themselves and others. At last  we conducted observations and interviews with participants to explore factors linked with social interaction  users' perceptions of music  and the reflections on the use of audio form for self-expression or communication. We found that Audiolize Emotion prototype triggers communication and self-expression in two ways: building curiosity and supporting communication by extending expression form. Based on the results  we provide future directions to explore the field of emotion and communication further and plan to apply the knowledge into more fields of VR game and accessibility.
LBW2220: Vibrotactile Wristband for Warning and Guiding in Automated Vehicles,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Zhuoluo Ma  Beijing Institute of Technology Yue Liu  Beijing Institute of Technology & Beijing Film Academy Dejiang Ye  Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing Lu Zhao  Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing,In this paper  we introduce a vibrotactile wristband for warning and guiding the driver based on the road condition in automated vehicles. The vibrotactile wristband can receive the command from the host computer in the vehicles via Bluetooth and generate the corresponding vibration patterns with six vibration motors. 3 vibration patterns are designed to guide the driver to the right direction in the artificial driving state and 8 vibration patterns are designed to warn the driver about the problems which the driving support system can't solve in the automatic driving state. Based on tactile illusions  we convert the graphical markers into the vibration patterns to reduce the driver's memory burden and improve the accuracy of recognizing the patterns. In order to evaluate the performance of the vibrotactile wristband  a virtual driving environment is developed and the subject can experience the vibration patterns when he/she drives the virtual vehicle.
LBW2221: Usability of Code Voting Modalities,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Karola Marky  Technische Universität Darmstadt Martin Schmitz  Technische Universität Darmstadt Felix Lange  Technische Universität Darmstadt Max Mühlhäuser  Technische Universität Darmstadt,Internet voting has promising benefits  such as cost reduction  but it also introduces drawbacks: the computer  that is used for voting  learns the voter's choice. Code voting aims to protect the voter's choice by the introduction of voting codes that are listed on paper. To cast a vote  the voters need to provide the voting code belonging to their choice. The additional step influences the usability. We investigate three modalities for entering voting codes: manual  QR-codes and tangibles. The results show that QR-codes offer the best usability while tangibles are perceived as the most novel and fun.
LBW2222: Towards Augmenting IVR Communication with Physiological Sensing Data,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Ceenu George  LMU Munich Mariam Hassib  Bundeswehr University of Munich & LMU Munich,Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) does not afford social cues for communication  such as sweaty palms to indicate stress  as users can only see an avatar of their collaborator. Prior work has shown that this data is necessary for successful collaboration  which is why we propose to augment IVR communication by (1) real-time capturing of physiological senses and (2) leveraging the unlimited virtual space to display these. We present the results of a focus group (N=7) and a preliminary study (N=32) that investigate how this data may be visualized in a playful interaction and the effects they have on the performances of the collaborators.
LBW2310: Byte.it: Discreet Teeth Gestures for Mobile Device Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Tomás Vega Gálvez  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Shardul Sapkota  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Alexandru Dancu  Singapore University of Design Pattie Maes  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Byte.it is an exploration of the feasibility of using miniaturized  discreet hardware for teeth-clicking as hands-free input for wearable computing. Prior work has been able to identify teeth-clicking of different teeth groups. Byte.it expands on this work by exploring the use of a smaller and more discreetly positioned sensor suite (accelerometer and gyroscope) for detecting four different teeth-clicks for everyday human-computer interaction. Initial results show that an unobtrusive position on the lower mastoid and mandibular condyle can be used to classify teeth-clicking of four different teeth groups with an accuracy of 89%.
LBW2311: Alexa  Can You Help Us Solve This Problem? How Conversations With Smart Personal Assistant Tutors Increase Task Group Outcomes,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Rainer Winkler  University of St. Gallen Matthias Söllner  University of St. Gallen & University of Kassel Maya Lisa Neuweiler  University of St. Gallen Flavia Conti Rossini  University of St. Gallen Jan Marco Leimeister  University of St. Gallen,Despite a growing body of research about the design and use of Smart Personal Assistants  existing work has mainly focused on their use as task support for individual users in rather simple problem scenarios. Less is known about their ability to improve collaboration among multiple users in more complex problem settings. In our study  we directly compare 21 groups who either use a Smart Personal Assistant tutor or a human tutor when solving a problem task. The results indicate that groups interacting with Smart Personal Assistant tutors show significantly higher task outcomes and higher degrees of collaboration quality compared to groups interacting with human tutors. The results are used to suggest areas for future research in the field of computer-supported collaboration.
LBW2312: "Watch Out!": Semi-Autonomous Vehicles Using Assertive Voices to Grab Distracted Drivers' Attention,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Priscilla N. Y. Wong  UCL Interaction Centre Duncan P. Brumby  University College London Harsha Vardhan Ramesh Babu  ustwo Kota Kobayashi  ustwo,Semi-autonomous vehicles are gradually appearing on our roads  and have already been involved in several high-profile accidents. These accidents usually occurred because the driver did not intervene in time when the automated system failed. An important issue for the design of future semi-autonomous vehicles is identifying effective methods for alerting drivers to critical events that require their intervention. To investigate this  we report the results of a lab-based simulator study in which participants had to respond to driving events while also playing an immersive mobile game on a phone. Results show that a more assertive voice alerting the driver to driving events resulted in faster reaction times and was perceived as more urgent than a less assertive voice  regardless of how immersed the driver was in the mobile game. These results suggest that the designers of future semi-autonomous vehicles should use assertive voice commends to alert drivers to critical events that require their intervention.
LBW2313: Bubble: Wearable Assistive Grasping Augmentation Based on Soft Inflatables,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Xinlei Zhang  The University of Tokyo & Massachusetts Institute of Technology Ali Shtarbanov  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Jiani Zeng  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Valerie K. Chen  Massachusetts Institute of Technology V. Michael Bove  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Pattie Maes  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Jun Rekimoto  The University of Tokyo,We present Bubble  a pneumatically actuated wearable device that enables people with hand disabilities to use their own hands to grasp objects without fully bending their fingers. Bubble offers a novel approach to grasping  where slim  ultra-lightweight silicone actuators are attached to the fingers. When the user wishes to grasp an object  the silicone units inflate pneumatically to fill the available space around the object. The inflatable units are interchangeable  can be independently inflated  and can be positioned anywhere on the fingers in any orientation  thereby enabling a wide variety of grasping gestures including the palmar grasp  pinch  etc. In this paper  we describe the implementation of our current prototype  the fabrication process of the soft inflatable units  as well as our preliminary study to evaluate our system's grasping capability.
LBW2314: Design and Evaluation of a Texture Rendering Method for Electrostatic Tactile Display,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Lu Zhao  Beijing Institute of Technology Yue Liu  Beijing Institute of Technology & Beijing Film Academy Zhuoluo Ma  Beijing Institute of Technology Yongtian Wang  Beijing Institute of Technology & Beijing Film Academy,Experiencing a sense of touching the displayed objects is the common goal of researchers and users. In this paper  a new texture rendering method for electrostatic tactile display is proposed  through which lateral force to the moving finger is calculated and generated by electrostatic attraction force based on the recorded data such as acceleration signals and friction properties of actual materials. The electrostatic attraction force is adjusted according to the exploring speeds of user's finger. User studies of adjective and similarity ratings on roughness and stickiness of virtual materials are designed  and the results demonstrate that the sense of touching the rendered materials is similar to that of the real materials  which proves that the proposed texture rendering method can be applied to display tactile information in an electrostatic tactile display.
LBW2315: Cognitive Aid: Task Assistance Based On Mental Workload Estimation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Qiushi Zhou  University of Melbourne Joshua Newn  University of Melbourne Namrata Srivastava  University of Melbourne Tilman Dingler  University of Melbourne Jorge Goncalves  University of Melbourne Eduardo Velloso  University of Melbourne,In this work  we evaluate the potential of using wearable non-contact (infrared) thermal sensors through a user study (N=12) to measure mental workload. Our results indicate the possibility of mental workload estimation through the temperature changes detected using the prototype as participants perform two task variants with increasing difficulty levels. While the sensor accuracy and the design of the prototype can be further improved  the prototype showed the potential of building AR-based systems with cognitive aid technology for ubiquitous task assistance from the changes in mental workload demands. As such  we demonstrate our next steps by integrating our prototype into an existing AR headset (i.e. Microsoft HoloLens).
LBW2316: An Exploratory Study for Evaluating the Use of Floor Visualisations in Navigation Decisions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Luluah Albarrak  University of Bristol Oussama Metatla  University of Bristol Anne Roudaut  University of Bristol,Different environmental cues can influence our spatial behaviour when we explore unfamiliar spaces. Research shows that the presence of other people affects our navigation decisions. To investigate the use of this environmental cue as a navigation aid in novel environment  we first explore visualisations that represent historical presence of people. We carried out an exploratory study (n=12) to examine whether and how people understand and use floor visualisations to make their navigational choices. Results suggest that floor visualisations have influenced participants' navigation decisions. Our findings showed that implicit visualisations were difficult to interpret compared to explicit visualisations. Thematic analysis of participants' interpretations revealed a contextual interpretation of explicit visualisations and non-contextual interpretation of implicit visualisations. Additionally  thematic analysis revealed that spatial behaviour is influenced by several factors including self-centredness  environmental features and the presence of others. These design insights will inform the design of history-enriched floor interfaces that direct people in the built environment.
LBW2317: The Challenges of Creating Engaging Content: Results from a Focus Group Study of a Popular News Media Organization,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Kholoud Khalil Aldous  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Jisun An  Qatar Computing Research Institute & Hamad Bin Khalifa University Bernard J. Jansen  Qatar Computing Research Institute & Hamad Bin Khalifa University,The process of content creation for distribution via social media platforms is not a trivial one for social media editors as the goal of creating both serious and engaging content is challenging  with no clear or differing guidelines or rules across and between platforms. For creators of serious content  such as news organizations  advertisers  or educational institutions  engagement has a deeper meaning beyond likes  shares  etc. that is aimed at the audience actually processing the underlying content associated with a social media post. In this research  we report findings from a group study that aimed to understand the process and challenges of creating engaging content across three social media platforms in a major news organization. The findings from the study indicate that creating engaging content is effort- and time-consuming  and they highlight the need to support the process of creating engaging content across multiple social media platforms. Our longer-term goal is to develop a system design to support social media editors' creation of engaging content with which they can select engaging passages from news articles and select platforms on which to publish the content.
LBW2319: Navigating Uncertainty in the Future of Work: Information-Seeking and Critical Events Among Online Freelancers,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Allie Blaising  California Polytechnic University Yasmine Kotturi  Carnegie Mellon University Chinmay Kulkarni  Carnegie Mellon University,Online freelancer marketplaces offer workers the flexibility and control they desire. However  workers also struggle with the uncertainty resulting from these benefits. In traditional brick-and-mortar workplaces  workers who experience uncertainty during specific phases of their assimilation into a new role or organization engage in information-seeking behaviors. Understanding these phases of heightened uncertainty helps organizations better cater to workers' informational needs e.g. through mentorship programs. While understanding the uncertainty that online workers experience as they assimilate into their career is critical to understanding online workers' needs  such an understanding is currently severely limited. thus  we conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 online freelancers to investigate critical events that contribute to uncertainty early in their online careers. We situate these critical events within the context of organizational assimilation  and how participants employ diverse information-seeking tactics.
LBW2320: Human-Data Interaction in the Context of Care: Co-designing Family Civic Data Interfaces and Practices,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Alex Bowyer  Newcastle University Rob Wilson  Northumbria University Stuart Wheater  Arjuna Technologies Matthew Snape  Newcastle University Kyle Montague  Newcastle University,By storing data about citizens for the purposes of service provision  private and public organizations have disempowered the people they serve  shifting the balance of power toward themselves as data holders. Through three co-production engagements involving families receiving "early help" support from their local authority and support workers involved in supplying this care  we have identified existing data usage practices  explored the impact of those practices upon the supported families  and co-designed new and improved approaches – both technological and practice-based – that are perceived to offer families fairer treatment  greater influence  and to benefit from better decision-making. Our findings show that by applying Human-Data Interaction and giving supported families direct access to see and manipulate their own data  both during and outside of the support engagement  the locus of decision-making could be shifted towards the data subject.
LBW2321: Affective Assistants: A Matter of States and Traits,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Michael Braun  BMW Group Research & LMU Munich Florian Alt  Bundeswehr University Munich,This work presents a model for the development of affective assistants based on the pillars of user states and traits. Traits are defined as long-term qualities like personality  personal experiences  preferences  and demographics  while the user state comprises cognitive load  emotional states  and physiological parameters. We discuss useful input values and the necessary developments for an advancement of affective assistants with the example of an affective in-car voice assistant. With our work we help to shape the vision of our community regarding affective interfaces  not just in the automotive domain but also for other application areas.
LBW2322: Implicit User Calibration for Model-based Gaze-tracking System using Face Detection around Optical Axis of Eye,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Mamoru Hiroe  Kobe University Shogo Mitsunaga  Kobe University Takashi Nagamatsu  Kobe University,In recent studies of gaze tracking system using 3D model-based methods  the optical axis of the eye is estimated without user calibration. The remaining problem for achieving implicit user calibration is to estimate the difference between the optical axis and visual axis of the eye (angle kappa). In this paper  we propose an implicit user calibration method using face detection around the optical axis of the eye. We assume that the peak of the average of face region images indicates the visual axis of the eye in the eye coordinate system. The angle kappa is estimated as the difference between the optical axis of the eye and the peak of the average of face region images. We developed a prototype system with two cameras and two IR-LEDs. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can estimate the angle kappa more accurately than the method that uses Itti's saliency map instead of face detection.
LBW2410: "I Have a Life": Teacher Communication & Management Outside the Classroom,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Serena Hillman  SMART Technologies Alexandra Hillman  SMART Technologies Carman Neustaedter  Simon Fraser University Carolyn Pang  McGill University,Over the past decade  there has been an increase in educational software use within classrooms as well as continuing demand on K-12 teachers extending beyond in-class activities. Yet  we still do not have a deep understanding of current teacher behaviors outside the classroom. Our paper presents insights on how to better design for technology use in this space by reporting on key themes such as communication  privacy and student technology at home. These findings translate into design implications to increase transparency with student data  the need to design first for technology students have access to in the home (e.g. mobile) and designing for the teacher need of setting personal boundaries within communication tools.
LBW2411: Modeling Error Rates in Spatiotemporal Moving Target Selection,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Jin Huang  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences Byungjoo Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,When we try to acquire a moving target such as hitting a virtual tennis in a computer game  we must hit the target instantly when it flies over our hitting range. In other words  we have to acquire the target in spatial and temporal domains simultaneously. We call this type of task spatiotemporal moving target selection  which we find is common yet less studied in HCI. This paper presents a tentative model for predicting the error rates in spatiotemporal moving target selection. Our model integrates two latest models  the Ternary-Gaussian model and the Temporal Pointing model  to explain the influence of spatial and temporal constraints on pointing errors. In a 12-subject pointing experiment with a computer mouse  our model shows high fitting results with 0.904 R2. We discuss future research directions on this topic and how it could potentially help the design in dynamical user interfaces.
LBW2412: Trajectory Prediction Model for Crossing-Based Target Selection,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Hao Zhang  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences Jin Huang  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences Feng Tian  Institute of software  Chinese Academy of Sciences,In some cases  crossing-based target selection motion may gain a less error rates and a higher interactive speed. Most of the research in target selection fields focused on the analysis of interaction results. Moreover  trajectories play a much more important role in crossing-based target selection comparing to the other interactive techniques. And an ideal model for trajectories may help computer designers make predictions about interaction results during the process of target selection rather than at the end of the whole process. We proposed a trajectory prediction model for crossing-based target selection tasks referring to dynamic model theory. Simulation results show that our model performed well in the prediction of the trajectories  endpoints and the hitting time for target-selection motion  and the average error of trajectories  endpoints and hitting time values as 17.28%  18.17 pixel and 11.50%.
LBW2413: It Sounds Like A Woman: Exploring Gender Stereotypes in South Korean Voice Assistants,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Gilhwan Hwang  Seoul National University Jeewon Lee  Seoul National University Cindy Yoonjung Oh  Seoul National University Joonhwan Lee  Seoul National University,For the past few years  voice assistant (VA) has been widely used around the world. Current voice assistants provide a gendered voice to sound more natural and life-like  but most of them have a female voice as a default voice setting. Our study explored how gender stereotypes of women are reflected in voice assistants with female voices through analyzing five South Korean VAs. We collected 1 602 responses from VAs and conducted a thematic analysis to examine the patterns of the gender stereotype. As a result  we have categorized three distinct characteristics: (1) bodily display  (2) subordinate attitude  (3) sexualization. We suggested that these stereotypical traits could create a power dynamic between users and female agents.
LBW2414: Is Seeing Believing? The Effect of Morphological Congruent Visual Feedback on Mediated Touch Experience,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Sima Ipakchian Askari  Eindhoven University of Technology Antal Haans  Eindhoven University of Technology Wijnand A. IJsselsteijn  Eindhoven University of Technology,Mediated social touch (MST) provides physical contact over a distance for geographically separated individuals. Despite advances in actuator technologies  it remains difficult to recreate the feel and sensation of natural human touch. Combining touch with morphologically congruent visual feedback may overcome limitations related to the low fidelity of current-day tactile displays. Being able to both feel and see the touch act being initiated on an input device could enhance the perceived realism of the touches. In two studies  we test the effects of such visual feedback on self-reported naturalness of touch  social presence  and emotional experiences.
LBW2415: Personal Safety App Effectiveness,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Mike Just  Heriot-Watt University Hasmeet Chandok  Dalhousie University Raghav Sampangi  Dalhousie University Kirstie Hawkey  Dalhousie University Alette Willis  University of Edinburgh JeyaBalaji Samuthiravelu  Dalhousie University Dilpreet Gill  Dalhousie University Michael Altair  Dalhousie University,We present the results of our study of people's responses to unsafe scenarios with personal safety apps. Several such apps have been developed  offering features such as a location-sharing panic button. However  there is little research into how people might respond in different personal safety situations  and how such apps might contribute to their response. We performed a lab study with 30 participants and used semi-structured interviews to gather responses to a set of three increasingly risky scenarios  both before and after the installation of a personal safety app. From our results  participants stated that they would use mobile phones and personal safety apps most often to support "collective" responses  with calls to others for assistance. Further  while collective responses were often combined with "avoidance" or "protective" responses  when using a personal safety app  collective responses were less often combined with other reaction types. Overall  our results suggest some potential benefit from personal safety apps  though more study is required.
LBW2416: Perception of Emotion in Body Expressions from Gaze Behavior,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Andrea Kleinsmith  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Azin Semsar  University of Maryland  Baltimore County,Developing affectively aware technologies is a growing industry. To build them effectively  it is important to understand the features involved in discriminating between emotions. While many technologies focus on facial expressions  studies have highlighted the influence of body expressions over other modalities for perceiving some emotions. Eye tracking studies have evaluated the combination of face and body to investigate the influence of each modality  however  few to none have investigated the perception of emotion from body expressions alone. This exploratory study aimed to evaluate the discriminative importance of dynamic body features for decoding emotion. Eye tracking was used to monitor participants' eye gaze behavior while viewing clips of non-acted body movements to which they associated an emotion. Preliminary results indicate that the two primary regions attended to most often and longest were the torso and the arms. Further analysis is ongoing  however initial results independently confirm prior studies without eye tracking.
LBW2417: Public Speaking Anxiety in a Real Classroom: Towards Developing a Reflection System,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Heera Lee  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Andrea Kleinsmith  University of Maryland  Baltimore County,Public speaking is recognized as an important skill for success in learning and education. However  the mere thought of public speaking elicits anxiety in many people. This anxiety may manifest in a student's nonverbal behaviors and physiological responses which can negatively affect both performance and evaluation. While public speaking training systems have employed a variety of speaker cues to automatically evaluate and score public speaking performance  many are built on data collected in a lab setting. However  it is difficult to achieve the same level of anxiety in these environments. We posit that students would benefit from a system that provides the ability to reflect on and practice public speaking presentation skills. This preliminary study explores public speaking anxiety from physiological responses and nonverbal behaviors of English language learners in-situ as a first step toward the design and development of a public speaking practice and reflection system.
LBW2418: (Over)Trust in Automated Driving: The Sleeping Pill of Tomorrow?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Thomas Kundinger  AUDI AG & Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt Philipp Wintersberger  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University Andreas Riener  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University,Both overtrust in technology and drowsy driving are safety-critical issues. Monitoring a system is a tedious task and overtrust in technology might also influence drivers' vigilance  what in turn could multiply the negative impact of both issues. The aim of this study was to investigate if trust in automation affects drowsiness. 30 participants in two age groups conducted a 45-minute ride in a level-2 vehicle on a real test track. Trust was assessed before and after the ride with a subjective trust scale. Drowsiness was captured during the experiment using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Results depict  that even a short initial system exposure significantly increases trust in automated driving. Drivers who trust the automated vehicles more show larger signs of drowsiness what may negatively impact the monitoring behavior. Drowsiness detection is important for automated vehicles  and the behavior of drowsy drivers might help to infer trust in an unobtrusively way.
LBW2419: Infrastructure vs. Community: Co-spaces Confront Digital Nomads' Paradoxical Needs,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Ahreum Lee  Purdue University Austin L. Toombs  Purdue University Ingrid Erickson  Syracuse University,Co-working and co-living companies are rising globally and the increasing participation within the gig economy has extended the range of users of community-based spaces (co-spaces) and raised a set of different community models in considering how to support them. In this paper  we specifically focus on the needs of digital nomads in co-spaces who struggle to pursue their personal and professional freedom. In so doing  we raise awareness of existing tensions that currently hinder the social engagement of these individuals in co-space settings.
LBW2420: Cognitive Learning: How to Become William Shakespeare,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Xiaotong Liu  IBM Research - Almaden Anbang Xu  IBM Research - Almaden Zhe Liu  IBM Almaden Research Center Yufan Guo  IBM Research - Almaden Rama Akkiraju  IBM Research - Almaden,Writing is a fundamental task in our daily life. Existing writing improvement tools mostly focus on low-level grammar error correction  rather than enhancing users' writing styles at the cognitive level. In this work  we present a computational approach that allows learners to have fast but effective learning experience with the help of automatic style transfer  visual stylometry analytics  machine teaching and practice. Our system provides a perfect fusion of vividly visualized style features and principles along with informative examples  which together can shape and drive personalized cognitive learning experience. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in a scenario of learning from William Shakespeare.
LBW2421: The Helpless Soft Robot - Stimulating Human Collaboration through Robotic Movement,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Anna Dagmar Bille Milthers  Aalborg University Anne Bjerre Hammer  Aalborg University Jonathan Jung Johansen  Aalborg University Lasse Goul Jensen  Aalborg University Elizabeth Ann Jochum  Aalborg University Markus Löchtefeld  Aalborg University,Soft robotics have a set of unique traits  such as excelling at grabbing fragile objects which stem from the highly compliant materials used to produce them. However  very little research has so far focused on the interplay of the different interaction partners in a human - soft-robot collaboration. In this paper  we present the results of our investigation of the influence of two movement patterns on the willingness of random passersby to assist a soft robot in completing a task.
LBW2422: Should an Agent Be Ignoring It? A Study of Verbal Abuse Types and Conversational Agents' Response Styles,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Hyojin Chin  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology Mun Yong Yi  Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology,Verbal abuse is a hostile form of communication ill-intended to harm the other person. With a plethora of AI solutions around  the other person being targeted may be a conversational agent. In this study  involving 3 verbal abuse types (Insult  Threat  Swearing) and 3 response styles (Avoidance  Empathy  Counterattacking)  we examine whether a conversational agent's response style under varying abuse types influences those emotions found to mitigate people's aggressive behaviors. Sixty-four participants  assigned to one of the abuse type conditions  interacted with the three conversational agents in turn and reported their feelings about guiltiness  anger  and shame after each session. Our study results show that  regardless of the abuse type  the agent's response style has a significant effect on user emotions. Participants were less angry and more guilty with the empathetic agent than the other two agents. Our study findings have direct implications for the design of conversational agents.
LBW2510: A Gaze-Based Exploratory Study on the Information Seeking Behavior of Developers on Stack Overflow,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Cole S. Peterson  University of Nebraska - Lincoln Jonathan A. Saddler  University of Nebraska - Lincoln Natalie M. Halavick  Purdue University Bonita Sharif  University of Nebraska - Lincoln,Software developers use Stack Overflow on a daily basis to search for solutions to problems they encounter during bug fixing and feature enhancement. In prior work  studies have been done on mining Stack Overflow data such as for predicting unanswered questions or how and why people post. However  no work exists on how developers actually use  or more importantly  read the information presented to them on Stack Overflow. To better understand this behavior  we conduct an eye tracking study on how developers seek for information on Stack Overflow while tasked with creating human-readable summaries of methods and classes in large Java projects. Eye gaze data is collected on both the source code elements and Stack Overflow document elements at a fine token-level granularity using iTrace  our eye tracking infrastructure. We found that developers look at the text more often than the title in posts. Code snippets were the second most looked at element. Tags and votes are rarely looked at. When switching between Stack Overflow and the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE)  developers often looked at method signatures and then switched to code and text elements on Stack Overflow. Such heuristics provide insight to automated code summarization tools as they decide what to give more weight to while generating summaries.
LBW2511: Supporting Data Workers To Perform Exploratory Programming,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Krishna Subramanian  RWTH Aachen University Ilya Zubarev  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,Data science is an open-ended task in whichexploratory programming is a common practice. Data workers often need faster and easier ways to explore alternative approaches to obtain insights from data  which frequently compromises code quality. To understand how well current IDEs support this exploratory workflow  we conducted an observational study with 19 data workers. In this paper  we present two significant findings from our analysis that highlight issues faced by data workers: (a)code hoarding and (b) excessivetask switching andcode cloning. To mitigate these issues  we provide design recommendations based on existing work  and propose to augment IDEs with an interactive visual plugin. This plugin parses source code to identify and visualize high-level task details. Data workers can use the resulting visualization to better understand and navigate the source code. As a realization of this idea  we presentAddIn  an add-in for RStudio that identifies and visualizes the hypotheses that a data worker is testing for statistical significance through her source code.
LBW2512: Where in the Cloud is my Data? Location and Brand Effects on Trust in Cloud Services,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,S. Shyam Sundar  Penn State University Jinyoung Kim  Penn State University Eugene Cho  Penn State University,We all hold stereotypes about different locations across the world. Do these stereotypes affect our attitudes toward cloud services when we are told the location of the servers storing our data? And  does it matter if the cloud services are provided by a well-known brand? To answer these questions  a 2 X 11 experiment was conducted to examine the effects of location and brand cues on users' reaction to cloud services. Brand authority of the hosting company had a positive effect. More importantly  location of the cloud servers also affected outcomes  in that users tended to prefer some locations (e.g.  US  Europe  Oceania  China) over others (e.g.  Russia) for storing their cloud data. These findings have theoretical implications as well as design suggestions.
LBW2513: Acceptance of Self-Driving Cars: Does Their Posthuman Ability Make Them More Eerie or More Desirable?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Andrew Gambino  Penn State University S. Shyam Sundar  Penn State University,The arrival of self-driving cars and smart technologies is fraught with controversy  as users hesitate to cede control to machines for vital tasks. While advances in engineering have made such autonomous technology a reality  considerable design work is needed to motivate their mass adoption. What are the key predictors of people's acceptance of self-driving cars? Is it the ease of use or coolness aspect? Is it the degree of perceived control for users? We decided to find out with a survey (N = 404) assessing acceptance of self-driving cars  and discovered that the strongest predictor is "posthuman ability " suggesting that individuals are much more accepting of technology that can clearly outclass human abilities.
LBW2514: Configuring Personal Data for a Quantified-Self Archive,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Ciaran B. Trace  University of Texas at Austin Yan Zhang  University of Texas at Austin,An audience exists for personal information  including quantified-self data  beyond an individual's social network and social communities. In the era of big data  the research and policy arenas are two areas where up-to-date assemblages of personal information have market value. In this ongoing study  we examine the long-term value of small data [2]  acknowledging that there is also a societal need and an audience for rich  personalized collections of digital self-tracking records. Using qualitative research methods  we interviewed 18 people to explore the nature of self-tracking data that exists as a byproduct of daily life  and their sense of why and how their data could be archived for posterity. In the process  the intellectual and design challenges of a digital quantified-self archive are explored.
LBW2515: Towards a Typology of Self-Tracking Gaps,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Ciaran B. Trace  University of Texas at Austin Yan Zhang  University of Texas at Austin,This paper introduces an emerging typology of the 'absences' that confound the study of self-tracking. A review of the literature  and the ongoing work of the authors on the long-term value of self-tracking data  is used as a resource to develop descriptions of levels and types of 'gaps' that emerge as part of the activities  behaviors  technologies  and data practices of self-tracking. Such gaps are shown to be both common and insightful  highlighting the economic  social  behavioral  and psychological layers that undergird self-tracking.
LBW2516: Information-theoretic Sensorimotor Foundations of Fitts' Law,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Dari Trendafilov  Johannes Kepler University Daniel Polani  University of Hertfordshire,We propose a novel  biologically plausible cost/fitness function for sensorimotor control  formalized with the information-theoretic principle of empowerment  a task-independent universal utility. Empowerment captures uncertainty in the perception-action loop of different nature (e.g. noise  delays  etc.) in a single quantity. We present the formalism in a Fitts' law type goal-directed arm movement task and suggest that empowerment is one potential underlying determinant of movement trajectory planning in the presence of signal-dependent sensorimotor noise. Simulation results demonstrate the temporal relation of empowerment and various plausible control strategies for this specific task.
LBW2517: Discovering Users for Technical Innovations through Systematic Matchmaking,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Bart van Dijk  Eindhoven University of Technology John Zimmerman  Carnegie Mellon University,Every year Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers create new technical innovations. Unfortunately  the User-Centered Design (UCD) processes used by most designers in HCI does not help much when the challenge is to find the best users for these innovations. We augmented the matchmaking design method  making it more systematic in considering potential users by using a list of 399 occupation groups and by incorporating the customer discovery interviews from the Lean Startup. We then assessed our new design method by searching for users who might benefit from two different technical innovations: ViBand and PaperID. We found that matchmaking with the list of occupation groups helped surface users we would likely have not considered. In addition  the customer discovery interviews helped to generate better applications and additional target users for the innovations. This paper documents our process  the design method  and insights we gained from using it.
LBW2518: Using Reinforced Implementation Intentions to Support Habit Formation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Adhi Wicaksono  University of Birmingham Robert J. Hendley  University of Birmingham Russell Beale  University of Birmingham,Despite promising results  the psychological approach of implementation intentions remain underused in 'in-the-wild' habit formation apps. The majority of existing apps focus on using self-tracking and reminders but these hinder the development of habit. This study proposes a new mechanism to support habit formation by using reinforced implementation intentions. Our findings suggest that adding reinforcement is indeed useful to maintain the level of compliance but it is not necessarily the same in terms of automaticity. We also discuss how the potential use of reinforcement can be improved in the future.
LBW2519: Modeling Drone Pointing Movement with Fitts' Law,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Kaito Yamada  Meiji University Hiroki Usuba  Meiji University Homei Miyahita  Meiji University,Although numerous studies have focused on interfaces for maneuvering drones  a method for evaluating these interfaces has not been established. A pointing experiment was carried out with a drone in this study. The results indicate that the target distance and target width affect the movement time and error rate while maneuvering. This is consistent with the results of previous pointing studies. Fitts' law was not a good fit (R^2 = 0.672)  while the data fit well to a two-part model (R^2 = 0.993). Based on these results  we propose future experimental work that could contribute to improving drone interfaces.
LBW2520: Using Screenshots to Predict Task Switching on Smartphones,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Xiao Yang  Pennsylvania State University Nilam Ram  Pennsylvania State University Thomas Robinson  Stanford University Byron Reeves  Stanford University,Mobile phone use is pervasive  yet little is known about task switching on digital platforms and applications. We propose an unobtrusive experience sampling method to observe how individuals use their smartphones by taking screenshots every 5 seconds when the device is on. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate the psychological process into feature extraction  and use these features to effectively predict the task switching behavior on smartphones. Features are extracted from the sequence of screenshots  gauging visual stimulation  cognitive load  velocity and accumulation  sentiment  and time-related factors. Labels of task switching behavior were manually tagged for 87 182 screenshots from 60 subjects. Using random forest  we demonstrate that we can correctly infer a user's task switching behavior from unstructured data in screenshots with up to 77% accuracy  demonstrating it is a viable option to use features of the screenshots to predict task switching behavior.
LBW2521: Understanding Social Costs in Online Question Asking,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Haiwei Ma  University of Minnesota Bowen Yu  University of Minnesota Hao Fei Cheng  GroupLens Research Haiyi Zhu  University of Minnesota,Various social media sites and online communities provide new channels for people in need to ask questions and seek help. However  individuals may still encounter psychological barriers that deter solicitation for assistance  which is more formally described as \textit{''social costs''}. For example  it can be %concerns people have when seeking help can be the concerns of burdening others  the obligation of reciprocation  etc. To understand what could reduce social costs  we conducted a study in the context of Question-Answering (QA) and investigated the following three factors inspired by literature: anonymity (posting a question anonymously)  recommendation (having the system handle the question routing)  and ephemerality (allowing questions to be visible only for a short period). We built a QA platform to support these three features and conducted a randomized within-subject experiment to test their effects on social costs of posting questions. Results suggest the presence of anonymity  recommendation  and ephemerality reduces the social costs which provides design implications for future community building.
LBW2522: fNIRS and Neurocinematics,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Horia A. Maior  University of Nottingham Richard Ramchurn  The University of Nottingham Sarah Martindale  University of Nottingham Ming Cai  The University of Nottingham Max L. Wilson  University of Nottingham Steve Benford  University of Nottingham,In the overlap between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Cinematics  sits an interest in physiological responses to experiences. Focusing particularly on brain data  Neurocinematics has emerged as a research field using Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensors. Where previous work found inter subject correlations (ISC) between brain measurements of people watching movies in constrained conditions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  we seek to examine similar responses in more naturalistic settings using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS has been shown to be highly suitable for HCI studies  being more portable than fMRI and more tolerant of many natural movements than Electroencephalography (EEG). Early results found significant ISC  which gives a lot of hope and potential for using fNIRS in Neurocinematics.
LBW2610: Tell Me What You Know: GDPR Implications on Designing Transparency and Accountability for News Recommender Systems,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Luciana Monteiro Krebs  UFRGS & Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Oscar Luis Alvarado Rodriguez  KU Leuven Pierre Dewitte  KU Leuven Jef Ausloos  University of Amsterdam David Geerts  KU Leuven Laurens Naudts  KU Leuven Katrien Verbert  KU Leuven,The GDPR has a significant impact on the way users interact with technologies  especially the everyday platforms used to personalize news and related forms of information. This paper presents the initial results from a study whose primary objective is to empirically test those platforms' level of compliance with the so-called 'right to explanation'. Four research topics considered as gaps in existing legal and HCI scholarship originated from the project's initial phase  namely (1) GDPR compliance through user-centered design; (2) the inclusion of values in the system; (3) design considerations regarding interaction strategies  algorithmic experience  transparency  and explanations; and (4) technical challenges. The second phase is currently ongoing and allows us to make some observations regarding the registration process and the privacy policies of three categories of news actors: first-party content providers  news aggregators and social media platforms.
LBW2611: "Woe is me": Examining Older Adults' Perceptions of Privacy,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Hirak Ray  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Flynn Wolf  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Ravi Kuber  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Adam J. Aviv  United States Naval Academy,We conducted a study of n = 20 older adults to better understand their mental models for what the term 'privacy' means to them in both digital and non-digital contexts. Participants were asked to diagrammatically represent this information and describe their drawings in a semi-structured interview setting. Preliminary coding analysis revealed participants' frustrations with available methods for addressing privacy violations. While some asserted that there are both good and bad uses of private data  others avoided technology as a whole out of privacy fears or ambivalence towards using web-based banking and social media services. Some participants described fighting back against privacy attacks  while others felt resigned altogether. Our study provides initial steps towards illuminating privacy perceptions of older adults and can have impacts on training and tailor design for this important demographic.
LBW2612: Security Patterns for Webdesign: a Hierarchical Structure Approach,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Alexander G. Mirnig  University of Salzburg Artur Lupp  University of Salzburg Alexander Meschtscherjakov  University of Salzburg Eleni Economidou  University of Salzburg Manfred Tscheligi  University of Salzburg & AIT,In today's age  a wide range of individuals create their own web presence. Thanks to modern tools  creating a website is easier than ever. In order to make sure that this increased accessibility does not come at the cost of decreased security  the respective web design knowledge should become more accessible as well. We created 16 security patterns for web design based on expert knowledge. We present the solution hierarchy of these patterns and how they might be applied by non-expert users.
LBW2613: Towards Better Security Decisions: Applying Prospect Theory to Cybersecurity,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Leilei Qu  Renmin University of China Cheng Wang  Renmin University of China Ruojin Xiao  Renmin University of China Jianwei Hou  Renmin University of China Wenchang Shi  Renmin University of China Bin Liang  Renmin University of China,Normal users are usually not good at making decisions about cybersecurity  being easily attacked by hackers. Quite a few tools have been devised and implemented to help  but they can not balance security and usability well. To solve the problem  this paper explores the application of prospect theory to security recommendations. We conducted online surveys (n=61) and a between-subjects experiment (n=106) in six conditions to investigate the issues. In the experiment  we provided different security recommendations about two-factor-authentication (2FA) to participants in different conditions and recorded their decisions about enabling it. Results show that participants in the condition "Disadvantage" were willing to adopt 2FA the most. The findings indicate that showing disadvantages can be useful to persuade users into better security decisions.
LBW2614: UltraSonic Watch: Seamless Two-Factor Authentication through Ultrasound,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Dimitra Zarafeta  University of Patras Christina Katsini  University of Patras & Human Opsis George E. Raptis  University of Patras & Human Opsis Nikolaos Avouris  University of Patras,Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security as it requires two pieces of evidence to be provided to an authentication mechanism before granting access to a user. However  people do not prefer 2FA; a reason for this is that 2FA requires performing extra actions. In this late-breaking work  we present UltraSonic Watch which provides a seamless 2FA through ultrasound. We report a small-scale within-subjects study (N=30) which investigates the performance of UltraSonic Watch and the participants' experience (in terms of perception  preference  and willingness to adopt). The results are promising as they revealed that ultrasound can be used to provide an efficient 2FA mechanism  transparent to the users  who are positive in adopting such an approach to increase the security of the authentication process.
LBW2615: VRIA - A Framework for Immersive Analytics on the Web,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Peter W. S. Butcher  University of Chester Nigel W. John  University Of Chester Panagiotis D. Ritsos  Bangor University,We report on the design  implementation and evaluation of VRIA  a framework for building immersive analytics (IA) solutions in Web-based Virtual Reality (VR)  built upon WebVR  A-Frame  React and D3. The recent emergence of affordable VR interfaces have reignited the interest of researchers and developers in exploring new  immersive ways to visualize data. In particular  the use of open-standards web-based technologies for implementing VR in a browser facilitates the ubiquitous and platform-independent adoption of IA systems. Moreover  such technologies work in synergy with established visualization libraries  through the HTML document object model (DOM). We discuss high-level features of VRIA and present a preliminary user experience evaluation of one of our use cases.
LBW2616: Online Privacy in Public Places: How do Location  Terms and Conditions and VPN Influence Disclosure?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Maria D. Molina  Pennsylvania State University Andrew Gambino  Pennsylvania State University S. Shyam Sundar  Pennsylvania State University,Do we disclose more information online when we access Wi-Fi from home compared to the University  or an Airbnb rental  or a coffee shop? Does it matter if we are shown terms and conditions (T&C) before getting online? Will signing into a virtual private network (VPN) affect our disclosure? We conducted an experiment (N = 276) to find out. Our results suggest that while VPN promotes disclosure of personal information and unethical behaviors in an Airbnb network  the provision of T&C inhibits this disclosure. Conversely  in a University network  provision of terms and conditions encourages disclosure of unethical behavior  but the presence of VPN cue inhibits it. Further  a user's belief in the publicness heuristic (public networks are risky) dictate how much users reveal in various locations based on their perceptions of relative security of accessing Wi-Fi from those locations.
LBW2617: Exploring Parallel Coordinates Plots in Virtual Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Slawomir Konrad Tadeja  University of Cambridge Timoleon Kipouros  University of Cambridge Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge,Parallel Coordinates Plots (PCP) are a widely used approach to interactively visualize and analyze multidimensional scientific data in a 2D environment. In this paper  we explore the use of Parallel Coordinates in an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) 3D visualization environment as a means to support the decision-making process in engineering design processes. We evaluate the potential of VR PCP using a formative qualitative study with seven participants. In a task involving 54 points with 29 dimensions per point  we found that participants were able to detect patterns in the dataset compared with a previously published study with two expert users using traditional 2D PCP  which acts as the gold standard for the dataset. The dataset describes the Pareto front for a three-objective aerodynamic design optimization study in turbomachinery.
LBW2618: An Observational Investigation of Reverse Engineers' Process and Mental Models,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Daniel Votipka  University of Maryland Seth Rabin  University of Maryland Kristopher Micinski  Haverford College Jeffrey S. Foster  Tufts University Michelle L. Mazurek  University of Maryland,Reverse engineering is a complex task essential to several software security jobs like vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. While traditional program comprehension tasks (e.g.  program maintenance or debugging) have been thoroughly studied  reverse engineering diverges from these tasks as reverse engineers do not have access to developers  source code  comments  or internal documentation. Further  reverse engineers often have to overcome countermeasures employed by the developer to make the task harder (e.g.  symbol stripping  packing  obfuscation). Significant research effort has gone into providing program analysis tools to support reverse engineers. However  little work has been done to understand the way they think and analyze programs  potentially leading to the lack of adoption of these tools among practitioners. This paper reports on a first step toward better understanding the reverse engineer's process and mental models and provides directions for improving program analysis tools to better fit their users. We present the initial results of a semi-structured  observational interview study of reverse engineers (n=15). Each interview investigated the questions they asked while probing the program  how they answered these questions  and the decisions made throughout. Our initial observations suggest that reverse engineers rely on a variety of reference points in both the program text and structure as well as its dynamic behavior to build hypotheses about the program's function and identify points of interest for future exploration. In most cases  our reverse engineers used a mix of static and dynamic analysis---mostly manually---to verify these hypotheses. Throughout  they rely on intuition built up over past experience. From these observations  we provide recommendations for user interface and program analysis improvements to support the reverse engineer.
LBW2619: Exploring the Impact of Network Impairments on Remote Collaborative Augmented Reality Applications,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Tooba Ahsen  Tufts University Fahad R. Dogar  Tufts University Aaron L. Gardony  CCDC - Soldier Center & CABCS,Our research explores the impact of network impairments on remote augmented reality (AR) collaborative tasks  and possible strategies to improve user experience in these scenarios. Using a simple AR task  under a controlled network environment  our preliminary user study highlights the impact of network outages on user workload and experience  and how user roles and learning styles play a role in this regard.
LBW2620: Paired Conversational Agents for Easy-to-Understand Instruction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Wataru Akahori  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Asuka Miyake  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Hiroaki Sugiyama  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Masahiro Watanabe  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation Hiroya Minami  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,Conversational agents such as those hosted by the 'smart speakers' have become popular over the last few years. Although users can accomplish tasks as if they were asking a person  users still have problems in utilizing conversational agents effectively. To address this problem  some proposals explain how to input agent requests by using visual information such as instruction manuals and displays. However  such instructions create problems such as occupying the hands and eyes. The purpose of this study is to effectively enhance request entry by issuing instructions for use in an easy-to-understand manner without using visual information. Our proposal uses a pair of conversational agents  one is called the main agent  and the other is called the sub-agent  that have different voice types. Experiments show that agent pairing yields easier to understand instructions than using just the main agent. Furthermore  experiments also show that use instructions are easier to understand if the sub-agent reads aloud specific examples of use.
LBW2621: Wizard of Oz Prototyping for Machine Learning Experiences,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Jacob T. Browne  Twickle,Machine learning is being adopted in a wide range of products and services. Despite its adoption  design and research processes for machine learning experiences have yet to be cemented in the user experience community. Prototyping machine learning experiences is noted to be particularly challenging. This paper suggests Wizard of Oz prototyping to help designers incorporate human-centered design processes into the development of machine learning experiences. This paper also surfaces a set of topics to consider in evaluating Wizard of Oz machine learning prototypes.
LBW2622: Gender Effects on Collaborative Online Brainstorming Teamwork,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Chien Wen (Tina) Yuan  Fu Jen University Yu-Hsuan Liu  National Tsing Hua University Hao-Chuan Wang  University of California  Davis Yuan-Chi Tseng  National Tsing Hua University,It is common for individuals with diverse demographic backgrounds to collaborate through computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies. Groups with internal diversity are typically considered to be advantageous to group performance due to the presence of different perspectives and the potential to stimulate new ideas. However  intergroup conflicts can also occur in diverse groups  especially for groups with imbalanced composition. Previous studies have pointed out that minority members often suffer from unequal participation and performance pressure  which may further decrease group outcome. Since CMC tools facilitate online collaboration  it is necessary to understand how group composition interacts with the affordances of CMC tools on group collaboration. In this study  we tested three gender compositions (female-majority  equal-gender-composition  male-majority) with two communication contexts (video-text  text-only) and found that both gender composition and communication medium influenced group collaboration. Design implications for online collaboration are provided based on our findings.
LBW2710: Virtual Observation of Virtual Reality Simulations,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Scott Ronald Howie  University of the West of Scotland Marco Gilardi  University of the West of Scotland,Unlike conventional desktop simulations which have constrained interaction  immersive Virtual Reality (VR) allows users to freely move and interact with objects. In this paper we discuss a work-in-progress system that 'virtually' records participants movement and actions within a simulation. This system recovers and rebuilds recorded data on request  accurately replaying individual participants motions and actions in the simulation. Observers can review this reconstruction using an unrestricted virtual camera and if necessary  observe changes from recorded input devices. Reconstruction of each participants' skeleton structure was created using tracked input devices. We conclude that our system offers detailed recreation of high-level knowledge and visual information of participant actions during simulations.
LBW2711: On How Users Edit Computer-Generated Visual Stories,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Ting-Yao Hsu  Pennsylvania State University Yen-Chia Hsu  Carnegie Mellon University Ting-Hao (Kenneth) Huang  Pennsylvania State University,A significant body of research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has focused on generating stories automatically  either based on prior story plots or input images. However  literature has little to say about how users would receive and use these stories. Given the quality of stories generated by modern AI algorithms  users will nearly inevitably have to edit these stories before putting them to real use. In this paper  we present the first analysis of how human users edit machine-generated stories. We obtained 962 short stories generated by one of the state-of-the-art visual storytelling models. For each story  we recruited five crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to edit it. Our analysis of these edits shows that  on average  users (i) slightly shortened machine-generated stories  (ii) increased lexical diversity in these stories  and (iii) often replaced nouns and their determiners/articles with pronouns. Our study provides a better understanding on how users receive and edit machine-generated stories  informing future researchers to create more usable and helpful story generation systems.
LBW2712: Proxemo or How to Evaluate User Experience for People with Dementia,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Stephan Huber  Julius-Maximilians-Universität Alexander Bejan  Furtwangen University Beate Radzey  Demenz Support Stuttgart gGmbh Jörn Hurtienne  Julius-Maximilians-Universität,Most user experience (UX) evaluation tools require users to self-reflect and to communicate their thoughts (e.g. thinking aloud  retrospective interviews  questionnaires). In the context of designing for people with dementia  however  conditions like aphasia and general cognitive decline restrict the applicability of these methods. In this paper  we report on the iterative design of Proxemo  a smartwatch app for the documentation of observed emotions in people with dementia. Evaluations of Proxemo in dementia care facilities showed that observers considered Proxemo easy to use and preferred it over note-taking on paper. The agreement between different coders was substantial (? = .71). We conclude that Proxemo is a promising tool for UX evaluations in the dementia context – and possibly beyond  but further research on the analysis of its generated data is required.
LBW2713: Creating Manageable Persona Sets from Large User Populations,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Bernard J. Jansen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Soon-Gyo Jung  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Joni Salminen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University,Creating personas from actual online user information is an advantage of the data-driven persona approach. However  modern online systems often provide big data from millions of users that display vastly different behaviors  resulting in possibly thousands of personas representing the entire user population. We present a technique for reducing the number of personas to a smaller number that efficiently represents the complete user population  while being more manageable for end users of personas. We first isolate the key user behaviors and demographical attributes  creating thin personas  and we then apply an algorithmic cost function to collapse the set to the minimum needed to represent the whole population. We evaluate our approach on 26 million user records of a major international airline  isolating 1593 personas. Applying our approach  we collapse this number to 493  a 69% decrease in the number of personas. Our research findings have implications for organizations that have a large user population and desire to employ personas.
LBW2714: Personas Changing Over Time: Analyzing Variations of Data-Driven Personas During a Two-Year Period,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Soon-Gyo Jung  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Joni Salminen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University Bernard J. Jansen  Hamad Bin Khalifa University,One of the critiques of personas is that the underlying data that they are based on may stale  requiring further rounds of data collection. However  we could find no empirical evidence for this criticism. In this research  we collect monthly demographic data over a two-year period for a large online content publisher and generate fifteen personas each month following an identical algorithmic approach. We then compare the sets of personas month-over-month  year-over-year  and over the whole two-year period. Findings show that there is an average 18.7% change in personas monthly  a 23.3% change yearly  and a 47% change over the entire period. Findings support the critique that personas do change over time and also highlight that changes in the underlying data can occur within a relatively short period. The implication is that organizations using personas should employ ongoing data collection to detect possible persona changes.
LBW2715: Exploring Effects of Conversational Fillers on User Perception of Conversational Agents,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Yuin Jeong  Yonsei University Juho Lee  Yonsei University Youn Ah Kang  Yonsei University,Through technological advancements in various areas of our lives  Conversational Agents progressed in their human-likeness. In the field of HCI  however  the use of conversational fillers (e.g.  "um " "uh " etc.) by Conversational Agents have not been fully explored in an experimental setting. We observed the effects on user perceptions of Intelligence  Human-likeness and Likability of Conversational Agents by a 2 x 2 experimental design. From the results of 26 total participants  we concluded that 1) the use of fillers by Conversational Agents are perceived as less intelligent and less likable in task-oriented conversations  2) and the fillers did not have any statistically significant change in perception of human-likeness. However  further examination showed that users reported filler-speaking agents as more entertaining for social-oriented conversations. With these findings  we discuss design implications for voice-based Conversational Agents.
LBW2716: The Effectiveness of Nudging in Commercial Settings and Impact on User Trust,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Katarzyna Katner  City  University of London Radu Jianu  City  University of London,Persuasive technologies and nudging are increasingly used to shape user behaviors in applications ranging from health and the environment to business. A thorough understanding of the effectiveness of nudges across different contexts and whether they affect user perception of a system is still lacking. We report the results of a controlled  quantitative study with 20 participants which focused on testing the effectiveness of three different nudges in an e-commerce environment and whether their use has an impact on participants' trust. We found that products nudged via an anchoring effect were more frequently "bought" by participants  and that while participants deemed a store version implementing nudges and one which did not to be equally trustworthy  they perceived the former as technically inferior. Overall we found the effects of nudging to be less dominant than reported in previous studies.
LBW2717: Tell Me More: Understanding User Interaction of Smart Speaker News Powered by Conversational Search,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Hyunhoon Jung  NAVER Clova AI Changhoon Oh  Seoul National University Gilhwan Hwang  Seoul National University Cindy Yoonjung Oh  Seoul National University Joonhwan Lee  Seoul National University Bongwon Suh  Seoul National University,In this study  we apply a "conversational search" to the design of the news service of smart speakers so that users can actively get richer information while listening to the news. We designed a research prototype called "Anchor " where a smart speaker news assistant provides users with news about specific keywords and responds to users' questions. We recruited 21 participants and conducted a user study where they consumed the news with Anchor  followed by post hoc interviews. The results of the qualitative analysis revealed the following. (1) People preferred interactive news to news briefings. (2) People found it useful to get answers on their questions by talking with the assistant. (3) Although users were allowed to ask questions anytime  they often hesitated  as they did not want to miss the whole flow of the news. (4) However  they had difficulty recalling the questions they had not asked. Based on these findings  we discuss the implications for news design in a voice-only user interface.
LBW2718: Cross-study Reliability of the Open Card Sorting Method,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Christos Katsanos  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Nikolaos Tselios  University of Patras Nikolaos Avouris  University of Patras Stavros Demetriadis  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Ioannis Stamelos  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Lefteris Angelis  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Information architecture forms the foundation of users' navigation experience. Open card sorting is a widely-used method to create information architectures based on users' groupings of the content. However  little is known about the method's cross-study reliability: Does it produce consistent content groupings for similar profile participants involved in different card sort studies? This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the method's cross-study reliability. Six card sorts involving 140 participants were conducted: three open sorts for a travel website  and three for an eshop. Results showed that participants provided highly similar card sorting data for the same content. A rather high agreement of the produced navigation schemes was also found. These findings provide support for the cross-study reliability of the open card sorting method.
LBW2719: Synaesthetic-Translation Tool: Synaesthesia as an Interactive Material for Ideation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Chang Hee Lee  Royal College of Art Dan Lockton  Carnegie Mellon University John Stevens  Royal College of Art Stephen Jia Wang  Royal College of Art SungHee Ahn  Hongik University,While the subject of synaesthesia has inspired various practitioners and has been utilized as a design material in different formats  research has not so far presented a way to apply this captivating phenomenon as a source of design material in HCI. The purpose of this paper is to explore the translative property of synaesthesia and introduce a tangible way to use this intangible phenomenon as an interactive design material source in HCI and design. This paper shares a card-based tool that enables practitioners to use the translative property of synaesthesia for the sake of ideation. It further introduces a potential area of where this tool may be utilized for exploring user experiences. This work has implications for the CHI community as it attempts to share a practical way of using the intangible property of synaesthesia to explore potential user experiences.
LBW2720: How Performing an Activity Makes Meaning,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Eva Lenz  University of Siegen Marc Hassenzahl  University of Siegen Sarah Diefenbach  Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich,The analysis of tasks and workflows is a longstanding tradition in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In many cases  it provides a crucial basis for the usable design of interactive systems. However  established tools almost exclusively focus on task content and structure  thereby ignoring the more "experiential" aspects of task performance. To fill this gap  we combined Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) with the analysis of subjective accounts of meaning. Our explorative study (N=4) suggests that objective descriptions resulting from HTA and subjective experience of one and the same activity differ. People tend to subsume experientially unimportant sequences or even ignore these within their subjective experience. Furthermore  people are able to name experientially important sequences and to relate these to feelings and thoughts (i.e.  meaning). In the future  more refined versions of our approach may support practitioners with the design of meaningful interaction and activities.
LBW2721: Effect of Personality Traits on UX Evaluation Metrics: A Study on Usability Issues  Valence-Arousal and Skin Conductance,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Alexandros Liapis  Hellenic Open University Christos Katsanos  Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Michalis Xenos  University of Patras Theofanis Orphanoudakis  Hellenic Open University,Personality affects the way someone feels or acts. This paper examines the effect of personality traits  as operationalized by the Big-five questionnaire  on the number  type and severity of identified usability issues  physiological signals (skin conductance)  and subjective emotional ratings (valence-arousal). Twenty-four users interacted with a web service and then participated in a retrospective thinking aloud session. Results revealed that the number of usability issues is significantly affected by the Openness trait. Emotional Stability significantly affects the type of reported usability issues. Problem severity is not affected by any trait. Valence ratings are significantly affected by Conscientiousness  whereas Agreeableness  Emotional Stability and Openness significantly affect arousal ratings. Finally  Openness has a significant effect on the number of detected peaks in user's skin conductance.
LBW2722: Creating Positive Experiences with Digital Companions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Michael Burmester  Stuttgart Media University Katharina Zeiner  Siemens AG & Stuttgart Media University Katharina Schippert  Stuttgart Media University & IBM Design Studio Böblingen Axel Platz  Siemens AG,Over the last decade  advances in machine learning have multiplied the possibilities for applications of artificial intelligence. One of these applications are digital companions that assist their users in tasks and activities. In this study  we wanted to evaluate whether digital companions can be designed to create possibilities for positive experiences in work contexts and also be perceived as such using a Wizard-of-Oz prototype of a companion that supports workshop planning. We find that the work is perceived as more positive  more natural  and the content that is presented as more positive after the interaction with a companion that has been designed for positive experience compared to a neutral companion with the same functionality.
LBW2810: Minimalistic Explanations: Capturing the Essence of Decisions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Martin Schuessler  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut Philipp Weiß  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut,The use of complex machine learning models can make systems opaque to users. Machine learning research proposes the use of post-hoc explanations. However  it is unclear if they give users insights into otherwise uninterpretable models. One minimalistic way of explaining image classifications by a deep neural network is to show only the areas that were decisive for the assignment of a label. In a pilot study  20 participants looked at 14 of such explanations generated either by a human or the LIME algorithm. For explanations of correct decisions  they identified the explained object with significantly higher accuracy (75.64 % vs. 18.52 %). We argue that this shows that explanations can be very minimalistic while retaining the essence of a decision  but the decision-making contexts that can be conveyed in this manner is limited. Finally  we found that explanations are unique to the explainer and human-generated explanations were assigned 79 % higher trust ratings. As a starting point for further studies  this work shares our first insights into quality criteria of post-hoc explanations.
LBW2811: Studying User Experience of a Hybrid Location Sensing System,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Yun Huang  Syracuse University Yisi Sang  Syracuse University Qunfang Wu  Syracuse University Yaxing Yao  Syracuse University,The HCI community has extensively studied location-based systems that applied various location sensing technologies. However  there is a lack of user experience (UX) studies of systems where hybrid location sensing approaches are provided. In this work  we designed  implemented and studied a hybrid location sharing system that offers automatic location sensing through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and participatory location sharing using GPS. Our findings provide design implications to future location-based systems that apply such a hybrid location sensing design.
LBW2812: Effects of Influence on User Trust in Predictive Decision Making,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Jianlong Zhou  University of Technology Sydney Zhidong Li  University of Technology Sydney Huaiwen Hu  DATA61  CSIRO Kun Yu  University of Technology Sydney Fang Chen  University of Technology Sydney Zelin Li  DATA61  CSIRO Yang Wang  University of Technology Sydney,This paper introduces fact-checking into Machine Learning (ML) explanation by referring training data points as facts to users to boost user trust. We aim to investigate what influence of training data points  and how they affect user trust in order to enhance ML explanation and boost user trust. We tackle this question by allowing users check the training data points that have the higher influence and the lower influence on the prediction. A user study found that the presentation of influences significantly increases the user trust in predictions  but only for training data points with higher influence values under the high model performance condition  where users can justify their actions with more similar facts.
LBW2822: Do We Need Natural Language? Exploring Restricted Language Interfaces for Complex Domains,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 15:20:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 16:00,Hall 4,Jesse Mu  Stanford University Advait Sarkar  Microsoft Research,Natural language interfaces (NLIs) that aim to understand arbitrary language are not only difficult to engineer; they can also create unrealistic expectations of the capabilities of the system  resulting in user confusion and disappointment. We use an interactive language learning game in a 3D blocks world to examine whether limiting a user's communication to a small set of artificial utterances is an acceptable alternative to the much harder task of accepting unrestricted language. We find that such a restricted language interface provides same or better performance on this task while improving user experience indices. This suggests that some NLIs can restrict user languages without sacrificing user experience and highlights the importance of conveying NLI limitations to users.
Investigating Implicit Gender Bias and Embodiment of White Males in Virtual Reality with Full Body Visuomotor Synchrony,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Alsh 1,Sarah Lopez  University of San Francisco Yi Yang  University of San Francisco Kevin Beltran  University of San Francisco Soo Jung Kim  University of San Francisco Jennifer Cruz Hernandez  University of San Francisco Chelsy Simran  University of San Francisco Bingkun Yang  University of San Francisco Beste F. Yuksel  University of San Francisco,Previous research has shown that when White people embody a black avatar in virtual reality (VR) with full body visuomotor synchrony  this can reduce their implicit racial bias. In this paper  we put men in female and male avatars in VR with full visuomotor synchrony using wearable trackers and investigated implicit gender bias and embodiment. We found that participants embodied in female avatars displayed significantly higher levels of implicit gender bias than those embodied in male avatars. The implicit gender bias actually increased after exposure to female embodiment in contrast to male embodiment. Results also showed that participants felt embodied in their avatars regardless of gender matching  demonstrating that wearable trackers can be used for a realistic sense of avatar embodiment in VR. We discuss the future implications of these findings for both VR scenarios and embodiment technologies.
Detecting Personality Traits Using Eye-Tracking Data,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Alsh 1,Shlomo Berkovsky  Data61 - CSIRO & Macquarie University Ronnie Taib  Data61 - CSIRO Irena Koprinska  University of Sydney Eileen Wang  University of Sydney Yucheng Zeng  University of Sydney Jingjie Li  University of Wisconsin–Madison Sabina Kleitman  University of Sydney,Personality is an established domain of research in psychology  and individual differences in various traits are linked to a variety of real-life outcomes and behaviours. Personality detection is an intricate task that typically requires humans to fill out lengthy questionnaires assessing specific personality traits. The outcomes of this  however  may be unreliable or biased if the respondents do not fully understand or are not willing to honestly answer the questions. To this end  we propose a framework for objective personality detection that leverages humans' physiological responses to external stimuli. We exemplify and evaluate the framework in a case study  where we expose subjects to affective image and video stimuli  and capture their physiological responses using a commercial-grade eye-tracking sensor. These responses are then processed and fed into a classifier capable of accurately predicting a range of personality traits. Our work yields notably high predictive accuracy  suggesting the applicability of the proposed framework for robust personality detection.
As Light as You Aspire to Be: Changing Body Perception with Sound to Support Physical Activity,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Alsh 1,Ana Tajadura-Jiménez  Universidad Carlos III de Madrid Joseph Newbold  University College London Linge Zhang  University College London Patricia Rick  Universidad Loyola Andalucía Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze  University College London,Supporting exercise adherence through technology remains an important HCI challenge. Recent works showed that altering walking sounds leads people perceiving themselves as thinner/lighter  happier and walking more dynamically. While this novel approach shows potential for physical activity  it raises critical questions impacting technology design. We ran two studies in the context of exertion (gym-step  stairs-climbing) to investigate how individual factors impact the effect of sound and the duration of the after-effects. The results confirm that the effects of sound in body-perception occur even in physically demanding situations and through ubiquitous wearable devices. We also show that the effect of sound interacted with participants' body weight and masculinity/femininity aspirations  but not with gender. Additionally  changes in body-perceptions did not hold once the feedback stopped; however  body-feelings or behavioural changes appeared to persist for longer. We discuss the results in terms of malleability of body-perception and highlight opportunities for supporting exercise adherence.
MindDot: Supporting Effective Cognitive Behaviors in Concept Map-Based Learning Environments,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Shang Wang  Arizona State University Deniz Sonmez Unal  University of Pittsburgh Erin Walker  University of Pittsburgh,While prior research has revealed the promising impact of concept mapping on learning  few have comprehensively modeled different cognitive behaviors during concept mapping. In addition  existing concept mapping tools lack effective feedback to support better learning behaviors. This work presents MindDot  a concept map-based learning environment that facilitates the cognitive process of comparing and integrating related concepts via two forms of support. A hyperlink support and an expert template. Study results suggested that both types of support had positive impact on the development of comparative strategies and that hyperlink support enhanced learning. We further evaluated the cognitive learning progress at a fine-grained level with two forms of visualizations. We then extracted several behavioral patterns that provided insights about the cognitive progress in learning. Lastly  we derive design recommendations that we hope will inspire future intelligent tutoring systems that automatically evaluate students' learning behaviors and foster them in developing effective learning behaviors
QuizBot: A Dialogue-based Adaptive Learning System for Factual Knowledge,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Sherry Ruan  Stanford University Liwei Jiang  Colby College Justin Xu  Stanford University Bryce Joe-Kun Tham  Stanford University Zhengneng Qiu  HCI Yeshuang Zhu  Tsinghua University Elizabeth Murnane  Stanford University Emma Brunskill  Stanford University James A. Landay  Stanford University,Advances in conversational AI have the potential to enable more engaging and effective ways to teach factual knowledge. To investigate this hypothesis  we created QuizBot  a dialogue-based agent that helps students learn factual knowledge in science  safety  and English vocabulary. We evaluated QuizBot with 76 students through two within-subject studies against a flashcard app  the traditional medium for learning factual knowledge. Though both systems used the same algorithm for sequencing materials  QuizBot led to students recognizing (and recalling) over 20% more correct answers than when students used the flashcard app. Using a conversational agent is more time consuming to practice with  but in a second study  of their own volition  students spent 2.6x more time learning with QuizBot than with flashcards and reported preferring it strongly for casual learning. Our results in this second study showed QuizBot yielded improved learning gains over flashcards on recall. These results suggest that educational chatbot systems may have beneficial use  particularly for learning outside of traditional settings.
Teachers' Expected and Perceived Gains of Participation in Classroom Based Design Activities,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Peter Börjesson  University of Gothenburg & Chalmers University of Technology Wolmet Barendregt  University of Gothenburg Eva Eriksson  Aarhus University & Chalmers University of Technology Olof Torgersson  University of Gothenburg & Chalmers University of Technology Tilde Bekker  Eindhoven University of Technology,This paper explores teachers' expected and perceived gains from classroom participation in design projects. The results indicate that teachers hope the experience will be fun for the children  and that it will increase both children's and their own knowledge about technology. Although they consider learning goals important  these do not necessarily have to be communicated to the children  since the teachers experience that the children are learning several skills anyway. However  early involvement in the definition of learning goals could make participation more beneficial. The teachers also see several gains from partication for themselves  especially related to using a design approach in the classroom. We discuss the implications of these finding and suggest a way to increase the user gains for both children and teachers by considering the opportunity to use classroom participation as a way to support teachers' competence development  thereby fulfilling the promise of mutual learning as advocated in Participatory Design.
"What's Happening at that Hip?": Evaluating an On-body Projection based Augmented Reality System for Physiotherapy Classroom,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Hasan Shahid Ferdous  University of Melbourne Thuong Hoang  Deakin University Zaher Joukhadar  University of Melbourne Martin N. Reinoso  University of Melbourne Frank Vetere  University of Melbourne David Kelly  University of Melbourne Louisa Remedios  University of Melbourne,We present two studies to discuss the design  usability analysis  and educational outcome resulting from our system Augmented Body in physiotherapy classroom. We build on prior user-centric design work that investigates existing teaching methods and discuss opportunities for intervention. We present the design and implementation of a hybrid system for physiotherapy education combining an on-body projection based virtual anatomy supplemented by pen-based tablets to create real-time annotations. We conducted a usability evaluation of this system  comparing with projection only and traditional teaching conditions. Finally  we focus on a comparative study to evaluate learning outcome among students in actual classroom settings. Our studies showed increased usage of visual representation techniques in students'11 note taking behavior and statistically significant improvement in some learning aspects. We discuss challenges for designing augmented reality systems for education  including minimizing attention split  addressing text-entry issues  and digital annotations on a moving physical body.
Moving Beyond " Great Screen Time Debate" in the Design of Technology for Children,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Alexis Hiniker  University of Washington Jenny S. Radesky  University of Michigan Sonia Livingstone  London School of Economics & Political Science Alicia Blum-Ross  Google  Inc.,Despite pervasive messaging about the dangers of "screen time " children and families remain avid consumers of digital media and other technologies. Given competing narratives heralding the promise or the peril of children's technology  how can designers best serve this audience? In this panel  we bring together world experts from: children's media and communications  pediatrics and human development  HCI and design  and industry product development to debate the validity of pundits' concerns and discuss designers' opportunities and obligations with respect to creating products for this user group. Panelists bring diverse--and sometimes conflicting--perspectives on the conceptual frameworks that are most appropriate for understanding family technology use  the ethical considerations designers should bring to this space  and the most pressing needs for future research. Grounding the conversation in guidance from the audience  panelists will share their visions for a research agenda that separates moral panics from credible concerns and promotes the design of positive digital experiences for children and families.
Computational Interaction with Bayesian Methods,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge Nikola Banovic  University of Michigan Antti Oulasvirta  Aalto University John Williamson  University of Glasgow,This course introduces computational methods in human--computer interaction. Computational interaction methods use computational thinking---abstraction  automation  and analysis---to explain and enhance interaction. This course introduces the theory of practice of computational interaction by teaching Bayesian methods for interaction across four wide areas of interest when designing computationally-driven user interfaces: decoding  adaptation  learning and optimization. The lectures center on hands-on Python programming interleaved with theory and practical examples grounded in problems of wide interest in human-computer interaction.

Feeling Fireworks: An Inclusive Tactile Firework Display,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Dorothea Reusser  Disney Research & ETH Zurich Espen Knoop  Disney Research Roland Siegwart  ETH Zürich Paul Beardsley  Disney Research,This paper presents a novel design for a large-scale interactive tactile display. Fast dynamic tactile effects are created at high spatial resolution on a flexible screen  using directable nozzles that spray water jets onto the rear of the screen. The screen further has back-projected visual content and touch interaction. The technology is demonstrated in Feeling Fireworks  a tactile firework show. The goal is to make fireworks more inclusive for the Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) community. A BLV focus group provided input during the development process  and a user study with BLV users showed that Feeling Fireworks is an enjoyable and meaningful experience. A user study with sighted users showed that users could accurately label the correspondence between the designed tactile firework effects and corresponding visual fireworks. Beyond the Feeling Fireworks application  this is a novel approach for scalable tactile displays with potential for broader use.
Editing Spatial Layouts through Tactile Templates for People with Visual Impairments,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Jingyi Li  Stanford University Son Kim  Vista Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired Joshua A. Miele  The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute Maneesh Agrawala  Stanford University Sean Follmer  Stanford University,Spatial layout is a key component in graphic design. While people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) can use screen readers or magnifiers to access digital content  these tools fail to fully communicate the content's graphic design information. Through semi-structured interviews and contextual inquiries  we identify the lack of this information and feedback as major challenges in understanding and editing layouts. Guided by these insights and a co-design process with a blind hobbyist web developer  we developed an interactive  multimodal authoring tool that lets blind people understand spatial relationships between elements and modify layout templates. Our tool automatically generates tactile print-outs of a web page's layout  which users overlay on top of a tablet that runs our self-voicing digital design tool. We conclude with design considerations grounded in user feedback for improving the accessibility of spatially encoded information and developing tools for BVI authors.
BBeep: A Sonic Collision Avoidance System for Blind Travellers and Nearby Pedestrians,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Seita Kayukawa  Carnegie Mellon University & Waseda University Keita Higuchi  University of Tokyo João Guerreiro  Carnegie Mellon University Shigeo Morishima  Waseda Research Institute for Science and Engineering Yoichi Sato  University of Tokyo Kris Kitani  Carnegie Mellon University Chieko Asakawa  Carnegie Mellon University & IBM Research,We present an assistive suitcase system  BBeep  for supporting blind people when walking through crowded environments. BBeep uses pre-emptive sound notifications to help clear a path by alerting both the user and nearby pedestrians about the potential risk of collision. BBeep triggers notifications by tracking pedestrians  predicting their future position in real-time  and provides sound notifications only when it anticipates a future collision. We investigate how different types and timings of sound affect nearby pedestrian behavior. In our experiments  we found that sound emission timing has a significant impact on nearby pedestrian trajectories when compared to different sound types. Based on these findings  we performed a real-world user study at an international airport  where blind participants navigated with the suitcase in crowded areas. We observed that the proposed system significantly reduces the number of imminent collisions.
Haptic Navigation Cues on the Steering Wheel,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Patrizia Di Campli San Vito  University of Glasgow Gözel Shakeri  University of Glasgow Stephen Brewster  University of Glasgow Frank Pollick  University of Glasgow Edward Brown  Jaguar Land Rover Ltd. Lee Skrypchuk  Jaguar Land Rover Ltd. Alexandros Mouzakitis  Jaguar Land Rover Ltd.,Haptic feedback is used in cars to reduce visual inattention. While tactile feedback like vibration can be influenced by the car's movement  thermal and cutaneous push feedback should be independent of such interference. This paper presents two driving simulator studies investigating novel tactile feedback on the steering wheel for navigation. First  devices on one side of the steering wheel were warmed  indicating the turning direction  while those on the other side were cooled. This thermal feedback was compared to audio. The thermal navigation lead to 94.2% correct recognitions of warnings 200m before the turn and to 91.7% correct turns. Speech had perfect recognition for both. In the second experiment  only the destination side was indicated thermally  and this design was compared to cutaneous push feedback. The simplified thermal feedback design did not increase recognition  but cutaneous push feedback had high recognition rates (100% for 200 m warnings  98% for turns).
Tracking the Consumption of Home Essentials,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Carolina Fuentes  University of Nottingham Martin Porcheron  University of Nottingham Joel Fischer  University of Nottingham Enrico Costanza  University College London Obaid Malilk  University of Southampton Sarvapali D. Ramchurn  University of Southampton,Predictions of people's behaviour increasingly drive interactions with a new generation of IoT services designed to support everyday life in the home  from shopping to heating. Based on the premise that such automation is difficult due to the contingent nature of people's practices  in this work we explore the nature of these contingencies in depth. We have designed and conducted a technology probe that made use of simple linear predictions as a provocation  and invited people to track the life of their household essentials over a two-month period. Through a mixed-method approach we demonstrate the challenges of simple predictions  and in turn identify eight categories of contingencies that influenced prediction accuracy. We discuss strategies for how designers of future predictive IoT systems may take the contingencies into account by removing  hiding  revealing  managing  or exploiting the system uncertainty at the core of the issue.
Alternative Avenues for IoT: Designing with Non-Stereotypical Homes,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Audrey Desjardins  University of Washington Jeremy E. Viny  University of Washington Cayla Key  University of Washington Nouela Johnston  University of Washington,We report on the findings of a co-speculative design inquiry that investigates alternative visions of the Internet of Things (IoT) for the home. We worked with 16 people living in non-stereotypical homes to develop situated and personal concepts attuned to their home. As a prompt for co-speculation and discussion  we created handmade booklets where we took turns overlaying sketched design concepts on top of photos taken with participants in their homes. Our findings reveal new avenues for the design of IoT systems such as: acknowledging porous boundaries of the home  exposing neighborly relations  exploring diverse timescales  revisiting agency  and embracing imaginary and potential uses. We invite human-computer interaction and design researchers to use these avenues as starting points to broaden current assumptions embedded in design and research practices for domestic technologies. We conclude by highlighting the value of examining divergent perspectives and surfacing the unseen.
"Collective Wisdom": Inquiring into Collective Homes as a Site for HCI Design,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Jo Shin  Simon Fraser University Gabriela Aceves Sepúlveda  Simon Fraser University William Odom  Simon Fraser University,The home has been a major focus of the HCI community for over two decades. Despite this body of research  nascent works have argued that HCI's characterization of 'the home' remains narrow and requires more diverse accounts of domestic configurations. Our work contributes to this area through a four-month ethnography of three collective homes in Vancouver  Canada. Collective homes represent an alternative housing model that offers agency to individual members and the collective group by sharing values  resources  labour  space and memory. Our paper offers two contributions. First  we offer an in-depth design ethnography of three collective homes  attending to the values  ownership models  practices  and everyday interactions observed in the ongoing making of these domestic settings. Second  we interpret and synthesize our findings to provide new opportunities for expanding the way we conceptualize and design for 'the home' in HCI.
Who's In Control? Interactions In Multi-User Smart Homes,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Christine Geeng  University of Washington Franziska Roesner  University of Washington,Adoption of commercial smart home devices is rapidly increasing  allowing in-situ research in people's homes. As these technologies are deployed in shared spaces  we seek to understand interactions among multiple people and devices in a smart home. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 18 participants (primarily people who drive smart device adoption in their homes) living in multi-user smart homes  combining semi-structured interviews and experience sampling. Our findings surface tensions and cooperation among users in several phases of smart device use: device selection and installation  ordinary use  when the smart home does not work as expected  and over longer term use. We observe an outsized role of the person who installs devices in terms of selecting  controlling  and fixing them; negotiations between parents and children; and minimally voiced privacy concerns among co-occupants  possibly due to participant sampling. We make design recommendations for supporting long-term smart homes and non-expert household members.
Transformation through Provocation?,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Maria Roussou  National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Sara Perry  The University of York Akrivi Katifori  Athena Research Center & National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Stavros Vassos  Helvia Technologies Angeliki Tzouganatou  University of Hamburg Sierra McKinney  The University of York,Can a chatbot enable us to change our conceptions  to be critically reflective? To what extent can interaction with a technologically 'minimal' medium such as a chatbot evoke emotional engagement in ways that can challenge us to act on the world? In this paper  we discuss the design of a provocative bot  a 'bot of conviction'  aimed at triggering conversations on complex topics (e.g. death  wealth distribution  gender equality  privacy) and  ultimately  soliciting specific actions from the user it converses with. We instantiate our design with a use case in the cultural sector  specifically a Neolithic archaeological site that acts as a stage of conversation on such hard themes. Our larger contributions include an interaction framework for bots of conviction  insights gained from an iterative process of participatory design and evaluation  and a vision for bot interaction mechanisms that can apply to the HCI community more widely.
Beyond Dyadic Interactions: Considering Chatbots as Community Members,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Joseph Seering  Carnegie Mellon University Michal Luria  Carnegie Mellon University Geoff Kaufman  Carnegie Mellon University Jessica Hammer  Carnegie Mellon University,Chatbots have grown as a space for research and development in recent years due both to the realization of their commercial potential and to advancements in language processing that have facilitated more natural conversations. However  nearly all chatbots to date have been designed for dyadic  one-on-one communication with users. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of research on chatbots supplemented by a review of commercial and independent chatbots. We argue that chatbots' social roles and conversational capabilities beyond dyadic interactions have been underexplored  and that expansion into this design space could support richer social interactions in online communities and help address the longstanding challenges of maintaining  moderating  and growing these communities. In order to identify opportunities beyond dyadic interactions  we used research-through-design methods to generate more than 400 concepts for new social chatbots  and we present seven categories that emerged from analysis of these ideas.
Comparing Data from Chatbot and Web Surveys: Effects of Platform and Conversational Style on Survey Response Quality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Soomin Kim  Seoul National University Joonhwan Lee  Seoul National University Gahgene Gweon  Seoul National University,This study aims to explore the feasibility of a text-based virtual agent as a new survey method to overcome the web survey's common response quality problems  which are caused by respondents' inattention. To this end  we conducted a 2 (platform: web vs. chatbot) × 2 (conversational style: formal vs. casual) experiment. We used satisficing theory to compare the responses' data quality. We found that the participants in the chatbot survey  as compared to those in the web survey  were more likely to produce differentiated responses and were less likely to satisfice; the chatbot survey thus resulted in higher-quality data. Moreover  when a casual conversational style is used  the participants were less likely to satisfice–although such effects were only found in the chatbot condition. These results imply that conversational interactivity occurs when a chat interface is accompanied by messages with effective tone. Based on an analysis of the qualitative responses  we also showed that a chatbot could perform part of a human interviewer's role by applying effective communication strategies.
Co-Performing Agent: Design for Building User-Agent Partnership in Learning and Adaptive Services,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Da-jung Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Youn-kyung Lim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Intelligent agents have become prevalent in everyday IT products and services. To improve an agent's knowledge of a user and the quality of personalized service experience  it is important for the agent to cooperate with the user (e.g.  asking users to provide their information and feedback). However  few works inform how to support such user-agent co-performance from a human-centered perspective. To fill this gap  we devised Co-Performing Agent  a Wizard-of-Oz-based research probe of an agent that cooperates with a user to learn by helping users to have a partnership mindset. By incorporating the probe  we conducted a two-month exploratory study  aiming to understand how users experience co-performing with their agent over time. Based on the findings  this paper presents the factors that affected users' co-performing behaviors and discusses design implications for supporting constructive co-performance and building a resilient user–agent partnership over time.
Building Economic Models of Human Computer Interaction,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Leif Azzopardi  University of Strathclyde Guido Zuccon  University of Queensland,Economics provides an intuitive and natural way to formally represent the cost and benefits of interacting with applications  interfaces and devices. By using economics models it is possible to reason about interaction and make predictions about how changes to the system will affect performance and behavior. In this course  we provided an overview of relevant economic concepts and then showed how economics can be used to model human computer interaction to generated hypotheses about interaction which can be used to inform design and guide experimentation. As a case study  we demonstrate how various interactions with search and recommender applications can be modeled  before concluding the day with a hands-on modeling session using example and participant problems.
Tangible Ecosystem Design – Developing Disruptive Services for Digital Ecosystems,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Claudia Nass Bauer  Fraunhofer IESE Marcus Trapp  Fraunhofer IESE,The epoch of the platform economy has arrived. Companies face the question of how to build up disruptive digital services with disruptive business models and establish a digital ecosystem. Traditional UCD methods concentrate on the conception of particular services. Nevertheless  most of these are isolated solutions of single companies. Building services for the digital transformation era requires additional methods to come up with end-to-end consumer experiences and sustainable business models across boundaries of single companies for benefiting consumers. In this course participants learn the "Tangible Ecosystem Design" Method (TED)  that supports the conception of Digital Ecosystems by using tangible elements.
NVGaze: An Anatomically-Informed Dataset for Low-Latency  Near-Eye Gaze Estimation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Joohwan Kim  NVIDIA Michael Stengel  NVIDIA Alexander Majercik  NVIDIA Shalini De Mello  NVIDIA David Dunn  University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill Samuli Laine  NVIDIA Morgan McGuire  NVIDIA David Luebke  NVIDIA,Quality  diversity  and size of training data are critical factors for learning-based gaze estimators. We create two datasets satisfying these criteria for near-eye gaze estimation under infrared illumination: a synthetic dataset using anatomically-informed eye and face models with variations in face shape  gaze direction  pupil and iris  skin tone  and external conditions (2M images at 1280x960)  and a real-world dataset collected with 35 subjects (2.5M images at 640x480). Using these datasets we train neural networks performing with sub-millisecond latency. Our gaze estimation network achieves 2.06(±0.44)° of accuracy across a wide 30°×40° field of view on real subjects excluded from training and 0.5° best-case accuracy (across the same FOV) when explicitly trained for one real subject. We also train a pupil localization network which achieves higher robustness than previous methods.
Evaluation of Appearance-Based Methods and Implications for Gaze-Based Applications,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Xucong Zhang  Saarland Informatics Campus Yusuke Sugano  Osaka University Andreas Bulling  University of Stuttgart,Appearance-based gaze estimation methods that only require an off-the-shelf camera have significantly improved but they are still not yet widely used in the human-computer interaction (HCI) community. This is partly because it remains unclear how they perform compared to model-based approaches as well as dominant  special-purpose eye tracking equipment. To address this limitation  we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art appearance-based gaze estimation for interaction scenarios with and without personal calibration  indoors and outdoors  for different sensing distances  as well as for users with and without glasses. We discuss the obtained findings and their implications for the most important gaze-based applications  namely explicit eye input  attentive user interfaces  gaze-based user modelling  and passive eye monitoring. To democratise the use of appearance-based gaze estimation and interaction in HCI  we finally present OpenGaze (www.opengaze.org)  the first software toolkit for appearance-based gaze estimation and interaction.
"Like Popcorn": Crossmodal Correspondences Between Scents  3D Shapes and Emotions in Children,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Oussama Metatla  University of Bristol Emanuela Maggioni  University of Sussex Clare Cullen  University of Bristol Marianna Obrist  University of Sussex,There is increasing interest in multisensory experiences in HCI. However  little research considers how sensory modalities interact with each other and how this may impact interactive experiences. We investigate how children associate emotions with scents and 3D shapes. 14 participants (10-17yrs) completed crossmodal association tasks to attribute emotional characteristics to variants of the "Bouba/Kiki" stimuli  presented as 3D tangible models  in conjunction with lemon and vanilla scents. Our findings support pre-existing mappings between shapes and scents  and confirm the associations between the combination of angular shapes ("Kiki") and lemon scent with arousing emotion  and of round shapes ("Bouba") and vanilla scent with calming emotion. This extends prior work on crossmodal correspondences in terms of stimuli (3D as opposed to 2D shapes)  sample (children)  and conveyed content (emotions). We outline how these findings can contribute to designing more inclusive interactive multisensory technologies.
360proto: Making Interactive Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality Prototypes from Paper,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Michael Nebeling  University of Michigan Katy Madier  University of Michigan,We explore 360 paper prototyping to rapidly create AR/VR prototypes from paper and bring them to life on AR/VR devices. Our approach is based on a set of emerging paper prototyping templates specifically for AR/VR. These templates resemble the key components of many AR/VR interfaces  including 2D representations of immersive environments  AR marker overlays and face masks  VR controller models and menus  and 2D screens and HUDs. To make prototyping with these templates effective  we developed 360proto  a suite of three novel physical--digital prototyping tools: (1) the 360proto Camera for capturing paper mockups of all components simply by taking a photo with a smartphone and seeing 360-degree panoramic previews on the phone or stereoscopic previews in Google Cardboard; (2) the 360proto Studio for organizing and editing captures  for composing AR/VR interfaces by layering the captures  and for making them interactive with Wizard of Oz via live video streaming; (3) the 360proto App for running and testing the interactive prototypes on AR/VR capable mobile devices and headsets. Through five student design jams with a total of 86 participants and our own design space explorations  we demonstrate that our approach with 360proto is useful to create relatively complex AR/VR applications.
Towards Understanding the Link Between Age and Smartphone Authentication,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Lina Qiu  University of British Columbia Alexander De Luca  Google Ildar Muslukhov  University of British Columbia Konstantin Beznosov  University of British Columbia,While previous work on smartphone (un)locking has revealed real world usage patterns  several aspects still need to be explored. In this paper  we fill one of these knowledge gaps: the interplay between age and smartphone authentication behavior. To do this  we performed a two-month long field study (N = 134). Our results indicate that there are indeed significant differences across age. For instance  younger participants were more likely to use biometric unlocking mechanisms and older participants relied more on auto locks.
Vulnerability & Blame: Making Sense of Unauthorized Access to Smartphones,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Diogo Marques  Universidade de Lisboa Tiago Guerreiro  Universidade de Lisboa Luis Carriço  Universidade de Lisboa Ivan Beschastnikh  University of British Columbia Konstantin Beznosov  University of British Columbia,Unauthorized physical access to personal devices by people known to the owner of the device is a common concern  and a common occurrence. But how do people experience incidents of unauthorized access? Using an online survey  we collected 102 accounts of unauthorized access. Participants wrote stories about past situations in which either they accessed the smartphone of someone they know  or someone they know accessed theirs. We describe the context leading up to these incidents  the course of events  and the consequences. We then identify two orthogonal themes in how participants conceptualized these incidents. First  participants understood trust as performative vulnerability: trust was necessary to sustain relationships  but building trust required displaying vulnerability to breaches. Second  participants were self-serving in their sensemaking: they blamed the circumstances  or the other person's shortcomings  but rarely themselves. We discuss the implications of our findings for security design and practice.
Passquerade: Improving Error Correction of Text Passwords on Mobile Devices by using Graphic Filters for Password Masking,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Mohamed Khamis  University of Glasgow & Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Tobias Seitz  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Leonhard Mertl  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Alice Nguyen  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Mario Schneller  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Zhe Li  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich,Entering text passwords on mobile devices is a significant challenge. Current systems either display passwords in plain text: making them visible to bystanders  or replace characters with asterisks shortly after they are typed: making editing them harder. This work presents a novel approach to mask text passwords by distorting them using graphical filters. Distorted passwords are difficult to observe by attackers because they cannot mentally reverse the distortions. Yet passwords remain readable by their owners because humans can recognize visually distorted versions of content they saw before. We present results of an online questionnaire and a user study where we compared Color-halftone  Crystallize  Blurring  and Mosaic filters to Plain text and Asterisks when 1) entering  2) editing  and 3) shoulder surfing one-word passwords  random character passwords  and passphrases. Rigorous analysis shows that Color-halftone and Crystallize filters significantly improve editing speed  editing accuracy and observation resistance compared to current approaches.
"Pretty Close to a Must-Have:" Balancing Usability Desire and Security Concern in Biometric Adoption,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Flynn Wolf  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Ravi Kuber  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Adam J. Aviv  United States Naval Academy,We report on a qualitative inquiry among security-expert and non-expert mobile device users about the adoption of biometric authentication using semi-structured interviews(n=38  19/19 expert/non-expert). Security experts more readily adopted biometrics than non-experts but also harbored greater distrust towards its use for sensitive transactions feared biometric signature compromise  and in some cases distrusted newer facial recognition methods. Both groups harbored misconceptions  such as misunderstanding of the functional role of biometrics in authentication  and were about equally likely to have stopped using biometrics due to usability. Implications include the need for tailored training for security-informed advocates  better design for device sharing and co-registration  and consideration for usability needs in work environments. Refinement of these features would remove perceived obstacles to ubiquitous computing among the growing population of mobile technology users sensitized to security risk.
Does Being Verified Make You More Credible? Account Verification's Effect on Tweet Credibility,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Tavish Vaidya  Georgetown University Daniel Votipka  University of Maryland  College Park Michelle L. Mazurek  University of Maryland  College Park Micah Sherr  Georgetown University,Many popular social networking and microblogging sites support verified accounts---user accounts that are deemed of public interest and whose owners have been authenticated by the site. Importantly  the content of messages contributed by verified account owners is not verified. Such messages may be factually correct  or not. This paper investigates whether users confuse authenticity with credibility by posing the question: Are users more likely to believe content from verified accounts than from non-verified accounts? We conduct two online studies  a year apart  with 748 and 2041 participants respectively  to assess how the presence or absence of verified account indicators influences users' perceptions of tweets. Surprisingly  across both studies  we find that---in the context of unfamiliar accounts---most users can effectively distinguish between authenticity and credibility. The presence or absence of an authenticity indicator has no significant effect on willingness to share a tweet or take action based on its contents.
Can Privacy Be Satisfying? On Improving Viewer Satisfaction for Privacy-Enhanced Photos Using Aesthetic Transforms,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Rakibul Hasan  Indiana University Yifang Li  Clemson University Eman Hassan  Indiana University Kelly Caine  Clemson University David J. Crandall  Indiana University Roberto Hoyle  Oberlin College Apu Kapadia  Indiana University,Pervasive photo sharing in online social media platforms can cause unintended privacy violations when elements of an image reveal sensitive information. Prior studies have identified image obfuscation methods (e.g.  blurring) to enhance privacy  but many of these methods adversely affect viewers' satisfaction with the photo  which may cause people to avoid using them. In this paper  we study the novel hypothesis that it may be possible to restore viewers' satisfaction by 'boosting' or enhancing the aesthetics of an obscured image  thereby compensating for the negative effects of a privacy transform. Using a between-subjects online experiment  we studied the effects of three artistic transformations on images that had objects obscured using three popular obfuscation methods validated by prior research. Our findings suggest that using artistic transformations can mitigate some negative effects of obfuscation methods  but more exploration is needed to retain viewer satisfaction.
I Don't Even Have to Bother Them!: Using Social Media to Automate the Authentication Ceremony in Secure Messaging,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Elham Vaziripour  Brigham Young University Devon Howard  Brigham Young University Jake Tyler  Brigham Young University Mark O'Neill  Brigham Young University Justin Wu  Brigham Young University Kent Seamons  Brigham Young University Daniel Zappala  Brigham Young University,The privacy guaranteed by secure messaging applications relies on users completing an authentication ceremony to verify they are using the proper encryption keys. We examine the feasibility of social authentication  which partially automates the ceremony using social media accounts. We implemented social authentication in Signal and conducted a within-subject user study with 42 participants to compare this with existing methods. To generalize our results  we conducted a Mechanical Turk survey involving 421 respondents. Our results show that users found social authentication to be convenient and fast. They particularly liked verifying keys asynchronously  and viewing social media profiles naturally coincided with how participants thought of verification. However  some participants reacted negatively to integrating social media with Signal  primarily because they distrust social media services. Overall  automating the authentication ceremony and distributing trust with additional service providers is promising  but this infrastructure needs to be more trusted than social media companies.
Techies Against Facebook: Understanding Negative Sentiment Toward Facebook via User Generated Content,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Abu Saleh Md Noman  Indiana University Sanchari Das  Indiana University Bloomington Sameer Patil  Indiana University Bloomington,Researchers have recognized the need to pay attention to negative aspects and non-use of social media services to uncover usage barriers and surface shortcomings of these systems. We contribute to these efforts by analyzing comments on posts related to Facebook on two blogs with a technically savvy readership: Slashdot and Schneier on Security. Our analysis indicates that technically savvy individuals exhibit notably large negative sentiment toward Facebook with nearly 45% of the 3 000 reader comments we coded expressing such views. Qualitative coding revealed Privacy and Security  User Experience  and Personal Disposition as key factors underlying the negative views. Our findings suggest that negative sentiment is an explicit higher level factor driving non-use practices. Further  we confirm several non-use practices reported in the literature and identify additional aspects connected to recent technological and societal developments. Our results demonstrate that analysis of user generated content can be useful for surfacing usage practices on a large scale.

Older Voices: Supporting Community Radio Production for Civic Participation in Later Life,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Gala,Arlind Reuter  Newcastle University Tom Bartindale  Monash University Kellie Morrissey  Newcastle University Thomas Scharf  Newcastle University Jennifer Liddle  Newcastle University,Community radio can support the process of having a voice in one's community as a part of civic action  and promote community dialogue. However  older adults are underrepresented as producers of community radio shows in the UK  and face different challenges to their younger colleagues. By working within the radio production group of an existing organisation of older adults  we identify the motivations and challenges in supporting this type of civic participation in media in later life. Key challenges were identified  including audience engagement  content persistence and process sustainability. In response  we 1) supported the group's audience engagement using Facebook Live and a phone-in option  and 2) developed a digital production tool. Reporting on the continued use of the tool by the organisation  we discuss how tailored and non-intrusive processes mediated by digital technology can support older adults in delivering richer media experiences whilst serving their civic participatory interests.
JourneyCam: Exploring Experiences of Accessibility and Mobility among Powered Wheelchair Users through Video and Data,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Gala,Sunil Rodger  Newcastle University Dan Jackson  Newcastle University John Vines  Northumbria University Janice McLaughlin  Newcastle University Peter Wright  Newcastle University,Recent HCI research has investigated how digital technologies might enable citizens to identify and express matters of civic concern. We extend this work by describing JourneyCam  a smartphone-based system that enables powered wheelchair users to capture video and sensor data about their experiences of mobility. Thirteen participants used JourneyCam to document journeys  after which the data they collected was used to support discussions around their experiences. Our findings highlight how the system facilitated the articulation of complex embodied experiences  and how the collected data might have particular value in surfacing these experiences to help inform urban design and policymaking. Participants valued the ways in which JourneyCam's moving image and sensor data made hard-to-express sensations apparent  as well as how it enabled them to surface previously unrecognised issues. We conclude by highlighting future opportunities for how such tools might enable citizens to inform and influence civic governance.
Crowdlicit: A System for Conducting Distributed End-User Elicitation and Identification Studies,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Gala,Abdullah X. Ali  University of Washington Meredith Ringel Morris  Microsoft Research Jacob O. Wobbrock  University of Washington,End-user elicitation studies are a popular design method. Currently  such studies are usually confined to a lab  limiting the number and diversity of participants  and therefore the representativeness of their results. Furthermore  the quality of the results from such studies generally lacks any formal means of evaluation. In this paper  we address some of the limitations of elicitation studies through the creation of the Crowdlicit system along with the introduction of end-user identification studies  which are the reverse of elicitation studies. Crowdlicit is a new web-based system that enables researchers to conduct online and in-lab elicitation and identification studies. We used Crowdlicit to run a crowd-powered elicitation study based on Morris's "Web on the Wall" study (2012) with 78 participants  arriving at a set of symbols that included six new symbols different from Morris's. We evaluated the effectiveness of 49 symbols (43 from Morris and six from Crowdlicit) by conducting a crowd-powered identification study. We show that the Crowdlicit elicitation study resulted in a set of symbols that was significantly more identifiable than Morris's.
Smart and Fermented Cities: An Approach to Placemaking in Urban Informatics,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Gala,Guo Freeman  Clemson University Jeffrey Bardzell  Indiana University Shaowen Bardzell  Indiana University Szu-Yu (Cyn) Liu  Indiana University Xi Lu  Indiana University Diandian Cao  Indiana University,What makes a city meaningful to its residents? What attracts people to live in a city and to care for it? Today  we might see such questions as concerns for HCI  given the emerging agendas of smart and connected cities  IoT  and ubiquitous computing: city residents' perceptions of and attitudes towards smart city technologies will play a role in technology acceptance. Theories of "placemaking" from humanist geography and urban planning address themselves to such concerns  and they have been taken up in HCI and urban informatics research. This theory offers ideas for developing community attachment  heightening the legibility of the city  and intensifying lived experiences in the city. We add to this body of research with an analysis of several initiatives of City Yeast  a community-based design collective in Taiwan that proposes the metaphor of fermentation as an approach to placemaking. We unpack how this approach shapes their design practice and link its implications to urban informatics research in HCI. We suggest that smart cities can also be pursued by leveraging the knowledge of city residents and helping to facilitate their participation in acts of perceiving  envisioning  and improving their local communities  including but not limited to smart and connected technologies.
A Promise Is A Promise: The Effect of Commitment Devices on Computer Security Intentions,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Alisa Frik  International Computer Science Institute & University of California  Berkeley Nathan Malkin  University of California  Berkeley Marian Harbach  International Computer Science Institute Eyal Peer  Hebrew University of Jerusalem Serge Egelman  International Computer Science Institute & University of California  Berkeley,Commitment devices are a technique from behavioral economics that have been shown to mitigate the effects of present bias---the tendency to discount future risks and gains in favor of immediate gratifications. In this paper  we explore the feasibility of using commitment devices to nudge users towards complying with varying online security mitigations. Using two online experiments  with over 1 000 participants total  we offered participants the option to be reminded or to schedule security tasks in the future. We find that both reminders and commitment nudges can increase users' intentions to install security updates and enable two-factor authentication  but not to configure automatic backups. Using qualitative data  we gain insights into the reasons for postponement and how to improve future nudges. We posit that current nudges may not live up to their full potential  as the timing options offered to users may be too rigid.
Bringing Design to the Privacy Table: Broadening,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Richmond Y. Wong  University of California  Berkeley Deirdre K. Mulligan  University of California  Berkeley,In calls for privacy by design (PBD)  regulators and privacy scholars have investigated the richness of the concept of "privacy." In contrast  "design" in HCI is comprised of rich and complex concepts and practices  but has received much less attention in the PBD context. Conducting a literature review of HCI publications discussing privacy and design  this paper articulates a set of dimensions along which design relates to privacy  including: the purpose of design  which actors do design work in these settings  and the envisioned beneficiaries of design work. We suggest new roles for HCI and design in PBD research and practice: utilizing values- and critically-oriented design approaches to foreground social values and help define privacy problem spaces. We argue such approaches  in addition to current "design to solve privacy problems" efforts  are essential to the full realization of PBD  while noting the politics involved when choosing design to address privacy.
Privacy  Power  and Invisible Labor on Amazon Mechanical Turk,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Shruti Sannon  Cornell University Dan Cosley  Cornell University,Tasks on crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk often request workers' personal information  raising privacy risks that may be exacerbated by requester-worker power dynamics. We interviewed 14 workers to understand how they navigate these risks. We found that Turkers' decisions to provide personal information during tasks were based on evaluations of the pay rate  the requester  the purpose  and the perceived sensitivity of the request. Participants also engaged in multiple privacy-protective behaviors  such as abandoning tasks or providing inaccurate data  though there were costs associated with these behaviors  such as wasted time and risk of rejection. Finally  their privacy concerns and practices evolved as they learned about both the platform and worker-designed tools and forums. These findings deepen our understanding of both privacy decision-making and invisible labor in paid crowdsourcing  and emphasize a general need to understand how privacy stances change over time.
On the Usability of HTTPS Deployment,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Matthew Bernhard  University of Michigan Jonathan Sharman  Rice University Claudia Ziegler Acemyan  Rice University Philip Kortum  Rice University Dan S. Wallach  Rice University J. Alex Halderman  University of Michigan,HTTPS and TLS are the backbone of Internet security  however setting up web servers to run these protocols is a notoriously difficult process. In this paper  we perform two live subjects usability studies on the deployment of HTTPS in a real-world setting. Study 1 is a within subjects comparison between traditional HTTPS configuration (purchasing a certificate and installing it on a server) and Let's Encrypt  which automates much of the process. Study 2 is a between subjects study looking at the same two systems  examining why users encounter usability issues. Overall we confirm past results that HTTPS is difficult to deploy  and we find some evidence that suggests Let's Encrypt is an easier  more efficient method for deploying HTTPS.
Effects of Local Latency on Game Pointing Devices and Game Pointing Tasks,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Michael Long  University of Saskatchewan Carl Gutwin  University of Saskatchewan,Studies have shown certain game tasks such as targeting to be negatively and significantly affected by latencies as low as 41ms. Therefore it is important to understand the relationship between local latency - delays between an input action and resulting change in the display - and common gaming tasks such as targeting and tracking. In addition  games now use a variety of input devices  including touchscreens  mice  tablets and controllers. These devices provide very different combinations of direct/indirect input  absolute/relative movement  and position/rate control  and are likely to be affected by latency in different ways. We performed a study evaluating and comparing the effects of latency across four devices (touchscreen  mouse  controller and drawing tablet) on targeting and interception tasks. We analyze both throughput and path characteristics  identify differences between devices  and provide design considerations for game designers.
Geometrically Compensating Effect of End-to-End Latency in Moving-Target Selection Games,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Injung Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Sunjun Kim  Aalto University Byungjoo Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Effects of unintended latency on gamer performance have been reported. End-to-end latency can be corrected by post-input manipulation of activation times  but this gives the player unnatural gameplay experience. For moving-target selection games such as Flappy Bird  the paper presents a predictive model of latency on error rate and a novel compensation method for the latency effects by adjusting the game's geometry design -- e.g.  by modifying the size of the selection region. Without manipulation of the game clock  this can keep the user's error rate constant even if the end-to-end latency of the system changes. The approach extends the current model of moving-target selection with two additional assumptions about the effects of latency: (1) latency reduces players' cue-viewing time and (2) pushes the mean of the input distribution backward. The model and method proposed have been validated through precise experiments.
Aggregated Visualization of Playtesting Data,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Günter Wallner  Eindhoven University of Technology Nour Halabi  University of Ontario Institute of Technology Pejman Mirza-Babaei  University of Ontario Institute of Technology,Playtesting is a key component in the game development process aimed at improving the quality of games through the collection of gameplay data and identification of design issues. Visualization techniques are currently being employed to help integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Despite that  two existing challenges are to determine the level of detail to be presented to developers based on their needs and to effectively communicate the collected data so that informed design changes can be reached. In this paper  we first propose an aggregated visualization technique that makes use of clustering  territory tessellation  and trajectory aggregation to simultaneously display mixed playtesting data. Secondly  to assess the usefulness of our technique we evaluate it through interviews with professional game developers and compare it to a non-aggregated visualization. The results of this study also provide an important contribution towards identifying areas of improvement in the portrayal of gameplay data.
Transforming Game Difficulty Curves using Function Composition,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Anurag Sarkar  Northeastern University Seth Cooper  Northeastern University,Player engagement within a game is often influenced by its difficulty curve: the pace at which in-game challenges become harder. Thus  finding an optimal difficulty curve is important. In this paper  we present a flexible and formal approach to transforming game difficulty curves by leveraging function composition. This allows us to describe changes to difficulty curves  such as making them "smoother"  in a more precise way. In an experiment with 400 players  we used function composition to modify the existing difficulty curve of the puzzle game Paradox to generate new curves. We found that transforming difficulty curves in this way impacted player engagement  including the number of levels completed and the estimated skill needed to complete those levels  as well as perceived competence. Further  we found some transformed curves dominated others with respect to engagement  indicating that different design goals can be traded-off by considering a subset of curves.

We aim to facilitate a broad-ranging  inclusive discussion of where queer HCI research goes next.
Communicating your Research to the Public and the Press,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Island B CROWNE,Helen Pilcher,Researchers are increasingly called upon to communicate with non-specialist audiences  but it can be difficult to communicate complex scientific topics in a way that makes them accessible and engaging to people outside the field. Further  interacting with the media can be daunting and frustrating and researchers frequently comment on how their work is misrepresented in the popular press. This course aims to give participants the skills needed to interact confidently with the media and to non-specialists  and get their key messages across.
The Promise of Empathy: Design  Disability  and Knowing the 'Other',Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Lomond,Cynthia L. Bennett  University of Washington Daniela K. Rosner  University of Washington,This paper examines the promise of empathy  the name commonly given to the initial phase of the human-centered design process in which designers seek to understand their intended users in order to inform technology development. By analyzing popular empathy activities aimed at understanding people with disabilities  we examine the ways empathy works to both powerfully and problematically align designers with the values of people who may use their products. Drawing on disability studies and feminist theorizing  we describe how acts of empathy building may further distance people with disabilities from the processes designers intend to draw them into. We end by reimagining empathy as guided by the lived experiences of people with disabilities who are traditionally positioned as those to be empathized.
Apprise: Supporting the Critical-Agency of Victims of Human Trafficking in Thailand,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Lomond,Hannah Thinyane  United Nations University  Institute on Computing & Society Karthik S. Bhat  United Nations University  Institute on Computing & Society,Human trafficking and forced labor are global issues affecting millions of people around the world. This paper describes an initiative that we are currently undertaking to understand the role technology can play to support the critical-agency of migrant workers in these situations of severe exploitation. Building on five consultations with more than 170 direct and indirect stakeholders in Thailand  the paper presents the co-design  development  and evaluation of Apprise  a mobile app to support the identification of victims of human trafficking using a Value Sensitive Design approach. It also provides a critical reflection on the use of digital technology in the initial screening of potential victims of human trafficking  to understand in what ways Apprise can support the critical agency of migrant workers in vulnerable situations.
Engaging Gentrification as a Social Justice Issue in HCI,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Lomond,Eric Corbett  Georgia Institute of Technology Yanni Loukissas  Georgia Institute of Technology,Gentrification—the spatial expression of economic inequality—is fundamentally a matter of social justice. Yet  even as work outside of HCI has begun to discuss how computing can enable or challenge gentrification  HCI's growing social justice agenda has not engaged with this issue. This omission creates an opportunity for HCI to develop a research and design agenda at the intersection of computing  social justice  and gentrification. We begin this work by outlining existing scholarship describing how the consumption side dynamics of gentrification are mediated by contemporary socio-technical systems. Subsequently  we build on the social justice framework introduced by Dombrowski  Harmon  and Fox to discuss how HCI may resist or counter such forces. We offer six modes of research that HCI scholars can pursue to engage gentrification.
Hackathons as Participatory Design: Iterating Feminist Utopias,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 16:00:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 17:20,Lomond,Alexis Hope  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Catherine D'Ignazio  Emerson College Josephine Hoy  University of Washington Rebecca Michelson  Independent Researcher Jennifer Roberts  Versed Education Group Kate Krontiris  Independent Researcher Ethan Zuckerman  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Breastfeeding is not only a public health issue  but also a matter of economic and social justice. This paper presents an iteration of a participatory design process to create spaces for re-imagining products  services  systems  and policies that support breastfeeding in the United States. Our work contributes to a growing literature around making hackathons more inclusive and accessible  designing participatory processes that center marginalized voices  and incorporating systems- and relationship-based approaches to problem solving. By presenting an honest assessment of the successes and shortcomings of the first iteration of a hackathon  we explain how we re-structured the second "Make the Breast Pump Not Suck" hackathon in service of equity and systems design. Key to our re-imagining of conventional innovation structures is a focus on experience design  where joy and play serve as key strategies to help people and institutions build relationships across lines of difference. We conclude with a discussion of design principles applicable not only to designers of events  but to social movement researchers and HCI scholars trying to address oppression through the design of technologies and socio-technical systems.
Feeling Fireworks: An Inclusive Tactile Firework Display,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Dorothea Reusser  Disney Research & ETH Zurich Espen Knoop  Disney Research Roland Siegwart  ETH Zurich Paul Beardsley  Disney Research,Fireworks are enjoyed throughout the world  but are primarily a visual experience. To make fireworks more inclusive for Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) persons  we have developed a large-scale interactive tactile display that produces tactile fireworks. Fast dynamic tactile effects are created at high spatial resolution  using directable nozzles that spray water jets onto the rear of a flexible screen. The screen furthermore has back-projected visual content and touch interaction. [object Object]
Slappyfications: Towards Ubiquitous Physical and Embodied Notifications,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Sebastian Günther  Technische Universität Darmstadt Florian Müller  Technische Universität Darmstadt Markus Funk  Technische Universität Darmstadt Max Mühlhäuser  Technische Universität Darmstadt,With emerging trends of notifying persons through ubiquitous technologies  such as ambient light  vibrotactile  or auditory cues  none of these technologies are truly ubiquitous and have proven to be easily missed or ignored. In this work  we propose Slappyfications  a novel way of sending unmissable embodied and ubiquitous notifications through a palm-based interface. Our prototype enables the users to send three types of Slappyfications: poke  slap  and the STEAM-HAMMER. Through a Wizard-of-Oz study  we show the applicability of our system in real-world scenarios. The results reveal a promising trend  as none of the participants missed a single Slappyfication.
Painting with CATS: Camera-Aided Texture Synthesis,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Ticha Sethapakdi  Carnegie Mellon University James McCann  Carnegie Mellon University,We present CATS  a digital painting system that synthesizes textures from live video in real-time  short-cutting the typical brush- and texture- gathering workflow. Through the use of boundary-aware texture synthesis  CATS produces strokes that are non-repeating and blend smoothly with each other. This allows CATS to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. We evaluated the effectiveness of CATS by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that CATS is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings.
Showcasing ElectroDermis,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Eric Markvicka  Carnegie Mellon University Guanyun Wang  Carnegie Mellon University Yi-Chin Lee  Carnegie Mellon University Gierad Laput  Carnegie Mellon University Carmel Majidi  Carnegie Mellon University Lining Yao  Carnegie Mellon University,In this video  we showcased "ElectroDermis"  a fabrication approach that simplifies the creation of highly-functional and stretchable wearable electronics that are conformal and fully untethered by discretizing rigid circuit boards into individual components. These individual components are wired together using stretchable electrical wiring and assembled on a spandex blend fabric  to provide high functionality in a robust form-factor that is reusable. We describe a series of example applications that illustrate the feasibility and utility of our system.
TrussFormer: 3D Printing Large Kinetic Structures,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Robert Kovacs  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Alexandra Ion  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Pedro Lopes  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Tim Oesterreich  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Johannes Filter  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Philipp Otto  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Tobias Arndt  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Nico Ring  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Melvin Witte  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Anton Synytsia  Oregon State University Patrick Baudisch  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam,TrussFormer is an integrated end-to-end system that allows users to 3D print large-scale kinetic structures  i.e.  structures that involve motion and deal with inertial forces. TrussFormer builds on TrussFab  from which it inherits the ability to create static large-scale truss structures from 3D printed connectors and PET bottles. TrussFormer adds movement to these structures by placing linear actuators into them: either manually  wrapped in reusable components called assets  or by demonstrating the intended movement. TrussFormer verifies that the resulting structure is mechanically sound and will withstand the dynamic forces resulting from the motion. To fabricate the design  TrussFormer generates the underlying hinge system that can be printed on standard desktop 3D printers. We demonstrate TrussFormer with several example objects  including a 6 legged walking robot and a 4m tall animatronics dinosaur with 5 degrees of freedom.
Gamified Ads: Bridging the Gap Between User Enjoyment and the Effectiveness of Online Ads,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Vladislav Hnatovskiy  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Maximilian Altmeyer  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Pascal Lessel  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Kathrin Dernbecher  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Marc Schubhan  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Antonio Krüger  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus,Often  online ads are disruptive and annoying. As a consequence  ad blockers are used to prevent ads from appearing on a website. However  web service providers lose more than 35 billion dollars per year because of this development. As an alternative  we investigate the user enjoyment and the advertising effectiveness of playfully deactivating online ads. This video showcase illustrates the research method and the most interesting results of our previous research. Here  we assessed the perception of eight game concepts allowing users to playfully deactivate ads and implemented three well-perceived ones. These were found to be more enjoyable than deactivating ads without game elements  with one game concept being even preferred over using an ad blocker. We also found positive effects on ad effectiveness as compared to the baseline.
Deep Reality: Towards Increasing Relaxation in VR by Subtly Changing Light  Sound and Movement Based on HR  EDA  and EEG,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Judith Amores  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Anna Fuste  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Robert Richer  Friedrich- Alexander-Universitat,We present an interactive Virtual Reality (VR) experience that uses biometric information for reflection and relaxation. We monitor in real-time brain activity using a modified version of the Muse EEG and track heart rate (HR) and electro dermal activity (EDA) using an Empatica E4 wristband. We use this data to procedurally generate 3D creatures and change the lighting of the environment to reflect the internal state of the viewer in a set of visuals depicting an underwater audiovisual composition. These 3D creatures are created to unconsciously influence the body signals of the observer via subtle pulses of light  movement and sound. We aim to decrease heart rate and respiration by subtle  almost imperceptible light flickering  sound pulsations and slow movements of these creatures to increase relaxation.
Digital Fabrication of Soft Actuated Objects by Machine Knitting,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Lea Albaugh  Carnegie Mellon University Scott Hudson  Carnegie Mellon University Lining Yao  Carnegie Mellon University,With recent interest in shape-changing interfaces  material-driven design  wearable technologies  and soft robotics  digital fabrication of soft actuatable material is increasingly in demand. Much of this research focuses on elastomers or non-stretchy air bladders. Computationally-controlled machine knitting offers an alternative fabrication technology which can rapidly produce soft textile objects that have a very different character: breathable  lightweight  and pleasant to the touch. These machines are well established and optimized for the mass production of garments  but have received much less attention as general purpose fabrication device compared to other digital fabrication techniques such as CNC machining or 3D printing. In this work  we explore a series of design strategies for machine knitting actuated soft objects by integrating tendons with shaping and anisotropic texture design.
Cyborg Botany: Augmented Plants as Sensors  Displays and Actuators,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Harpreet Sareen  Parsons School of Design & Massachusetts Institute of Technology Jiefu Zheng  Parsons School of Design Pattie Maes  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,The nature has myriad plant organisms  many of them carrying unique sensing and expression abilities. Plants can sense the environment  other living entities and regenerate  actuate or grow in response. Our interaction mechanisms and communication channels with such organisms in nature are subtle  unlike our interaction with digital devices. We propose a new convergent view of interaction design in nature by merging and powering our electronic functionalities with existing biological functions of plants. Cyborg Botany is a design exploration of deep technological integration within plants. Each desired synthetic function is grown  injected or carefully placed in conjunction with a plant's natural functions. With a nanowire grown inside the xylem of a plant  we demonstrate its use as a touch sensor  motion sensor  antenna and more. We also demonstrate a software through which a user clicks on a plant's leaves to individual control their movement  and explore the use of plants as a display. Our goal is to make use of a plant's own sensing and expressive abilities of nature for our interaction devices. Merging synthetic circuitry with plant's own physiology could pave a way to make these lifeforms responsive to our interactions and their ubiquitous sustainable deployment.
Connected Resources - Empowering Older People to Age Resourcefully,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Masako Kitazaki  Delft University of Technology Iohanna Nicenboim  Delft University of Technology Elisa Giaccardi  Delft University of Technology,With this video  we showcase the possibilities of the Internet of Things and machine learning to support improvisation in older people. Available smart products for older people tend to be developed with narrowly predefined use-scenarios  based on stereotypes of elderly as passive  immobile  and technologically incompetent. This type of products may restrict older people's existing capabilities of resourcefulness and autonomy [1]. As an alternative approach  we created Connected Resources  a family of combinable sensors and actuators for older people that encourages them to negotiate and situate use according to their personal and changing circumstances with a high level of freedom. The objects learn older people's unique ways of using these artifacts and share them through an online platform to encourage the development of new strategies. In this way  Connected Resources celebrate older people's creativity  instead of providing normative solutions or enforcing compliance with certain behavior.
AttentivU: A Biofeedback System for Real-time Monitoring and Improvement of Engagement,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Nataliya Kosmyna  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Caitlin Morris  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Utkarsh Sarawgi  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Pattie Maes  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,It is increasingly hard for adults and children alike to be attentive given the increasing amounts of information and distractions surrounding us. We have developed AttentivU: a device  in a socially acceptable form factor of a pair of glasses  that a person can put on in moments when he/she wants/needs to be attentive. The AttentivU glasses use electroencephalography (EEG) as well as Electrooculography (EOG) sensors to measure attention of a person in real-time and provide either audio or haptic feedback to the user when their attention is low  thereby nudging them to become engaged again. We have tested this device in workplace and classroom settings with over 80 subjects. We have performed experiments with people studying or working by themselves  viewing online lectures as well as listening to classroom lectures. The obtained results show that our device makes a person more attentive and produces improved learning and work performance outcomes.
4D Printing A-line,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Guanyun Wang  Carnegie Mellon University Ye Tao  Carnegie Mellon University & Zhejiang Univeristy Ozguc Bertug Capunaman  Carnegie Mellon University Humphrey Yang  Carnegie Mellon University Lining Yao  Carnegie Mellon University,In this video  we showcased "A-line"  a 4D printing system for designing and fabricating morphing three-dimensional shapes out of simple linear elements. A-line integrates a method of bending angle control in up to eight directions for one printed line segment  using a single type of thermoplastic material. A software platform to support the design  simulation and tool path generation is developed to support the design and manufacturing of various A-line structures. The video showcases the design space of A-line  including the unique properties of line sculpting  the suitability for compliant mechanisms and the ability to travel through narrow spaces and self-deploy or self-lock on site.
Hyper Sensorial -- Human Computed Neurodivergent Poem,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Luca M. Damiani  London College of Communication & University of the Arts London,In this video artwork  the author looks at the interaction between neurodiversity and media design  focusing on his acoustic condition of hyperacusis as well as his neurodivergent condition of Asperger's. There are many inner thoughts that the hyper sensorial acoustic disorder brings  and the author creates poems as an output  interrelating art and technology in the cognitive process  and underlining a cross-connection between the data and emotions.
Creating Worlds: Exploring Animated Videos as a Tool for Contextualization in User Research,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Tommy Nilsson  University of Nottingham Andy Crabtree  University of Nottingham Joel Fischer  University of Nottingham Boriana Koleva  University of Nottingham,Research indicates that personal adoption of emerging ubicomp technologies is being notoriously hampered by a variety of critical issues including trust  privacy and security. Issues such as these cannot be studied and understood by evaluating computer systems in isolation  but rather by taking a 'big picture' approach and examining their synergy with the broader social context. Traditional low-fidelity prototyping methods  such as interface mockups  are however poorly equipped to convey such broader settings. Video-based scenarios on the other hand are uniquely qualified to portray rich socio-technical ecosystems. By creating a set of provocative video scenarios that contextualize and provide a backdrop for prospective technologies  we thus seek to draw attention to the potentially important role that worldbuilding strategies might play in the future of low fidelity prototyping.
ComunicArte: A Public Speaking Trainer in Virtual Reality,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Meriem El-Yamri  Complutense University of Madrid Alejandro Romero-Hernandez  Complutense University of Madrid Manuel Gonzalez-Riojo  Complutense University of Madrid Borja Manero  Complutense University of Madrid,Project ComunicArte is a virtual reality videogame for training the ability of public speaking. It is built as an environment where the speaker confronts a virtual audience that reacts in real time to the speaker's features  such as voice  gestures and bio-metric parameters (heart rate or skin conductivity  among others). The novelty of this videogame is that it is focused on the audience  since in real life  the only feedback we receive when we speak in public is that of our listeners. By their reactions we can determine if our communication is being effective. For that purpose  we included in the game a virtual audience based on agents that is able to provide feedback to the speakers in real time  so that they can react and adapt their speech accordingly.
Plunder Planet: An Adaptive Fitness Game Setup for Children,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Anna Lisa Martin-Niedecken  Zurich University of the Arts,Childhood obesity is one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century  although it could easily be prevented by regular physical activity. Exergames have been applauded for their potential to counteract this tendency in a playful and motivating manner. However  current solutions often lack a user-centered  interdisciplinary design approach covering the physical and virtual design levels. Consequently  motivational factors  attractiveness and effectiveness of these fitness games remain limited. To contribute to this topic  we – a team of sports scientist and game designers – developed the adaptive exergame Plunder Planet (Fig. 1) with and for children and young adolescents [1]. It can be played as single or cooperative multiplayer [2] with two different motion-based controllers that require either haptic or gesture-based input movements (Fig. 2) and trigger different (social) gameplay experiences. Based on the player's heart rate and in-game performance the game difficulty and complexity are continuously adjusted to provide a maximum attractive and effective experience.
Mobeybou - A Digital Manipulative for Multicultural Narrative Creation,Wednesday  May 08  2019 - 17:30:00,Wednesday  May 08  2019 18:10,Lomond,Cristina Sylla  University of Minho Vítor Martins  University of Minho  Portugal Gabriela Sá  University of Minho  Portugal Ana Paula Caruso  Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave Bruno Amaro  University of Minho Douglas Menegazzi  Federal University of Santa Catarina Francisco Sylla  University of Minho,Mobeybou  is a digital manipulative (DM) that uses physical blocks to interact with digital content. It intends to create an environment for promoting the development of language and narrative competences as well as digital literacy among pre and primary school children. It offers a variety of characters  objects and landscapes from various cultures around the world and can be used for creating multicultural narratives. An interactive app developed for each country provides additional cultural and geographical information about each represented culture.

An Evaluation of Radar Metaphors for Providing Directional Stimuli Using Non-Verbal Sound,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Brendan Cassidy  University of Central Lancashire Janet C. Read  University of Central Lancashire I. Scott MacKenzie  York University,We compared four audio-based radar metaphors for providing directional stimuli to users of AR headsets. The metaphors are clock face  compass  white noise  and scale. Each metaphor  or method  signals the movement of a virtual arm in a radar sweep. In a user study  statistically significant differences were observed for accuracy and response time. Beat-based methods (clock face  compass) elicited responses biased to the left of the stimulus location  and non-beat-based methods (white noise  scale) produced responses biased to the right of the stimulus location. The beat methods were more accurate than the non-beat methods. However  the non-beat methods elicited quicker responses. We also discuss how response accuracy varies along the radar sweep between methods. These observations contribute design insights for non-verbal  non-visual directional prompting.
A Comparison of Notification Techniques for Out-of-View Objects in Full-Coverage Displays,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Julian Petford  University of St Andrews Iain Carson  University of St Andrews Miguel A. Nacenta  University of St Andrews Carl Gutwin  University of Saskatchewan,Full-coverage displays can place visual content anywhere on the interior surfaces of a room (e.g.  a weather display near the coat stand). In these settings  digital artefacts can be located behind the user and out of their field of view - meaning that it can be difficult to notify the user when these artefacts need attention. Although much research has been carried out on notification  little is known about how best to direct people to the necessary location in room environments. We designed five diverse attention-guiding techniques for full-coverage display rooms  and evaluated them in a study where participants completed search tasks guided by the different techniques. Our study provides new results about notification in full-coverage displays: we showed benefits of persistent visualisations that could be followed all the way to the target and that indicate distance-to-target. Our findings provide useful information for improving the usability of interactive full-coverage environments.
Hey Google  Can I Ask You Something in Private?,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Eugene Cho  Pennsylvania State University,MModern day voice-activated virtual assistants allow users to share and ask for information that could be considered as personal through different input modalities and devices. Using Google Assistant  this study examined if the differences in modality (i.e.  voice vs. text) and device (i.e.  smartphone vs. smart home device) affect user perceptions when users attempt to retrieve sensitive health information from voice assistants. Major findings from this study suggest that voice (vs. text) interaction significantly enhanced perceived social presence of the voice assistant  but only when the users solicited less sensitive health-related information. Furthermore  when individuals reported less privacy concerns  voice (vs. text) interaction elicited positive attitudes toward the voice assistant via increased social presence  but only in the low (vs. high) information sensitivity condition. Contrary to modality  the device difference did not exert any significant impact on the attitudes toward the voice assistant regardless of the sensitivity level of the health information being asked or the level of individuals' privacy concerns.
Detecting Perception of Smartphone Notifications Using Skin Conductance Responses,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Alsh 1,Pascal E. Fortin  McGill University Elisabeth Sulmont  McGill University Jeremy Cooperstock  McGill University,Today's smartphone notification systems are incapable of determining whether a notification has been successfully perceived without explicit interaction from the user. If the system incorrectly assumes that a notification has not been perceived  it may repeat it redundantly  disrupting the user and others (e.g.  phone ringing). Or  if it incorrectly assumes that a notification was perceived  and therefore fails to repeat it  the notification will be missed altogether (e.g.  text message). Results from a laboratory study confirm  for the first time  that both vibrotactile and auditory smartphone notifications induce skin conductance responses (SCR)  that the induced responses differ from that of arbitrary stimuli  and that they could be employed to predict perception of smartphone notifications after their presentation using wearable sensors.
Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration Combining 360 Video and 3D Reconstruction,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Theophilus Teo  University of South Australia Louise Lawrence  University of South Australia Gun A. Lee  University of South Australia Mark Billinghurst  University of South Australia Matt Adcock  CSIRO,Remote Collaboration using Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) has recently become a popular way for people from different places to work together. Local workers can collaborate with remote helpers by sharing 360-degree live video or 3D virtual reconstruction of their surroundings. However  each of these techniques has benefits and drawbacks. In this paper we explore mixing 360 video and 3D reconstruction together for remote collaboration  by preserving benefits of both systems while reducing drawbacks of each. We developed a hybrid prototype and conducted user study to compare benefits and problems of using 360 or 3D alone to clarify the needs for mixing the two  and also to evaluate the prototype system. We found participants performed significantly better on collaborative search tasks in 360 and felt higher social presence  yet 3D also showed potential to complement. Participant feedback collected after trying our hybrid system provided directions for improvement.
Can Mobile Augmented Reality Stimulate a Honeypot Effect? Observations from Santa's Lil Helper,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Ryan M. Kelly  The University of Melbourne Hasan Shahid Ferdous  The University of Melbourne Niels Wouters  The University of Melbourne Frank Vetere  The University of Melbourne,In HCI  the honeypot effect describes a form of audience engagement in which a person's interaction with a technology stimulates passers-by to observe  approach and engage in an interaction themselves. In this paper we explore the potential for honeypot effects to arise in the use of mobile augmented reality (AR) applications in urban spaces. We present an observational study of Santa's Lil Helper  a mobile AR game that created a Christmas-themed treasure hunt in a metropolitan area. Our study supports a consideration of three factors that may impede the honeypot effect: the presence of people in relation to the game and its interactive components; the visibility of gameplay in urban space; and the extent to which the game permits a shared experience. We consider how these factors can inform the design of future AR experiences that are capable of stimulating honeypot effects in public space.
Eye-Write: Gaze Sharing for Collaborative Writing,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Grete Helena Kütt  Pomona College Kevin Lee  Pomona College Ethan Hardacre  Pomona College Alexandra Papoutsaki  Pomona College,Online collaborative writing is an increasingly common practice. Despite its positive effect on productivity and quality of work  it poses challenges to co-authors in remote settings because of limitations in conversational grounding and activity awareness. This paper presents Eye-Write  a novel system which allows two co-authors to see at will the location of their partner's gaze within a text editor. To investigate the effect of shared gaze on collaboration  we conducted a study on synchronous remote collaborative writing in academic settings with 20 dyads. Gaze sharing improved five aspects of perceived collaboration quality: mutual understanding  level of joint attention  flow of communication  level of negotiation  and awareness of the co-author's activity. Furthermore  dyads whose participants deactivated the gaze visualization showed a smaller degree of collaboration. Our findings offer insights for future text editors by outlining the benefits of at-will gaze sharing in collaborative writing.
Usability of Gamified Knowledge Learning in VR and Desktop-3D,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Alsh 2,Sebastian Oberdörfer  University of Würzburg David Heidrich  University of Würzburg Marc Erich Latoschik  University of Würzburg,Affine Transformations (ATs) often escape an intuitive approach due to their high complexity. Therefore  we developed GEtiT that directly encodes ATs in its game mechanics and scales the knowledge's level of abstraction. This results in an intuitive application as well as audiovisual presentation of ATs and hence in a knowledge learning. We also developed a specific Virtual Reality (VR) version to explore the effects of immersive VR on the learning outcomes. This paper presents our approach of directly encoding abstract knowledge in game mechanics  the conceptual design of GEtiT and its technical implementation. Both versions are compared in regard to their usability in a user study. The results show that both GEtiT versions induce a high degree of flow and elicit a good intuitive use. They validate the effectiveness of the design and the resulting knowledge application requirements. Participants favored GEtiT VR thus showing a potentially higher learning quality when using VR.
HCI and Menopause: Designing With and Around the Aging Body,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Agatha Tutia  University of Washington Kelda Baljon  University of Washington Lan Vu  University of Washington Daniela K. Rosner  University of Washington,With growing concern for the intimate dimensions of technology development  HCI scholars have begun to grapple with who wields power in design around the body. However  beyond menstruation  few studies have sought to examine the role of technology design in the later stages of life for menstruating people. This paper considers menopause as a central  but overlooked life phase informing the design of future intimate technologies. We review empirical analysis of menopausal experiences and design provocations that emerged from our work. We end with a reflection on the opportunities and pitfalls around menopause design.
ROOT: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Urban Health Challenges with HCI,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Ida Damen  Eindhoven University of Technology Rens Brankaert  University of Technology Eindhoven Mengru Xue  Eindhoven University of Technology Xiaoyue Chen  Eindhoven University of Technology Anne Grave  Eindhoven University of Technology Steven Vos  Eindhoven University of Technology,With the rise of chronic diseases as the number one cause of death and disability among urban populations  it has become increasingly important to design for healthy environments. There is  however  a lack of interdisciplinary approaches and solutions to improve health and well-being through urban planning and design. This case study offers an HCI solution and approach to design for healthy urban structures and dynamics in existing neighborhoods. We discuss the design process and design of ROOT  an interactive lighting system that aims to stimulate walking and running through supportive  collaborative and social interaction. We exemplify how multidisciplinary HCI approaches in a hackathon setting can contribute to real life urban health challenges. This case study concludes that the experimental and collaborative nature of a hackathon facilitates the rapid exchange of perspectives and fosters interdisciplinary research and practice in urban planning and design.
Social Media as a Passive Sensor in Longitudinal Studies of Human Behavior and Wellbeing,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Koustuv Saha  Georgia Institute of Technology Ayse E.

Mattingly  University of Notre Dame Edward Moskal  Notre Dame Anusha Sirigiri  Dartmouth College Aaron Striegel  University of Notre Dame Dong Whi Yoo  Georgia Institute of Technology,Social media serves as a platform to share thoughts and connect with others. The ubiquitous use of social media also enables researchers to study human behavior as the data can be collected in an inexpensive and unobtrusive way. Not only does social media provide a passive means to collect historical data at scale  it also functions as a ''verbal'' sensor  providing rich signals about an individual's social ecological context. This case study introduces an infrastructural framework to illustrate the feasibility of passively collecting social media data at scale in the context of an ongoing multimodal sensing study of workplace performance (N=757). We study our dataset in its relationship with demographic  personality  and wellbeing attributes of individuals. Importantly  as a means to study selection bias  we examine what characterizes individuals who choose to consent to social media data sharing vs. those who do not. Our work provides practical experiences and implications for research in the HCI field who seek to conduct similar longitudinal studies that harness the potential of social media data.
Multimodal Speech-based Dialogue for the Mini-Mental State Examination,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Alexander Prange  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH) Mira Niemann  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH) Antje Latendorf  Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin Anika Steinert  Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin Daniel Sonntag  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI),We present a system-initiative multimodal speech-based dialogue system for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MMSE is a questionnaire-based cognitive test  which is traditionally administered by a trained expert using pen and paper and afterwards scored manually to measure cognitive impairment. By using a digital pen and speech dialogue  we implement a multimodal system for the automatic execution and evaluation of the MMSE. User input is evaluated and scored in real-time. We present a user experience study with 15 participants and compare the usability of the proposed system with the traditional approach. Our experiment suggests that both modes perform equally well in terms of usability  but the proposed system has higher novelty ratings. We compare assessment scorings produced by our system with manual scorings made by domain experts.
Design for User Interaction with Intelligent Systems,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Martin Maguire  Loughborough University,Intelligence is now a widely accepted part of systems that we interact with every day  but comes in many forms as far as the user is concerned. There is a need for interaction designers to have an understanding of the nature of intelligent systems and be able to categorise different types of intelligence as it appears to the user. This course will give attendees an appreciation of what 'intelligence' or 'smartness' within computer systems is  discuss how it is currently perceived  and describe the enablers and barriers to its effective use. The course will categorise different kinds of intelligence capability. It will offer interaction design guidelines or heuristics for the design of user interfaces with intelligent features to enable them to be more effective as partners with humans. It will use a mixture of teaching techniques combining presentation  discussion and class exercise.
Eye Tracking Methodology in Screen-based Usability Testing,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Argyll 3 CROWNE,Lin Wang  U.S. Census Bureau,Eye tracking is an important tool in usability testing of a screen-based user interface. Though eye tracking has been used in usability testing for quite a while  challenges remain. For example  how to accurately calibrate gaze point? How to interpret a scan pattern? In this tutorial  we will introduce the basics of the human oculomotor system  the role of eye tracking in cognition  eye tracking recording techniques  and data analysis methods. Upon the completion of this tutorial  students will have a basic understanding of physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying eye tracking  data collection techniques  and data analysis methods.
Bring the Outside In: Providing Accessible Experiences Through VR for People with Dementia in Locked Psychiatric Hospitals,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Luma Tabbaa  University of Kent Chee Siang Ang  University of Kent Vienna Rose  St. Andrew's Healthcare Panote Siriaraya  Kyoto Sangyo University Inga Stewart  St Andrew's Healthcare Keith G. Jenkins  St Andrew's Healthcare Maria Matsangidou  University of Kent,Many people with dementia (PWD) residing in long-term care may face barriers in accessing experiences beyond their physical premises; this may be due to location  mobility constraints  legal mental health act restrictions  or offence-related restrictions. In recent years  there have been research interests towards designing non-pharmacological interventions aiming to improve the Quality of Life (QoL) for PWD within long-term care. We explored the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as a tool to provide 360°-video based experiences for individuals with moderate to severe dementia residing in a locked psychiatric hospital. We discuss at depth the appeal of using VR for PWD  and the observed impact of such interaction. We also present the design opportunities  pitfalls  and recommendations for future deployment in healthcare services. This paper demonstrates the potential of VR as a virtual alternative to experiences that may be difficult to reach for PWD residing within locked setting.
Making Healthcare Infrastructure Work: Unpacking the Infrastructuring Work of Individuals,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Xinning Gui  University of California  Irvine Yunan Chen  University of California  Irvine,The U.S. healthcare infrastructure is fragmented with various breakdowns. Patients or caregivers have to rely on their own to overcome barriers and fix breakdowns in order to obtain necessary service  that is  infrastructuring work to make the healthcare infrastructure work for them. So far little attention has been paid to such infrastructuring work in healthcare. We present an interview study of 32 U.S. parents of young children to discuss the work of infrastructuring our participants carry out to deal with breakdowns within the healthcare infrastructure. We report how they repaired unexpected failures happening at the individual level  aligned components at organizational and cross-organizational level  and circumvented infrastructural constraints (e.g.  policy and financial ones) that were perceived as ambiguous and demanding. We discuss infrastructuring work in light of the literature on patients' and caregivers' work  reflect upon the notion of patient engagement  and explore nuances along several dimensions of infrastructuring work.
Beyond the Patient Portal: Supporting Needs of Hospitalized Patients,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Shefali Haldar  University of Washington Sonali R. Mishra  University of Washington Maher Khelifi  University of Washington Ari H. Pollack  Seattle Children's Hospital & University of Washington Wanda Pratt  University of Washington,Although patient portals—technologies that give patients access to their health information—are recognized as key to increasing patient engagement  we have a limited un- derstanding of how these technologies should be designed to meet the needs of hospitalized patients and caregivers. Through semi-structured interviews with 30 patients and caregivers  we examine how future patient portals can best align with their needs and support engagement in their care. Our findings reveal six needs that existing patient portals do not support: (1) transitioning from home to hospital  (2) adjusting schedules and receiving status updates  (3) under- standing and remembering care  (4) asking questions and flagging problems  (5) collaborating with providers and care- givers  and (6) preparing for discharge and at-home care. Based on these findings  we discuss three design implica- tions: highlight patient-centric goals and preferences  pro- vide dynamic information about care events  and design for situationally-impaired users. Our contributions guide future patient portals in engaging hospitalized patients and care- givers as primary stakeholders in their health care.
Unremarkable AI: Fitting Intelligent Decision Support into Critical  Clinical Decision-Making Processes,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Boisdale 2,Qian Yang  Carnegie Mellon University Aaron Steinfeld  Carnegie Mellon University John Zimmerman  Carnegie Mellon University,Clinical decision support tools (DST) promise improved healthcare outcomes by offering data-driven insights. While effective in lab settings  almost all DSTs have failed in practice. Empirical research diagnosed poor contextual fit as the cause. This paper describes the design and field evaluation of a radically new form of DST. It automatically generates slides for clinicians' decision meetings with subtly embedded machine prognostics. This design took inspiration from the notion of Unremarkable Computing  that by augmenting the users' routines technology/AI can have significant importance for the users yet remain unobtrusive. Our field evaluation suggests clinicians are more likely to encounter and embrace such a DST. Drawing on their responses  we discuss the importance and intricacies of finding the right level of unremarkableness in DST design  and share lessons learned in prototyping critical AI systems as a situated experience.
Understanding and Mitigating Worker Biases in the Crowdsourced Collection of Subjective Judgments,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Christoph Hube  Leibniz Universtät Hannover Besnik Fetahu  Leibniz Universtät Hannover Ujwal Gadiraju  Leibniz Universtät Hannover,Crowdsourced data acquired from tasks that comprise a subjective component (e.g. opinion detection  sentiment analysis) is potentially affected by the inherent bias of crowd workers who contribute to the tasks. This can lead to biased and noisy ground-truth data  propagating the undesirable bias and noise when used in turn to train machine learning models or evaluate systems. In this work  we aim to understand the influence of workers' own opinions on their performance in the subjective task of bias detection. We analyze the influence of workers' opinions on their annotations corresponding to different topics. Our findings reveal that workers with strong opinions tend to produce biased annotations. We show that such bias can be mitigated to improve the overall quality of the data collected. Experienced crowd workers also fail to distance themselves from their own opinions to provide unbiased annotations.
Volunteer Moderators in Twitch Micro Communities: How They Get Involved  the Roles They Play  and the Emotional Labor They Experience,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Donghee Yvette Wohn  New Jersey Institute of Technology,The ability to engage in real-time text conversations is an important feature on live streaming platforms. The moderation of this text content relies heavily on the work of unpaid volunteers. This study reports on interviews with 20 people who moderate for Twitch micro communities  defined as channels that are built around a single or group of streamers  rather than the broadcast of an event. The study identifies how people become moderators  their different styles of moderating  and the difficulties that come with the job. In addition to the hardships of dealing with negative content  moderators also have complex interpersonal relationships with the streamers and viewers  where the boundaries between emotional labor  physical labor  and fun are intertwined.
"Can you believe [1:21]?!": Content and Time-Based Reference Patterns in Video Comments,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Matin Yarmand  University of British Columbia Dongwook Yoon  University of British Columbia Samuel Dodson  University of British Columbia Ido Roll  University of British Columbia Sidney S. Fels  University of British Columbia,As videos become increasingly ubiquitous  so is video-based commenting. To contextualize comments  people often reference specific audio/visual content within video. However  the literature falls short of explaining the types of video content people refer to  how they establish references and identify referents  how video characteristics (e.g.  genre) impact referencing behaviors  and how references impact social engagement. We present a taxonomy for classifying video references by referent type and temporal specificity. Using our taxonomy  we analyzed 2.5K references with quotations and timestamps collected from public YouTube comments. We found: 1) people reference intervals of video more frequently than time-points  2) visual entities are referenced more often than sounds  and 3) comments with quotes are more likely to receive replies but not more "likes". We discuss the need for in-situ dereferencing user interfaces  illustrate design concepts for typed referencing features  and provide a dataset for future studies.
Does Who Matter? Studying the Impact of Relationship Characteristics on Receptivity to Mobile IM Messages,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Carron 1,Hao-Ping Lee  National Chiao Tung University Kuan-Yin Chen  National Chiao Tung University Chih-Heng Lin  National Chiao Tung University Chia-Yu Chen  National Chengchi University Yu-Lin Chung  National Tsing Hua University Yung-Ju Chang  National Chiao Tung University Chien-Ru Sun  National Chengchi University,This study examines the characteristics of mobile instant-messaging users' relationships with their social contacts and the effects of both relationship and interruption context on four measures of receptivity: Attentiveness  Responsiveness  Interruptibility  and Opportuneness. Overall  interruption context overshadows relationship characteristics as predictors of all four of these facets of receptivity; this overshadowing was most acute for Interruptibility and Opportuneness  but existed for all factors. In addition  while Mobile Maintenance Expectation and Activity Engagement were negatively correlated with all receptivity measures  each such measure had its own set of predictors  highlighting the conceptual differences among the measures. Finally  delving more deeply into potential relationship effects  we found that a single  simple closeness question was as effective at predicting receptivity as the 12-item Unidimensional Relationship Closeness Scale.
Dissent by Design: A Manifesto for CHI Manifestos,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Carron 2,Julian Hanna  Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute Simone Ashby  University of Madeira & Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute Sónia Matos  Edinburgh College of Art & Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute Alexis Faria  University of Madeira & Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute Ricardo Rodrigues  Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute,The past decade has seen a welcome rise in critical reflection in HCI [29 13 3 19 20 21]. But the use of manifestos - not to promote but to provoke - is still rare in comparison to more established disciplines. Digital activism has given new life to the manifesto  and the manifesto may in turn give new life to CHI - prompting new ideas by temporarily liberating scholars from the confines of careful speech and rational argument. We present a manifesto for manifestos; a chance for the CHI community to question its status quo and dream of its possible futures using our purpose-built authoring tools.
User Experience (UX) Research in Games,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,Lennart E. Nacke  University of Waterloo Pejman Mirza-Babaei  University of Ontario Institute of Technology Anders Drachen  University of York,This course will allow participants to understand the complexities of games user research methods for user experience research in games. For this  we have put together three-course sessions at CHI (80 minutes each) on applications of different user research methods in games evaluation and playtesting exercises to help participants turn player feedback into actionable design recommendations. This course consists of three interactive face-to-face units during CHI 2019.
Conversation Design: Principles  Strategies  and Practical Application,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Margaret Urban  Google  LLC Stephen Mailey  Google UK  Ltd.,With the rise of digital assistants  chatbots  and other conversational interfaces  there's a huge demand for detail and instruction for Conversation Design.

Designing Second-Screening Experiences for Social Co-Selection and Critical Co-Viewing of Reality TV,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Tom Feltwell  Northumbria University Gavin Wood  Northumbria University Scarlett Rowland  Northumbria University Kiel S. Long  Northumbria University Chris Elsden  Northumbria University Phillip Brooker  University of Liverpool John Vines  Northumbria University Pamela Briggs  Northumbria University Julie Barnett  University of Bath Shaun Lawson  Northumbria University,Public commentary related to reality TV can be overwhelmed by thoughtless reactions and negative sentiments  which often problematically reinforce the cultural stereotyping typically employed in such media. We describe the design  and month-long evaluation  of a mobile "second-screening" application  Screenr  which uses co-voting and live textual tagging to encourage more critical co-viewing in these contexts. Our findings highlight how Screenr supported interrogation of the production qualities and claims of shows  promoted critical discourse around the motivations of programmes  and engaged participants in reflecting on their own assumptions and views. We situate our results within the context of existing second-screening co-viewing work  discuss implications for such technologies to support critical engagement with socio-political media  and provide design implications for future digital technologies in this domain.
App Usage Predicts Cognitive Ability in Older Adults,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Mitchell L. Gordon  Stanford University Leon Gatys  Apple Inc. Carlos Guestrin  Apple Inc. Jeffrey P. Bigham  Apple Inc. Andrew Trister  Apple Inc. Kayur Patel  Apple Inc.,We have limited understanding of how older adults use smartphones  how their usage differs from younger users  and the causes for those differences. As a result  researchers and developers may miss promising opportunities to support older adults or offer solutions to unimportant problems. To characterize smartphone usage among older adults  we collected iPhone usage data from 84 healthy older adults over three months. We find that older adults use fewer apps  take longer to complete tasks  and send fewer messages. We use cognitive test results from these same older adults to then show that up to 79% of these differences can be explained by cognitive decline  and that we can predict cognitive test performance from smartphone usage with 83% ROCAUC. While older adults differ from younger adults in app usage behavior  the "cognitively young" older adults use smartphones much like their younger counterparts. Our study suggests that to better support all older adults  researchers and developers should consider the full spectrum of cognitive function.
Talking about Chat at Work in the Global South: An Ethnographic Study of Chat Use in India and Kenya,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Moira McGregor  Stockholm University Nicola J. Bidwell  International University of Management Vidya Sarangapani  Newcastle University Jonathan Appavoo  Boston University Jacki O'Neill  Microsoft Research India,In this paper  we examine how two chat apps fit into the communication ecosystem of six large distributed enterprises  in India and Kenya. From the perspective of management  these chat apps promised to foster greater communication and awareness between workers in the field  and between fieldworkers and the enterprises administration and management centres. Each organisation had multiple different types of chat groups  characterised by the types of content and interaction patterns they mediate  and the different organisational functions they fulfil. Examining the interplay between chat and existing local practices for coordination  collaboration and knowledge-sharing  we discuss how chat manifests in the distributed workplace and how it fits -- or otherwise -- alongside the rhythms of both local and remote work. We contribute to understandings of chat apps for workplace communication and provide insights for shaping their ongoing development.
Who Would You Like to Work With?,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Clyde Auditorium,Diego Gómez-Zará  Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile Matthew Paras  Northwestern University Marlon Twyman  Northwestern University Jacqueline N. Lane  Harvard Business School Leslie A. DeChurch  Northwestern University Noshir S. Contractor  Northwestern University,People and organizations are increasingly using online platforms to assemble teams. In response  HCI researchers have theorized frameworks and created systems to support team assembly. However  little is known about how users search for and choose teammates on these platforms. We conducted a field study where 530 participants used a team formation system to assemble project teams. We describe how users' traits and social networks influence their teammate searches  teammate choices  and team composition. Our results show that (a) what users initially search for differs from what they finally choose: initially they search for experts and sociable users  but they are ultimately more likely to choose their prior social connections as their teammates; (b) users' decisions lead to non-diverse and segregated teams  where most of the expertise and social capital are concentrated in a few teams. We discuss the implications of these results for designing team formation systems than promote users' agency.
Empowering End Users in Debugging Trigger-Action Rules,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Fulvio Corno  Politecnico di Torino Luigi De Russis  Politecnico di Torino Alberto Monge Roffarello  Politecnico di Torino,End users can program trigger-action rules to personalize the joint behavior of their smart devices and online services. Trigger-action programming is  however  a complex task for non-programmers and errors made during the composition of rules may lead to unpredictable behaviors and security issues  e.g.  a lamp that is continuously flashing or a door that is unexpectedly unlocked. In this paper  we introduce EUDebug  a system that enables end users to debug trigger-action rules. With EUDebug  users compose rules in a web-based application like IFTTT. EUDebug highlights possible problems that the set of all defined rules may generate and allows their step-by-step simulation. Under the hood  a hybrid Semantic Colored Petri Net (SCPN) models  checks  and simulates trigger-action rules and their interactions. An exploratory study on 15 end users shows that EUDebug helps identifying and understanding problems in trigger-action rules  which are not easily discoverable in existing platforms.
Heimdall: A Remotely Controlled Inspection Workbench For Debugging Microcontroller Projects,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Mitchell Karchemsky  University of California  Berkeley J.D. Zamfirescu-Pereira  Cornell Tech Kuan-Ju Wu  University of California  Berkeley François Guimbretière  Cornell University Björn Hartmann  University of California  Berkeley,Students and hobbyists build embedded systems that combine sensing  actuation and microcontrollers on solderless breadboards. To help students debug such circuits  experienced teachers apply visual inspection  targeted measurements  and circuit modifications to diagnose and localize the problem(s). However  experienced helpers may not always be available to review student projects in person. To enable remote debugging of circuit problems  we introduce Heimdall  a remote electronics workbench that allows experts to visually inspect a student's circuit; perform measurements; and to re-wire and inject test signals. These interactions are enabled by an actuated inspection camera; an augmented breadboard that enables flexible configuration of row connectivity and measurement/injection lines; and a web-based UI that teachers can use to perform measurements through interaction with the captured images. We demonstrate that common issues arising in embedded electronics classes can be successfully diagnosed remotely and report on preliminary user feedback from teaching assistants who frequently debug circuits.
Predicting Cognitive Load in Future Code Puzzles,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Caitlin Kelleher  Washington University in St. Louis Wint Hnin  Washington University in St. Louis,Code puzzles are an increasingly popular way to introduce youth to programming. Yet our knowledge about how to maximize learning from puzzles is incomplete. We conducted a data collection study and trained a model that predicts cognitive load  the mental effort necessary to complete a task  on a future puzzle. Controlling cognitive load can lead to more effective learning. Our model suggests that it is possible to predict Cognitive Load on future problems; the model could correctly distinguish the more difficult puzzle within a pair 71%-79% of the time. Further  studying the model itself provides new insights into the sources of puzzle difficulty  the factors that contribute to Cognitive Load  and their inter-relationships. Finally  the ability to predict Cognitive Load on a future puzzle is an important step towards the creation of adaptive code puzzle systems.
On the Latency of USB-Connected Input Devices,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Dochart 1,Raphael Wimmer  University of Regensburg Andreas Schmid  University of Regensburg Florian Bockes  University of Regensburg,We propose a method for accurately and precisely measuring the intrinsic latency of input devices and document measurements for 36 keyboards  mice and gamepads connected via USB. Our research shows that devices differ not only in average latency  but also in the distribution of their latencies  and that forced polling at 1000 Hz decreases latency for some but not all devices. Existing practices - measuring end-to-end latency as a proxy of input latency and reporting only mean values and standard deviations - hide these characteristic latency distributions caused by device intrinsics and polling rates. A probabilistic model of input device latency demonstrates these issues and matches our measurements. Thus  our work offers guidance for researchers  engineers  and hobbyists who want to measure the latency of input devices or select devices with low latency.
Thermporal: An Easy-To-Deploy Temporal Thermographic Sensor System to Support Residential Energy Audits,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Matthew Louis Mauriello  University of Maryland  College Park Brenna McNally  University of Maryland  College Park Jon E. Froehlich  University of Washington,Underperforming  degraded  and missing insulation in US residential buildings is common. Detecting these issues  however  can be difficult. Using thermal cameras during energy audits can aid in locating potential insulation issues  but prior work indicates it is challenging to determine their severity using thermal imagery alone. In this work  we present an easy-to-deploy  temporal thermographic sensor system designed to support residential energy audits through quantitative analysis of building envelope performance. We then offer an evaluation of the system through two studies: (i) a one-week  in-home field study in five homes and (ii) a semi-structured interview study with five professional energy auditors. Our results show our system helps raise awareness  improves homeowners' ability to gauge the severity of issues  and provides opportunities for new interactions between homeowners  building data  and professional auditors.
Designing Participatory Sensing with Remote Communities to Conserve Endangered Species,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Tshering Dema  Queensland University of Technology Margot Brereton  Queensland University of Technology Paul Roe  Queensland University of Technology,The increasing loss of species globally calls for effective monitoring tools and strategies to inform conservation action. The dominant approach to citizens engagement has been smart phone and platform-centric  tasking crowds to collect and analyze data. However  many critically endangered species inhabit remote areas  characterized by sparsely populated communities with poor internet connectivity. Approaches need to garner high engagement relative to population size  with data collection and knowledge synthesis suited to the local context. We conducted a field study in remote communities to understand how to enhance conservation of Bhutan's critically endangered White-bellied heron by exploring existing monitoring practices and trialing acoustic sensing technologies. We found that knowledge about the species is partial  heterogeneous  situated within and across communities and rooted in cultural beliefs. Sensors  acoustic interfaces  and playful probes provided new ways for the community to 'see' and discuss their local environment fostering them to share and grow their knowledge together. We contribute a synthesis of key considerations for designing effective participatory sensing to conserve species in remote communities.
Evaluating Sustainable Interaction Design of Digital Services: The Case of YouTube,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Chris Preist  University of Bristol Daniel Schien  University of Bristol Paul Shabajee  University of Bristol,Recent research has advocated for a broader conception of evaluation for Sustainable HCI (SHCI)  using interdisciplinary insights and methods. In this paper  we put this into practice to conduct an evaluation of Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) of digital services. We explore how SID can contribute to corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction strategies. We show how a Digital Service Provider (DSP) might incorporate SID into their design process and quantitatively evaluate a specific SID intervention by combining user analytics data with environmental life cycle assessment. We illustrate this by considering YouTube. Replacing user analytics data with aggregate estimates from publicly available sources  we estimate emissions associated with the deployment of YouTube to be approximately 10MtCO2e p.a. We estimate emissions reductions enabled through the use of an SID intervention from prior literature to be approximately 300KtCO2e p.a.  and demonstrate that this is significant when considered alongside other emissions reduction interventions used by DSPs.
The Breaking Hand: Skills  Care  and Sufferings of the Hands of an Electronic Waste Worker in Bangladesh,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Dochart 2,Mohammad Rashidujjaman Rifat  University of Toronto Hasan Mahmud Prottoy  Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed  University of Toronto,While repair work has recently been getting increasing attention in HCI  recycling practices have still remained relatively understudied  especially in the context of the Global South. To this end  building on our eight-month-long ethnography  this paper reports the electronic waste ('e-waste'  henceforth) recycling practices among the e-waste recycler ('bhangari') communities in Dhaka  Bangladesh. In doing so  this paper offers the work of the bhangaris through an articulation of their hands and their uses. Drawing from a rich body of scholarly work on social science  we define and contextualize three characteristics of the hand of a bhangari: knowledge  care  and skills and collaboration. Our study also highlights the pains and sufferings involved in this profession. By explaining bhangari work through the hand  we also discuss its implications for design  and its connection to HCI's broader interest in sustainability.

Geppetto: Enabling Semantic Design of Expressive Robot Behaviors,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Forth,Ruta Desai  Carnegie Mellon University Fraser Anderson  Autodesk Research Justin Matejka  Autodesk Research Stelian Coros  ETH Zurich James McCann  Carnegie Mellon University George Fitzmaurice  Autodesk Research Tovi Grossman  Autodesk Research,Expressive robots are useful in many contexts  from industrial to entertainment applications. However  designing expressive robot behaviors requires editing a large number of unintuitive control parameters. We present an interactive  data-driven system that allows editing of these complex parameters in a semantic space. Our system combines a physics-based simulation that captures the robot's motion capabilities  and a crowd-powered framework that extracts relationships between the robot's motion parameters and the desired semantic behavior. These relationships enable mixed-initiative exploration of possible robot motions. We specifically demonstrate our system in the context of designing emotionally expressive behaviors. A user-study finds the system to be useful for more quickly developing desirable robot behaviors  compared to manual parameter editing.
LightBee: A Self-Levitating Light Field Display for Hologrammatic Telepresence,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Forth,Xujing Zhang  Queen's University Sean Braley  Queen's University Calvin Rubens  Queen's University Timothy Merritt  Aalborg University Roel Vertegaal  Queen's University,LightBee is a novel "hologrammatic" telepresence system featuring a self-levitating light field display. It consists of a drone that flies a projection of a remote user's head through 3D space. The movements of the drone are controlled by the remote user's head movements  offering unique support for non-verbal cues  especially physical proxemics. The light field display is created by a retro-reflective sheet that is mounted on the cylindrical quadcopter. 45 smart projectors  one per 1.3 degrees  are mounted in a ring  each projecting a video stream rendered from a unique perspective onto the retroreflector. This creates a light field that naturally provides motion parallax and stereoscopy without requiring any headset nor stereo glasses. LightBee allows multiple local users to experience their own unique and correct perspective of the remote user's head. The system is currently one-directional: 2 small cameras mounted on the drone allow the remote user to observe the local scene.
Expression of Curiosity in Social Robots: Design  Perception  and Effects on Behaviour,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Forth,Jessy Ceha  University of Waterloo Nalin Chhibber  University of Waterloo Joslin Goh  University of Waterloo Corina McDonald  University of Waterloo Pierre-Yves Oudeyer  Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest Dana Kulić  University of Waterloo Edith Law  University of Waterloo,Curiosity–the intrinsic desire for new information–can enhance learning  memory  and exploration. Therefore  understanding how to elicit curiosity can inform the design of educational technologies. In this work  we investigate how a social peer robot's verbal expression of curiosity is perceived  whether it can affect the emotional feeling and behavioural expression of curiosity in students  and how it impacts learning. In a between-subjects experiment  30 participants played the game LinkIt!  a game we designed for teaching rock classification  with a robot verbally expressing: curiosity  curiosity plus rationale  or no curiosity. Results indicate that participants could recognize the robot's curiosity and that curious robots produced both emotional and behavioural curiosity contagion effects in participants.
Trigger-Action Programming for Personalising Humanoid Robot Behaviour,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Forth,Nicola Leonardi  CNR-ISTI Marco Manca  CNR-ISTI Fabio Paternò  CNR-ISTI Carmen Santoro  CNR-ISTI,In the coming years humanoid robots will be increasingly used in a variety of contexts  thereby presenting many opportunities to exploit their capabilities in terms of what they can sense and do. One main challenge is to design technologies that enable those who are not programming experts to personalize robot behaviour. We propose an end user development solution based on trigger-action personalization rules. We describe how it supports editing such rules and its underlying software architecture  and report on a user test that involved end user developers. The test results show that users were able to perform the robot personalization tasks with limited effort  and found the trigger-action environment usable and suitable for the proposed tasks. Overall  we show the potential for using trigger-action programming to make robot behaviour personalization possible even to people who are not professional software developers.
Data is Personal: Attitudes and Perceptions of Data Visualization in Rural Pennsylvania,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Evan M.

Ayuso  Bucknell University Omar El-Etr  Bucknell University,Many of the guidelines that inform how designers create data visualizations originate in studies that unintentionally exclude populations that are most likely to be among the 'data poor'. In this paper  we explore which factors may drive attention and trust in rural populations with diverse economic and educational backgrounds - a segment that is largely underrepresented in the data visualization literature. In 42 semi-structured interviews in rural Pennsylvania (USA)  we find that a complex set of factors intermix to inform attitudes and perceptions about data visualization - including educational background  political affiliation  and personal experience.

DataSelfie: Empowering People to Design Personalized Visuals to Represent Their Data,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Nam Wook Kim  Harvard University Hyejin Im  Tufts University Nathalie Henry Riche  Microsoft Research Alicia Wang  Troy High School Krzysztof Gajos  Harvard University Hanspeter Pfister  Harvard University,Many personal informatics systems allow people to collect and manage personal data and reflect more deeply about themselves. However  these tools rarely offer ways to customize how the data is visualized. In this work  we investigate the question of how to enable people to determine the representation of their data. We analyzed the Dear Data project to gain insights into the design elements of personal visualizations. We developed DataSelfie  a novel system that allows individuals to gather personal data and design custom visuals to represent the collected data. We conducted a user study to evaluate the usability of the system as well as its potential for individual and collaborative sensemaking of the data.
A Bayesian Cognition Approach to Improve Data Visualization,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Hall 1,Yea-Seul Kim  University of Washington Logan A. Walls  University of Washington Peter Krafft  University of Washington Jessica Hullman  Northwestern University,People naturally bring their prior beliefs to bear on how they interpret the new information  yet few formal models exist for accounting for the influence of users' prior beliefs in interactions with data presentations like visualizations. We demonstrate a Bayesian cognitive model for understanding how people interpret visualizations in light of prior beliefs and show how this model provides a guide for improving visualization evaluation. In a first study  we show how applying a Bayesian cognition model to a simple visualization scenario indicates that people's judgments are consistent with a hypothesis that they are doing approximate Bayesian inference. In a second study  we evaluate how sensitive our observations of Bayesian behavior are to different techniques for eliciting people subjective distributions  and to different datasets. We find that people don't behave consistently with Bayesian predictions for large sample size datasets  and this difference cannot be explained by elicitation technique. In a final study  we show how normative Bayesian inference can be used as an evaluation framework for visualizations  including of uncertainty.
Concept-Driven Visual Analytics: an Exploratory Study of Model- and Hypothesis-Based Reasoning with Visualizations,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Hall 1,In Kwon Choi  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Taylor Childers  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Nirmal Kumar Raveendranath  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Swati Mishra  Cornell University Kyle Harris  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Khairi Reda  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,Visualization tools facilitate exploratory data analysis  but fall short at supporting hypothesis-based reasoning. We conducted an exploratory study to investigate how visualizations might support a concept-driven analysis style  where users can optionally share their hypotheses and conceptual models in natural language  and receive customized plots depicting the fit of their models to the data. We report on how participants leveraged these unique affordances for visual analysis. We found that a majority of participants articulated meaningful models and predictions  utilizing them as entry points to sensemaking. We contribute an abstract typology representing the types of models participants held and externalized as data expectations. Our findings suggest ways for rearchitecting visual analytics tools to better support hypothesis- and model-based reasoning  in addition to their traditional role in exploratory analysis. We discuss the design implications and reflect on the potential benefits and challenges involved.
Friend  Collaborator  Student  Manager: How Design of an AI-Driven Game Level Editor Affects Creators,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Matthew Guzdial  Georgia Institute of Technology Nicholas Liao  Georgia Institute of Technology Jonathan Chen  Georgia Institute of Technology Shao-Yu Chen  Georgia Institute of Technology Shukan Shah  Georgia Institute of Technology Vishwa Shah  Georgia Institute of Technology Joshua Reno  Georgia Institute of Technology Gillian Smith  Worcester Polytechnic Institute Mark O Riedl  Georgia Institute of Technology,Machine learning advances have afforded an increase in algorithms capable of creating art  music  stories  games  and more. However  it is not yet well-understood how machine learning algorithms might best collaborate with people to support creative expression. To investigate how practicing designers perceive the role of AI in the creative process  we developed a game level design tool for Super Mario Bros.-style games with a built-in AI level designer. In this paper we discuss our design of the Morai Maker intelligent tool through two mixed-methods studies with a total of over one-hundred participants. Our findings are as follows: (1) level designers vary in their desired interactions with  and role of  the AI  (2) the AI prompted the level designers to alter their design practices  and (3) the level designers perceived the AI as having potential value in their design practice  varying based on their desired role for the AI.
Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment Impact on Players' Confidence,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Thomas Constant  Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers Guillaume Levieux  Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers,Difficulty is one of the major motivational pull of video games  and thus many games use Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) systems to improve the game experience. This paper describes our research investigating the influence of DDA systems on player's confidence  evaluated using an in-game bet system. Our hypothesis is that DDA systems may lead players to overconfidence  revealed by an overestimation of their success chances when betting. This boost of confidence may be a part of the positive impact of DDA systems on the quality of game experience. We explain our method to evaluate player's confidence and implement it into three games related to logical  motor and sensory difficulties. We describe two experimental conditions where difficulty is either randomly chosen or adapted using a DDA algorithm. Results show how DDA systems can lead players to high level of overconfidence.
Implicit Communication of Actionable Information in Human-AI teams,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Claire Liang  Cornell University Julia Proft  Cornell University Erik Andersen  Cornell University Ross A. Knepper  Cornell University,Humans expect their collaborators to look beyond the explicit interpretation of their words. Implicature is a common form of implicit communication that arises in natural language discourse when an utterance leverages context to imply information beyond what the words literally convey. Whereas computational methods have been proposed for interpreting and using different forms of implicature  its role in human and artificial agent collaboration has not yet been explored in a concrete domain. The results of this paper provide insights to how artificial agents should be structured to facilitate natural and efficient communication of actionable information with humans. We investigated implicature by implementing two strategies for playing Hanabi  a cooperative card game that relies heavily on communication of actionable implicit information to achieve a shared goal. In a user study with 904 completed games and 246 completed surveys  human players randomly paired with an implicature AI are 71% more likely to think their partner is human than players paired with a non-implicature AI. These teams demonstrated game performance similar to other state of the art approaches.
Friending to Flame: How Social Features Affect Player Behaviours in an Online Collectible Card Game,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Hall 2,Selen Turkay  Queensland University of Technology Sonam Adinolf  Queensland University of Technology,Online Collectible Card Games (OCCGs) are enormously popular worldwide. Previous studies found that the social aspects of physical CCGs are crucial for player engagement. However  we know little about the different types of sociability that OCCGs afford. Nor to what extent they influence players' social experiences. This mixed method online survey study focuses on a representative OCCG  Hearthstone [24] to 1) identify and define social design features and examine the extent to which players' use of these features predict their sense of community; 2) investigate participants' attitudes towards and experiences with the game community. The results show that players rarely use social features  and these features contribute differently to predicting players' sense of community. We also found emergent toxic behaviors  afforded by the social features. Findings can inform the best practices and principles in the design of OCCGs  and contribute to our understanding of players' perceptions of OCCG communities.
Evaluating Technologies with and for Disabled Children,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Island A CROWNE,Emeline Brulé  University of Sussex Oussama Metatla  University of Bristol Katta Spiel  Vienna University of Technology Ahmed Kharrufa  Newcastle University Charlotte Robinson  University of Sussex,Due to policies supporting the inclusion of disabled children in mainstream schools and the use of technologies to enable personalized schooling  there are broad research incentives and opportunities to design technologies for disabled children in educational contexts. A workshop at CHI 2018 with researchers and practitioners working on accessible and assistive technologies for children in educational settings raised two on-going challenges in this area: (1) Very few assistive technologies proposed in research are evaluated in context  notably because of the many practical constraints on evaluation when working with these small communities of diverse individuals; (2) The scholars turning their attention to context raise new design preoccupations  such as interdependence  for which we do not yet have a community consensus regarding the suitable approaches to evaluation. Although this workshop was conducted with researchers working with children with visual impairments  these challenges apply more widely to the field of technologies for children with disabilities in educational settings. The purpose of this SIG is to bring together researchers and practitioners to encourage the homogenization of evaluation approaches for accessible and assistive technologies in schools.
Communicating your Research to the Public and the Press,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Island B CROWNE,Helen Pilcher,Researchers are increasingly called upon to communicate with non-specialist audiences  but it can be difficult to communicate complex scientific topics in a way that makes them accessible and engaging to people outside the field. Further  interacting with the media can be daunting and frustrating and researchers frequently comment on how their work is misrepresented in the popular press. This course aims to give participants the skills needed to interact confidently with the media and to non-specialists  and get their key messages across.
Blending Human and Artificial Intelligence to Support Autistic Children's Social Communication Skills ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Lomond,Kaska Porayska-Pomsta  University College London Alyssa Alcorn  University College London Katerina Avramides  University College London Sandra Beale  Birkbeck College Sara Bernardini  Royal Halloway Mary Ellen Foster  University of Glasgow Christopher Frauenberger  TU Wien Judith Good  University of Sussex Karen Guldberg  University of Birmingham Wendy Elizabeth Keay-Bright  Cardiff Metropolitan University Lila Kossyvaki  University of Birmingham Oliver Lemon  Heriot Watt University Marilena Mademtzi  Yale University Rachel Menzies  University of Dundee Helen Pain  University of Edinburgh Gnanathusharan Rajendran  Heriot-Watt University Annalu Waller  University of Dundee Sam Wass  University of East London Tim J Smith  Birkbeck College,This paper examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties  aged 4-14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment  data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However  due to large individual differences within the ASC group  this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown  anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this paper offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically  the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices  (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another  and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders  including children with and without ASC diagnosis  educational practitioners and researchers.
Digital Behaviour Change Interventions to Break and Form Habits ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Lomond,Charlie Pinder  Aarhus University Jo Vermeulen  Aarhus University Benjamin R. Cowan  University College Dublin Russell Beale  University of Birmingham,Digital behaviour change interventions  particularly those using pervasive computing technology  hold great promise in supporting users to change their behaviour. However  most interventions fail to take habitual behaviour into account  limiting their potential impact. This failure is partly driven by a plethora of overlapping behaviour change theories and related strategies that do not consider the role of habits. We critically review the main theories and models used in the research to analyse their application to designing effective habitual behaviour change interventions. We highlight the potential for Dual Process Theory  modern habit theory and Goal Setting Theory  which together model how users form and break habits  to drive effective digital interventions. We synthesise these theories into an explanatory framework  the Habit Alteration Model  and use it to outline the state of the art. We identify the opportunities and challenges of habit-focused interventions.
From Being There to Watching: Shared and Dedicated Telepresence Robot Usage at Academic Conferences ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Lomond,Carman Neustaedter  Simon Fraser University Samarth Singhal  Simon Fraser University Rui Pan  Simon Fraser University Yasamin Heshmat  Simon Fraser University Azadeh Forghani  Simon Fraser University John Tang  Microsoft,Telepresence attendance at academic conferences is now a reality and allows people who cannot attend in person with the opportunity to still be 'present.' This is valuable for people who face accessibility challenges  cost or travel restrictions  or limited time for travel. We have deployed and studied the use of telepresence robots at three ACM conferences  Ubicomp/ISWC 2014  CSCW 2016  and CHI 2016  ranging from remote users having dedicated telepresence robots to users sharing telepresence robots both synchronously and asynchronously. In this article  we report on the telepresence offerings along with the user behaviors  experiences  and the social norms found for remote conference attendance. Our results across the studies focus around three main themes: shared vs. dedicated robot usage  identity presentation and the value and challenges associated with it; and local in-person support through proxies and instant messaging backchannels. These themes point to three different areas of design exploration for telepresence robots  pointing out the limitations of existing design solutions with respect to each theme  areas for future telepresence design work  and the value in considering varied telepresence robot solutions  including both dedicated and shared telepresence robots.
Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff: A Formal Information-Theoretic Transmission Scheme (FITTS) ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 09:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 10:20,Lomond,Julien Gori  Telecom ParisTech Olivier Rioul  Telecom ParisTech Yves Guiard  CNRS & Telecom-Paristech,The rationale for Fitts' law is that pointing tasks have the information-theoretic analogy of sending a signal over a noisy channel  thereby matching Shannon's capacity formula. Yet  the currently received analysis is incomplete and unsatisfactory: There is no explicit communication model for pointing; there is a confusion between central concepts of capacity (a mathematical limit)  throughput (an average performance measure)  and bandwidth (a physical quantity); and there is also a confusion between source and channel coding so that Shannon's Theorem 17 can be misinterpreted. We develop an information-theoretic model for pointing tasks where the index of difficulty (ID) is the expression of both a source entropy and a zero-error channel capacity. Then  we extend the model to include misses at rate ? and prove that ID should be adjusted to (1??) ID. Finally  we reflect on Shannon's channel coding theorem and argue that only minimum movement times  not performance averages  should be considered.

INT001: ScaleDial: A Novel Tangible Device for Teaching Musical Scales & Triads,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Konstantin Klamka  Technische Universität Dresden Jannik Wojnar  Technische Universität Dresden Raimund Dachselt  Technische Universität Dresden,The teaching of harmonic foundations in music is a common learning objective in many education systems. However  music theory is often considered as a non-interactive subject matter that requires huge efforts to understand. With this work  we contribute a novel tangible device  called ScaleDial  that makes use of the relations between geometry and music theory to provide interactive  graspable and playful learning experiences. Therefore  we introduce an innovative tangible cylinder and demonstrate how harmonic relationships can be explored through a physical set of digital manipulatives  that can be arranged and stacked on top of an interactive chromatic circle. Based on the tangible interaction and further rich visual and auditory output capabilities  ScaleDial enables a better understanding of scales  pitch constellations  triads  as well as intervals. Further  we describe the technical realization of our advanced prototype and show how we fabricate the magnetic  capacitive and mechanical sensing.
INT002: ClassBeacons: Enhancing Reflection-in-Action of Teachers through Spatially Distributed Ambient Information,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Pengcheng An  Eindhoven University of Technology Saskia Bakker  Eindhoven University of Technology Sara Ordanovski  Utrecht University Ruurd Taconis  Eindhoven University of Technology Chris L. E. Paffen  Utrecht University Berry Eggen  Eindhoven University of Technology,Reflection-in-action (RiA) refers to teachers' reflections on their teaching performance during busy classroom routines. RiA is a demanding competence for teachers  but little has been known about how HCI systems could support teachers' RiA during their busy and intensive teaching. To bridge this gap  we design and evaluate an ambient information system named ClassBeacons. ClassBeacons aims to help teachers intuitively reflect-in-action on how to divide time and attention over pupils throughout a lesson. ClassBeacons subtly depicts teachers' division of time and attention over pupils through multiple light-objects distributed over students' desks. Each light-object indicates how long the teacher has been cumulatively around it (helping an adjacent student) by shifting color. A field evaluation with eleven teachers proved that ClassBeacons enhanced teachers' RiA by supporting their sensemaking of ongoing performance and modification of upcoming actions. Furthermore  ClassBeacons was experienced to unobtrusively fit into teachers' routines without overburdening teaching in progress.
INT003: Physical Programming for Blind and Low Vision Children at Scale,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Nicolas Villar  Microsoft Research Cecily Morrison  Microsoft Research Daniel Cletheroe  Microsoft Research Tim Regan  Microsoft Research Anja Thieme  Microsoft Research Greg Saul  Microsoft Research,There is a dearth of appropriate tools for young learners with mixed visual abilities to engage with computational learning. Addressing this gap  we present Project Torino  a physical programming language for teaching computational learning to children ages 7-11 regardless of level of vision. To create code  children connect and manipulate tactile objects to create music  audio stories  or poetry. Designed to be made and deployed at scale  Project Torino (along with a scheme of work) has been successfully used by 30 non-specialist teachers with 75 children across the UK over three months.

INT005: Tangible Interactions with Acoustic Levitation,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Asier Marzo  Universidad Publica de Navarra Steven Kockaya  University of Bristol Euan Freeman  University of Glasgow Julie Williamson  University of Glasgow,Acoustic Levitation can hold millimetric objects in mid-air without any physical contact. This capability has been exploited to create displays since being able to position mid-air physical voxels enables for rich data representations. However  most of the times interesting features of acoustic levitation are not exploited. Acoustic Levitation is harmless and sound diffracts around objects  thus we can insert our hand inside the levitator and touch the levitated particles without harmful effect on us. In this demo  we showcase more tangible interactions with acoustically levitated particles by passing acoustically-transparent structures through the particles  manipulating particles in mid-air with wearable levitators or by moving multiple particles with direct manipulation. We hope that this demo provides a more tangible experience of acoustic levitation. Since all the presented devices are Do-It-Yourself  we encourage visitors to experiment further with acoustic levitation.

We demonstrate these capabilities with an ultrasonic phased array that allows users to interactively manipulate levitating objects with mid-air hand gestures whilst also receiving auditory feedback via highly directional parametric audio  and haptic feedback via focused ultrasound onto their bare hands. Therefore  this demo presents the first ever ultrasound rig which conveys information to three different sensory channels and levitates small objects simultaneously.

In our demo  we show a concept of futuristic shopping experience with a tangible 3D mid-air interface that allows customers to directly select and explore realistic virtual products using autostereoscopic 3D display combined with mid-air haptics and finger tracker. We also present an example of in-store shopping scenario for natural interactions with 3D. This shopping experience will engage users in producing a memorable in-store experience with the merging of digital and physical interactions.

We demonstrate an implementation of a New York Times style crossword puzzle  providing interactions to query location and stored data  ask for clues in across and down directions  edit and fill in the crossword puzzle using a Perkins style braille keyboard or a typewriter-style keyboard   and verify answers. Through our demonstration  we explore tradeoffs related to available tactile real estate  and overcrowding of the tactile image with a view toward reducing the cognitive workload involved in retaining a working mental model of the active grid  and the time to complete a letter placement task.

However  currently available games fall short because of either limited synchronicity or limited opportunities for player movement. Here  we present Brick  a synchronous multiplayer AR game at the room scale. Brick's players collaborate to fill in a pattern of empty slots using digital "bricks" scattered about the room. This paper provides an overview of Brick from a design and technical perspective. It also discusses how Brick extends the current scope of AR games to include collaborative gameplay.

Depping  University of Saskatchewan Regan Mandryk  University of Saskatchewan James Collin Fey  University of California  Santa Cruz Katherine Isbister  University of California  Santa Cruz,Social closeness is important for an individual's health and well-being  and this is especially difficult to maintain over a distance. Games can help with this  to connect and strengthen relationships or create new ones by enabling shared playful experiences. The demo proposed is a game we designed called 'In the Same Boat'  a two-player game intended to foster social closeness between players over a distance. We leverage the synchronization of both players' physiological data (heart rate  breathing facial expressions) mapped to an input scheme to control the movement of a canoe down a river.

Like in other sports  proper training leads to a faster increase of skill and lessens the risk of injuries. We chose a set of exercises from slackline literature and implemented an interactive trainer which guides the user through the exercises giving feedback if the exercises were executed correctly. Based on lessons learned from our study and prior demonstrations we present a revised version of Slackliner that uses head tracking to better guide the user's attention and movements. Additionally a new visual indicator informs the trainee about her arm posture during the performance. This has been also included in an updated post-analysis view that provides the trainee with more detailed feedback about her performance. The present demo showcases an interactive sports training system that provides in-situ feedback while following a well-guided learning procedure.

Love  Abertay University Mona Bozdog  Abertay University,Ola De La Vida is a three-player cooperative game installation which is designed to harness the qualities of social play environment such as an arcade or play party (an event which mixes games  music  dance and socializing). Ola De La Vida uses physical and digital design techniques that consider the unique qualities of a social play space being sensitive to the complex personal  social and interpersonal aspects each player may experience. The game installation uses its scale to heighten the visibility of the game in a crowded play space  custom control methods to lower barriers to entry and costume to promote teamwork  collaboration and to lower social anxieties. These techniques  in partnership with the digital-physical nature of the game play aims to entice players and spectators in a social environment to participate. Through this installation we hope to encourage discussion around designing for participation and the challenges of social play.

This floor is combined with a multiple projector system to reduce occlusions from players' interactions with the floor. Individual displays  an HTC Vive to track player position  and smart watches were added to provide an extra layer of interactivity. We created this interactive experience to explore collaboration between people when interacting with large displays. We contribute a novel combination of different technologies for this game system and our studies showed this game is both entertaining and provides players with motivation to stay physically active. We believe presenting at interactivity would be a benefit to both our research and to the attendees of CHI 2019.
INT015: FoldTronics Demo: Creating 3D Objects with Integrated Electronics Using Foldable Honeycomb Structures,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Junichi Yamaoka  Massachusetts Institute of Technology & University of Tokyo Mustafa Doga Dogan  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Katarina Bulovic  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Kazuya Saito  University of Tokyo Yoshihiro Kawahara  University of Tokyo Yasuaki Kakehi  University of Tokyo Stefanie Mueller  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,We present FoldTronics  a 2D-cutting based fabrication technique to integrate electronics into 3D folded objects. The key idea is to cut and perforate a 2D sheet using a cutting plotter to make it foldable into a 3D honeycomb structure; before folding  users place the electronic components and circuitry onto the sheet. The fabrication process only takes a few minutes allowing to rapidly prototype functional interactive devices. The resulting objects are lightweight and rigid  thus allowing for weight-sensitive and force-sensitive applications. Due to the nature of honeycombs  the created objects can be folded flat along one axis and thus can be efficiently transported in this compact form factor.
INT016: Demonstrating Kyub: A 3D Editor for Modeling Sturdy Laser-Cut Objects,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Patrick Baudisch  Hasso Plattner Institute Arthur Silber  Hasso Plattner Institute Yannis Kommana  Hasso Plattner Institute Milan Gruner  Hasso Plattner Institute Ludwig Wall  Hasso Plattner Institute Kevin Reuss  Hasso Plattner Institute Lukas Heilmann  Hasso-Plattner-Institut Robert Kovacs  Hasso Plattner Institute Daniel Rechlitz  Hasso Plattner Institute Thijs Roumen  Hasso Plattner Institute,We present an interactive editing system for laser cutting called kyub. Kyub allows users to create models efficiently in 3D  which it then unfolds into the 2D plates laser cutters expect. Unlike earlier systems  such as FlatFitFab  kyub affords construction based on closed box structures  which allows users to turn very thin material  such as 4mm plywood  into objects capable of withstanding large forces  such as chairs users can actually sit on. To afford such sturdy construction  every kyub project begins with a simple finger-joint "boxel"—a structure we found to be capable of withstanding over 500kg of load. Users then extend their model by attaching additional boxels. Boxels merge automatically  resulting in larger  yet equally strong structures. While the concept of stacking boxels allows kyub to offer the strong affordance and ease of use of a voxel-based editor  boxels are not confined to a grid and readily combine with kuyb's various geometry deformation tools. In our technical evaluation  objects built with kyub withstood hundreds of kilograms of loads. We demonstrate the kyub software to the CHI audience and allow them to experience the resulting models first hand.
INT017: Digital Fabrication of Soft Actuated Objects by Machine Knitting,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lea Albaugh  Carnegie Mellon University Scott Hudson  Carnegie Mellon University Lining Yao  Carnegie Mellon University,With recent interest in shape-changing interfaces  material-driven design  wearable technologies  and soft robotics  digital fabrication of soft actuatable material is increasingly in demand. Much of this research focuses on elastomers or non-stretchy air bladders. In this work  we explore a series of design strategies for machine knitting actuated soft objects by integrating tendons with shaping and anisotropic texture design.
INT018: Painting with CATS: Camera-Aided Texture Synthesis,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ticha Sethapakdi  Carnegie Mellon University James McCann  Carnegie Mellon University,We present CATS  a digital painting system that synthesizes textures from live video in real-time  short-cutting the typical brush- and texture- gathering workflow. Through the use of boundary-aware texture synthesis  CATS produces strokes that are non-repeating and blend smoothly with each other. This allows CATS to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. We evaluated the effectiveness of CATS by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that CATS is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings.
INT019: Flowboard: A Visual Flow-Based Programming Environment for Embedded Coding,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anke Brocker  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Tony Zelun Zhang  RWTH Aachen University Mathis Müller  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,With Maker-friendly environments like the Arduino IDE  embedded programming has become an important part of STEM education. But learning embedded programming is still hard  requiring both coding and basic electronics skills. To understand if a different programming paradigm can help  we developed Flowboard  which uses Flow-Based Programming (FBP) rather than the usual imperative programming paradigm. Instead of command sequences  learners assemble processing nodes into a graph through which signals and data flow. Flowboard consists of a visual flow-based editor on an iPad  a hardware frame integrating the iPad  an Arduino board and two breadboards next to the iPad  letting learners connect their visual graphs seamlessly to the input and output electronics. Graph edits take effect immediately  making Flowboard a live coding environment.
INT020: Live Programming By Example,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Mark Santolucito  Yale University William T. Hallahan  Yale University Ruzica Piskac  Yale University,Live programming is a novel approach for programming practice. Programmers are given real-time feedback when writing code  traditionally via a graphical user interface. Despite live programming's practical values  such as providing an easier overview of code and better understanding of its structure  it is not yet widely used. In this work  we extend live programming to general purpose code editors  which allows for live programming to be used by programmers  and provides new interfaces for understanding and changing the functionality of code. To achieve this we extended a fully-featured IDE with the ability to show input/output examples of code execution  as the programmer is writing code. Furthermore  we integrate programming by example (PBE) synthesis into our tool by allowing the user to change the shown output  and have the code update automatically. Our goal is to use live programming to give novice programmers a new way to interact and understand programming  as well as being a useful development tool for more advanced programmers.
INT021: Dynamic Depth-of-Field Projection for 3D Projection Mapping,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Lihui Wang  University of Tokyo Hongjin Xu  University of Tokyo Yunpu Hu  University of Tokyo Satoshi Tabata  University of Tokyo Masatoshi Ishikawa  University of Tokyo,Demonstration for a dynamic depth-of-field projection mapping on a 3D moving object would be performed. Conventional projection mapping was limited on 2D space  due to their narrow depth-of-field projection range. Our system included a high-speed projector  a high-speed variable focus lens  a depth sensor by a stereo camera  so that the depth information would be detected and then served as feedback to correct the focal length of the projection. As a result  a projection mapping would be well-focused projected on a 3D dynamic moving object.
INT022: Demonstration of Springlets: Expressive  Flexible and Silent On-Skin Tactile Interfaces,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Nur Al-huda Hamdan  RWTH Aachen University Adrian Wagner  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University Jürgen Steimle  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus,We present Springlets  expressive  non-vibrating mechanotactile interfaces on the skin. Embedded with shape memory alloy springs  we implement Springlets as thin and flexible stickers to be worn on various body locations  thanks to their silent operation even on the neck and head. We present a technically simple and rapid technique for fabricating a wide range of Springlet interfaces. We developed six modular Springlets: a pincher  a directional stretcher  a presser  a puller  a dragger  and an expander (Fig. 1). In our hands-on demonstration  we show our modular Springlets and several Springlet interfaces for tactile social communication  physical guidance  health interfaces  navigation  and virtual reality gaming. Attendees can wear the interfaces and explore their expressive variable force profiles and spatiotemporal patterns.
INT023: A Sensing Technique for Data Glove Using Conductive Fiber,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ryosuke Takada  University of Tsukuba Junichiro Kadomoto  The Univesity of Tokyo Buntarou Shizuki  University of Tsukuba,We demonstrate a sensing technique for data gloves using conductive fiber. This technique enables us to estimate hand shapes (bend of a finger and contact between fingers) and differentiates a grabbing tag. To estimate how far each finger bends  the electrical resistance of the conductive fiber is measured; this resistance decreases as the finger bends because the surface of the glove short circuits. To detect contact between fingers  we apply alternating currents with different frequencies to each finger and measure the signal propagation between the fingers. This principle is also used to differentiate a grabbing tag (each tag has an alternating current with a unique frequency). We developed a prototype data glove based on this technique.
INT024: LUNE: Representing Lunar Day by Displayed Lighting Object,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sung ho Lee  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Seong beom Kim  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Byoung hern Kim  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Hui sung Lee  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,LUNE is a displayed lighting object representing time. It provides real-time lighting visualized moon phase. People can recognize the date of month through abstract image of moon. This product was developed to investigate the use of metaphor from lighting to represent time. A diverse set of researches and design initiatives related to time  temporality and slowness has emerged in the DIS and HCI communities. An important area of work is to represent time. The primary objective of this research is to suggest the new perspective of time called sense of time. First  we can understand how people perceive the time and we can also trace recent research related to perspectives of time in HCI. Second  we designed artifacts and investigated the use of moon phase as material to represent time in a new approach.
INT025: Bear & Co: Simulating Value Conflicts in IoT Development,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Annelie Berner  Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design Monica Seyfried  Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design Calle Nordenskjöld  Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design Peter Kuhberg  Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design Irina Shklovski  IT University of Copenhagen,Bear & Co. is a fictitious immersion into the world of being part of an IOT start-up. We invite visitors to join the company  and facilitate their journey through various ethical conundrums  as they become part of the company. First  they must state their values - what they will bring to the company and care most about. Then  we test those values through different scenarios and problems that are unexpected and that do not have easy answers. Finally  we debrief our visitors and invite them to peruse explanations for various ethical approaches presented as maps and diagrams  where they can interrogate their own decisions against three different philosophical viewpoints.
INT026: An Exploration of Responsive and Emotive Wearables through Research Prototyping,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Rain Ashford  Goldsmiths  University of London,Responsive and Emotive wearables are concerned with the visualisation of environmental and physiological data. Four research prototypes were created for doctoral research to investigate the possibility that wearable technology could be used to create new forms of nonverbal communication using physiological data from the wearer's body. The research investigated who the audience might be for these research prototypes and their concerns and requirements. Through a lens of how these artifacts might they be used in social or formal contexts  the research gathered data from fifty potential users of emotive wearables and examined the usage and user preferences of such devices. Findings reflected the concerns of potential users from aesthetics and functionality to ethical and privacy issues.

This interactive artwork is experienced through the HTC Vive headset  with movement and touch key elements to the aesthetic of this work. It combines both a physical and a digital sculpture and in doing so creates a mixed reality that plays on a disconnect between what we can see and what we can feel.
INT028: Hypercept: Speculating the Visual World Intervened by Digital Media,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jiabao Li  Harvard Graduate School of Design Honghao Deng  Harvard Graduate School of Design Panagiotis Michalatos  Harvard Graduate School of Design,Human perception has long been influenced by technological breakthroughs. An intimate mediation of technology lies in between our direct perceptions and the environment we perceive. Through three extreme ideal types of perceptual machines  this project defamiliarizes and questions the habitual ways in which we interpret  operate  and understand the visual world intervened by digital media. The three machines create: Hyper-sensitive vision – a speculation on social media's amplification effect and our filtered communication landscape. Hyper-focused vision – an analogue version of the searching behavior on the Internet. Hyper-commoditized vision – monetized vision that meditates on the omnipresent advertisement targeted all over our visual field. The site of intervention is the visual field in a technologically augmented society. All the three machines have both internal state and external signal.

INT030: Come Hither to Me: Performance of a Seductive Robot,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Sahar Sajadieh  University of California  Santa Barbara Hannah Wolfe  University of California  Santa Barbara,Come Hither to Me is an interactive robotic performance  which examines the emotive social interaction between an audience and a robot. Our interactive robot attempts to communicate and flirt with audience members in the gallery. The robot uses feedback from sensors  auditory data  and computer vision techniques to learn about the participants and inform its conversation. The female robot approaches the audience  picks her favorites  and starts charming them with seductive comments  funny remarks  backhanded compliments  and personal questions. We are interested in evoking emotions in the participating audience through their interactions with the robot. Come Hither to Me strives to invert gender roles and stereotypical expectations in flirtatious interactions. This performative piece explores the dynamics of social communication  objectification of women  and the gamification of seduction. The robot reduces flirtation to an algorithm  codifying pick-up lines and sexting paradigms.
INT031: Eyes: Iris Sonification and Interactive Biometric Art,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yoon Chung Han  San Jose State University Praful Surve  California State University  Fullerton,"Eyes" is an interactive biometric data art that transforms human's Iris data into musical sound and 3D animated image. The idea is to allow the audience to explore their own identities through unique visual and sound generated by their iris patterns based on iris recognition and image processing techniques. Selected iris images are printed in 3D sculptures  and it replays the sound and animated images on the sculptures. This research-based artwork has an experimental system generating distinct sounds for each different iris data using visual features such as colors  patterns  brightness and size of the iris. It has potentials to lead the new way of interpreting complicated dataset with the audiovisual output. Moreover  aesthetically beautiful  mesmerizing and uncanny valley-effected artwork can create personalized art experience and multimodal interaction. Multisensory interpretations of this data art can lead a new opportunity to reveal users' narratives and create their own "sonic signature."

It allows the audience to experience their unique data-driven artificial life form - dandelion as embodied and possessed through their facial features  heartbeat signal  and emotion expression in artistic expression.
INT033: Death Ground,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Christos Michalakos  Abertay University Bernt Isak Wærstad  Norwegian University of Science and Technology,Death Ground is a competitive musical installation-game for two players. The work is designed to provide the framework for the players/participants in which to perform game-mediated musical gestures against each-other. The main mechanic involves destroying the other player's avatar by outmaneuvering and using audio weapons and improvised musical actions against it. These weapons are spawned in an enclosed area during the performance and can be used by whoever is collects them first. There is a multitude of such power-ups  all of which have different properties  such as speed boost  additional damage  ground traps and so on. All of these weapons affect the sound and sonic textures that each of the avatars produce. Additionally  the players can use elements of the environment such as platforms  obstructions and elevation in order to gain competitive advantage  or position themselves strategically to access first the spawned power-ups.
INT034: Keycube is a Kind of Keyboard (k^(3)),Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Damien Brun  Université TÉLUQ Charles Gouin-Vallerand  Université TÉLUQ Sébastien George  Le Mans Université,Alternate realities through headsets  such as augmented  mixed and virtual reality are becoming part of people's everyday life. Except in some limited context  usual keyboards are inappropriate for such technological medium and alternative interfaces for text-entry must be explored. In this paper we present the keycube  a general-purpose cubic handheld device that goes beyond the text-entry interface by including multiple keys  a touch-screen  an inertial unit with six degrees-of-freedom and a vibrotactile feedback. Strong of its form factor and affordance  the keycube offers advantages with regards to mobility  comfort  learnability  privacy and playfulness. Thus  the combination creates a novel text-entry interface convenient for many use cases across the whole reality-virtuality continuum.

We built a computational perception model using a data-driven approach from the collected data pairs of mass properties and perceived shapes. This enables Transcalibur to easily and effectively provide convincing shape perception based on complex illusory effects. Our user study showed that the system succeeded in providing the perception of various desired shapes in a virtual environment. In the demonstration  users can explore VR application that can feel the sensation of wielding sword  shield and crossbow and with these fight with a dragon.
INT036: VRChairRacer: Using an Office Chair Backrest as a Locomotion Technique for VR Racing Games,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Julius von Willich  TU Darmstadt Dominik Schön  TU Darmstadt Sebastian Günther  TU Darmstadt Florian Müller  TU Darmstadt Max Mühlhäuser  TU Darmstadt Markus Funk  TU Darmstadt,Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) is an important topic as there is a mismatch between the size of a Virtual Environment and the physically available tracking space. Although many locomotion techniques have been proposed  research on VR locomotion has not concluded yet. In this demonstration  we contribute to the area of VR locomotion by introducing VRChairRacer. VRChairRacer presents a novel mapping the velocity of a racing cart on the backrest of an office chair. Further  it maps a users' rotation onto the steering of a virtual racing cart. VRChairRacer demonstrates this locomotion technique to the community through an immersive multiplayer racing demo.

Through immersive game-play on the Oculus Rift  users explore Spanish translations of everyday household items in a search-and-find format  scoring points when they can correctly identify and select objects. Users are able to put what they learn into practice in real time. Study participants who tried the experience said they found this method of language learning to be more enjoyable than traditional methods of studying due to the gamification created and it not "feeling like studying". As virtual reality headsets continue to become more accessible to the public  addresses the cost limitations of traveling overseas to achieve immersion in foreign language. This application can be expanded to most real-world scenarios and locations. Additionally  it can be applied to any language.
INT040: Experiencing a Mirrored World with Geotagged Social Media in Geollery,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Ruofei Du  University of Maryland  College Park David Li  University of Maryland  College Park Amitabh Varshney  University of Maryland  College Park,We demonstrate the online deployment of Geollery  a mixed reality social media platform. We introduce an interactive pipeline to reconstruct a mirrored world at two levels of detail - the street level and the bird's-eye view. Instead of using offline 3D reconstruction approaches  our system streams and renders a mirrored world in real time  while depicting geotagged social media as billboards  balloons  framed photos  and virtual gifts. Geollery allows multiple users to see  chat  and collaboratively sketch with spatial context in this mirrored world. We demonstrate a wide range of use cases including crowdsourced tourism  interactive audio guide with immersive spatial context  and meeting remote friends in mixed reality. We envision Geollery will be inspiring and useful as a standalone social media platform for those looking to explore new areas or looking to share their experiences. Please refer to https://geollery.com for the paper and live demos.
INT041: Egocentric Smaller-person Experience through a Change in Visual Perspective,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Jun Nishida  University of Chicago Soichiro Matsuda  University of Tsukuba Mika Oki  University of Tsukuba Hikaru Takatori  University of Tsukuba Kosuke Sato  University of Tsukuba Kenji Suzuki  University of Tsukuba,This paper explores how human perceptions  actions  and interactions can be changed through an embodied and active experience of being a smaller person in a real-world environment  which we call an egocentric smaller person experience. We developed a wearable visual translator that provides the perspective of a smaller person by shifting the wearer's eyesight level down to their waist using a head-mounted display and a stereo camera module  while allowing for field of view control through head movements. In this study  we investigated how the developed device can modify the wearer's body representation and experiences based on a field study conducted at a nursing school and museums  and through lab studies. Using this device  designers and teachers can understand the perspectives of a smaller-person including a child in an existing environment.

INT044: Multisensory Virtual Environment for Fire Evacuation Training,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Tommy Nilsson  University of Nottingham Tessa Roper  University of Nottingham Emily Shaw  University of Nottingham Glyn Lawson  University of Nottingham Sue V. G. Cobb  University of Nottingham Hsieh Meng-Ko  University of Nottingham Daniel Miller  University of Nottingham James Khan  University of Nottingham,Growing organizational safety awareness is propelling the interest in development of novel solutions for fire training. Significant effort in this area has previously gone into designing various immersive virtual reality (VR) systems in hopes of enabling safe exploration and experiencing the consequences of ones actions in scenarios that would be too hazardous in the real life. Yet  the fact that VR generally lacks the sensory feedback of a real life fire situation has been found to impede a sense of realism and validity of such experiences. As part of our efforts to mitigate this issue  we now present a new prototype fire evacuation simulator designed to deliver not just audiovisual feedback  but likewise real-time heat and scent stimulation.
INT045: 3D Positional Movement Interaction with User-Defined  Virtual Interface for Music Software: MoveMIDI,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Timothy Arterbury  Baylor University G. Michael Poor  Baylor University,This paper describes progress made in design and development of a new digital musical instrument (MIDI controller)  MoveMIDI  and highlights its unique 3D positional movement interaction design differing from recent orientational and gestural approaches. A user constructs and interacts with MoveMIDI's virtual  3D interface using handheld position-tracked controllers to control music software  as well as non-musical technology such as stage lighting. MoveMIDI's virtual interface contributes to solving problems difficult to solve with hardware MIDI controller interfaces such as customized positioning and instantiation of interface elements  and accurate  simultaneous control of independent parameters. MoveMIDI's positional interaction mirrors interaction with some physical acoustic instruments and provides visualization for an audience. Beta testers of MoveMIDI have created emergent use cases for the instrument.
INT046: Are Drones Meditative?,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Joseph La Delfa  RMIT University Mehmet Aydin Baytas  Qualisys AB Olivia Wichtowski  RMIT University Rohit Ashok Khot  RMIT University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University,Meditative movement involves regulating attention to the body whilst moving  to create a state of meditation. This can be difficult for beginners  we propose that drones can facilitate this as they can move with and give feedback to whole body movements. We present a demonstration that explores various ways drones could facilitate meditative movement by drawing attention to the body. We designed a two-handed control map for the drone that engages multiple parts of the body  a light foam casing to give the impression that the drone is floating and an onboard light which gives feedback to the speed of the movement. The user will experience both leading and following the drone to explore the interplay between mapping  form  feedback and instruction. The demonstration relates to an expansion of the attention regulation framework  which is used to inform the design of interactive meditative experiences and human-drone interactions.
INT047: iScream!: Towards the Design of Playful Gustosonic Experiences with Ice Cream,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Yan Wang  RMIT University Zhuying Li  RMIT University Robert Jarvis  RMIT University Rohit Ashok Khot  RMIT University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University,In this demonstration  we present iScream!  a novel gustosonic experience that generates unique digital sounds as a result of eating ice cream. The system uses capacitive sensing to detect eating actions and based on these actions  it plays out six different playful sounds to facilitate a playful eating experience. Our aim is to support a playful way of eating because we believe that interactive technology offers unique opportunities to facilitate novel engaging eating experiences. Ultimately  with this work  we aim to inspire and guide designers working with interactive playful gustosonic experiences  which open up new interaction possibilities to experience eating as play.

It was pilot tested in a school among 16 primary schoolchildren. The results show that the installation encourages schoolchildren to synchronise their movement through play. The installation matches CHI 2019 theme of weaving the threads of CHI and playing the game at CHI symbolises the Celtic knot logo of strength and friendship.
INT049: Movie+: Towards Exploring Social Effects of Emotional Fingerprints for Video Clips and Movies,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Anton Fedosov  Università della Svizzera italiana Bianca Stancu  Università della Svizzera italiana Elena Di Lascio  Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) Davide Eynard  Università della Svizzera italiana Marc Langheinrich  Faculty of Computer Science,Collaborative movie viewing with the loved ones increases connectedness and social bonds within family members and friends. Furthermore  with the rapid adoption of personal mobile devices  people often engage in this activity being geographically separated. However  conveying our feelings and emotions about a recently watched movie or a video clip is often limited to a post on social media or a short blurb on an instant messaging app. Drawing on the popular interest in quantified-self  which envisioned one collecting and sharing biophysical information from everyday routines (e.g.  workouts)  we have designed and developed Movie+  a mobile application  which utilizes personal biophysical data to construct an individual's "emotional fingerprint" while viewing a video clip. Movie+ allows the selective sharing of this information through different visualization options  as well as rendering others' emotional fingerprints over the same clip. In this submission  we outline the design rationale and briefly describe our application prototype.
INT050: PhotoFlow in Action: Picture-Mediated Reminiscence Supporting Family Socio-Connectivity,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Benett Axtell  University of Toronto Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto & University of Toronto Mississauga,Family connections are maintained through sharing reminiscences  often supported by family photographs which easily prompt memories. This is increasingly important as we age  as picture-based reminiscence has been shown to reduce older adults' social isolation. However  there is a gap between sharing memories from physical pictures and the limited support for oral social reminiscence afforded by digital tools. PhotoFlow supports older adults' picture-mediated social storytelling of family memories using an intuitive metaphor mirroring sharing physical family pictures on a table top. The app uses the speech of oral storytelling to automatically organize pictures based only on what has been said. This simplifies the overall process of family picture interactions by leveraging one enjoyable aspect to ease a more effortful one. In particular  the familiar table top interaction metaphor has the potential to bridge the gap between physical picture reminiscence and managing digital picture collections.
JigFab: Computational Fabrication of Constraints to Facilitate Woodworking with Power Tools,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Danny Leen  Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Tom Veuskens  Hasselt University Kris Luyten  Hasselt University - tUL - Flanders Make Raf Ramakers  Hasselt University,We present JigFab  an integrated end-to-end system that supports casual makers in designing and fabricating constructions with power tools. Starting from a digital version of the construction  JigFab achieves this by generating various types of constraints that configure and physically aid the movement of a power tool. Constraints are generated for every operation and are custom to the work piece. Constraints are laser cut and assembled together with predefined parts to reduce waste. JigFab's constraints are used according to an interactive step-by-step manual. JigFab internalizes all the required domain knowledge for designing and building intricate structures  consisting of various types of finger joints  tenon & mortise joints  grooves  and dowels. Building such structures is normally reserved for artisans or automated with advanced CNC machinery.
LBW1322: Lucid Loop: A Virtual Deep Learning Biofeedback System for Lucid Dreaming Practice,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Alexandra Kitson  Simon Fraser University Steve DiPaola  Simon Fraser University Bernhard E. Riecke  Simon Fraser University,Lucid dreaming  knowing one is dreaming while dreaming  is an important tool for exploring consciousness and bringing awareness to different aspects of life. We present a proof-of-concept system called Lucid Loop: a virtual reality experience where one can practice lucid awareness via biofeedback. Visuals are creatively generated before your eyes using a deep learning Artificial Intelligence algorithm to emulate the unstable and ambiguous nature of dreams. The virtual environment becomes more lucid or "clear" when the participant's physiological signals  including brain waves  respiration  and heart rate  indicate focused attention. Lucid Loop enables the virtual embodied experience of practicing lucid dreaming where written descriptions fail. It offers a valuable and novel technique for simulating lucid dreaming without having to be asleep. Future developments will validate the system and evaluate its ability to improve lucidity within the system by detecting and adapting to a participants awareness.
CodeGazer: Making Code Navigation Easy and Natural With Gaze Input,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Asma Shakil  Media Design School & University of Auckland Christof Lutteroth  University of Bath & University of Auckland Gerald Weber  University of Auckland,Navigating source code  an activity common in software development  is time consuming and in need of improvement. We present CodeGazer  a prototype for source code navigation using eye gaze for common navigation functions. These functions include actions such as "Go to Definition'' and "Find All Usages'' of an identifier  navigate to files and methods  move back and forth between visited points in code and scrolling. We present user study results showing that many users liked and even preferred the gaze-based navigation  in particular the "Go to Definition'' function. Gaze-based navigation is also holding up well in completion time when compared to traditional methods. We discuss how eye gaze can be integrated into traditional mouse & keyboard applications in order to make "look up'' tasks more natural.
LBW1416: What You Sketch Is What You Get: Quick and Easy Augmented Reality Prototyping with PintAR,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 10:20:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 11:00,Hall 4,Danilo Gasques  University of California  San Diego Janet G. Johnson  University of California  San Diego Tommy Sharkey  University of California  San Diego Nadir Weibel  University of California  San Diego,Augmented Reality(AR) tools are currently primarily targeted at programmers  making designing for AR challenging and time-consuming. We developed an interactive prototype  PintAR  that enables the authoring and rapid-prototyping of situated experiences by allowing designers to bring their ideas to life using a digital pen for sketching and a head-mounted display for visualizing and interacting with virtual content. In this paper  we explore the versatility such a tool could provide through case studies of a researcher  an artist  a ballerina  and a clinician.

r/science: Challenges and Opportunities in Online Science Communication,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Ridley Jones  University of Washington Lucas Colusso  University of Washington Katharina Reinecke  University of Washington Gary Hsieh  University of Washington,Online discussion websites  such as Reddit's r/science forum  have the potential to foster science communication between researchers and the general public. However  little is known about who participates  what is discussed  and whether such websites are successful in achieving meaningful science discussions. To find out  we conducted a mixed-methods study analyzing 11 859 r/science posts and conducting interviews with 18 community members. Our results show that r/science facilitates rich information exchange and that the comments section provides a unique science communication document that guides engagement with scientific research. However  this community-sourced science communication comes largely from a knowledgeable public. We conclude with design suggestions for a number of critical problems that we uncovered: addressing the problem of topic newsworthiness and balancing broader participation and rigor.
Moments of Change: Analyzing Peer-Based Cognitive Support in Online Mental Health Forums,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Yada Pruksachatkun  New York University Sachin R. Pendse  Microsoft Research India Amit Sharma  Microsoft Research India,Clinical psychology literature indicates that reframing ir- rational thoughts can help bring positive cognitive change to those suffering from mental distress. Through data from an online mental health forum  we study how these cognitive processes play out in peer-to-peer conversations. Acknowledging the complexity of measuring cognitive change  we first provide an operational definition of a "moment of change" based on sentiment change in online conversations. Using this definition  we propose a predictive model that can identify whether a conversation thread or a post is associated with a moment of cognitive change. Consistent with psychological literature  we find that markers of language associated with sentiment and and affect are the most predictive. Further  cultural differences play an important role: predictive models trained on one country generalize poorly to others. To understand how a moment of change happens  we build a model that explicitly tracks topic and associated sentiment in a forum thread.
#HandsOffMyADA: A Twitter Response to the ADA Education and Reform Act,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Brooke E. Auxier  University of Maryland  College Park Cody L. Buntain  University of Maryland  College Park Paul Jaeger  University of Maryland  College Park Jennifer Golbeck  University of Maryland  College Park Hernisa Kacorri  University of Maryland  College Park,Twitter continues to be used increasingly for communication related advocacy  activism  and social change. This is also the case for the disability community. In light of the recently proposed ADA Education and Reform in the United States  we investigate factors for effectiveness of sharing or retweeting messages about topics affecting the rights of people with disabilities. We perform a multifaceted study of the #HandsOffMyADA campaign against the proposed H.R.620 bill to: (1) explore how communication via Twitter compares to previous disability rights movements; (2) characterize the campaign in terms of hashtags  user groups  and content such as accessible multimedia that contribute to dissemination of campaign messages; (3) identify major themes in tweets and responses  and their variation among user groups; and (4) understand how the disability community mobilized for this campaign compared to previous Twitter initiatives.
Communicating Hurricane Risks: Multi-Method Examination of Risk Imagery Diffusion,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Melissa Bica  University of Colorado Boulder Julie L. Demuth  National Center for Atmospheric Research James E. Dykes  University of Colorado Boulder Leysia Palen  University of Colorado Boulder,Conveying uncertainty in information artifacts is difficult; the challenge only grows as the demand for mass communication through multiple channels expands. In particular  as natural hazards increase with changing global conditions  including hurricanes which threaten coastal areas  we need better means of communicating uncertainty around risks that empower people to make good decisions. We examine how people share and respond to a range of visual representations of risk from authoritative sources during hurricane events. Because these images are now shared widely on social media platforms  Twitter provides the means to study them on a large scale as close to in vivo as possible. Using mixed methods  this study analyzes diffusion of and reactions to forecast and other risk imagery during the highly damaging 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to describe the collective response to visual representations of risk.
Can Children Understand Machine Learning Concepts? The Effect of Uncovering Black Boxes,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Tom Hitron  Interdisciplinary Center Yoav Orlev  Interdisciplinary Center Iddo Yehoshua Wald  Interdisciplinary Center Ariel Shamir  Interdisciplinary Center Hadas Erel  Interdisciplinary Center Oren Zuckerman  Interdisciplinary Center,Machine Learning services are integrated into various aspects of everyday life. Their underlying processes are typically black-boxed to increase ease-of-use. Consequently  children lack the opportunity to explore such processes and develop essential mental models. We present a gesture recognition research platform  designed to support learning from experience by uncovering Machine Learning building blocks: Data Labeling and Evaluation. Children used the platform to perform physical gestures  iterating between sampling and evaluation. Their understanding was tested in a pre/post experimental design  in three conditions: learning activity uncovering Data Labeling only  Evaluation only  or both. Our findings show that both building blocks are imperative to enhance children's understanding of basic Machine Learning concepts. Children were able to apply their new knowledge to everyday life context  including personally meaningful applications. We conclude that children's interaction with uncovered black boxes of Machine Learning contributes to a better understanding of the world around them.
Pyrus: Designing A Collaborative Programming Game to Promote Problem Solving Behaviors,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Joshua Shi  Northwestern University Armaan Shah  Northwestern University Garrett Hedman  Northwestern University Eleanor O'Rourke  Northwestern University,While problem solving is a crucial aspect of programming  few learning opportunities in computer science focus on teaching problem-solving skills like planning. In this paper  we present Pyrus  a collaborative game designed to encourage novices to plan in advance while programming. Through Pyrus  we explore a new approach to designing educational games we call behavior-centered game design  in which designers first identify behaviors that learners should practice to reach desired learning goals and then select game mechanics that incentivize those behaviors. Pyrus leverages game mechanics like a failure condition  distributed resources  and enforced turn-taking to encourage players to plan and collaborate. In a within-subjects user study  we found that pairs of novices spent more time planning and collaborated more equally when solving problems in Pyrus than in pair programming. These findings show that game mechanics can be used to promote desirable learning behaviors like planning in advance  and suggest that our behavior-centered approach to educational game design warrants further study.
HOPE for Computing Education: Towards the Infrastructuring of Support for University-School Partnerships,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Megan Venn-Wycherley  Newcastle University Ahmed Kharrufa  Newcastle University,The state of computing education in the UK is described as "patchy and fragile" with universities tasked to provide further support to schools. However  little guidance exists towards the provision of this support. To explore the development of university-school partnerships  we present findings of an extended educational engagement coordinated by Newcastle University  as part of the national "Create  Learn and Inspire with the micro:bit and the BBC" initiative. Following an action research approach  we explore the experiences of undergraduate students  schoolteachers and an educational broker through the process  including recruitment  content development  and delivery of over 30 computing lessons by nine undergraduates. We identify a number of design considerations towards the development of High Opportunity Progression Ecosystems for the improvement of computing education  such as student identity  workload model and process visibility. We then discuss the potential role of technology in infrastructuring support for university-school partnerships
Practitioners Teaching Data Science in Industry and Academia: Expectations  Workflows  and Challenges,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Sean Kross  University of California  San Diego Philip J. Guo  University of California  San Diego,Data science has been growing in prominence across both academia and industry  but there is still little formal consensus about how to teach it. Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming  we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations  2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code  data  and communication  3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup  finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets  and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world.
Careers in HCI and UX: The Digital Transformation from Craft to Strategy,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Charles B. Kreitzberg  Princeton University Elizabeth Rosenzweig  Bentley University Ben Shneiderman  University of Maryland  College Park Elizabeth F. Churchill  Google Inc. Elizabeth Gerber  Northwestern University,Since its inception in the early 1980's  HCI and UX have sought wider recognition and influence. Now digital transformation  a pervasive shift in the role of information technology  will offer both practitioners and researchers far more influential roles in organizations. This shift  which is taking place in industry  education and government is part of a larger shift to a global  digitally connected society. This panel builds on the theme of CHI'19 – Weaving the Threads - through its focus on how HCI/UX  research and practice will be integrated as organizations transform into digitally-driven entities. The panel brings together thought leaders with backgrounds in both academia and industry. With extensive audience participation  we will explore the implications of digital transformation on the roles of HCI/UX  the challenges  and the new skills needed to support a culture change and collaborate with a wider range of stakeholders. It is our hope that this panel can become a jumping off point for future work  built on our belief that HCI/UX are vital drivers of new technologies  and of beneficial societal transformations. Through national agencies and  perhaps in time  becoming part of the UN's Sustainable Development Agenda  would position HCI/UX to fulfill its role as a key driver of both business and social transformation.
Eye Tracking Methodology in Screen-based Usability Testing,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Argyll 3 CROWNE,Lin Wang  U.S. Census Bureau,Eye tracking is an important tool in usability testing of a screen-based user interface. Though eye tracking has been used in usability testing for quite a while  challenges remain. For example  how to accurately calibrate gaze point? How to interpret a scan pattern? In this tutorial  we will introduce the basics of the human oculomotor system  the role of eye tracking in cognition  eye tracking recording techniques  and data analysis methods. Upon the completion of this tutorial  students will have a basic understanding of physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying eye tracking  data collection techniques  and data analysis methods.
Care and Design: An Ethnography of Mutual Recognition in the Context of Advanced Dementia,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Sarah Foley  University College Cork Nadia Pantidi  University College Cork John McCarthy  University College Cork,While there have been considerable developments in designing for dementia within HCI  there is still a lack of empirical understanding of the experience of people with advanced dementia and the ways in which design can support and enrich their lives. In this paper  we present our findings from a long-term ethnographic study  which aimed to gain an understanding of their lived experience and inform design practices for and with people with advanced dementia in residential care. We present our findings using the social theory of recognition as an analytic lens to account for recognition in practice and its challenges in care and research. We discuss how we  as the HCI community  can pragmatically engage with people with advanced dementia and propose a set of considerations for those who wish to design for and with the values of recognition theory to promote collaboration  agency and social identity in advanced dementia care.
Position Exchange Workshops: A Method to Design for Each Other in Families,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Diego Muñoz  Queensland University of Technology Bernd Ploderer  Queensland University of Technology Margot Brereton  Queensland University of Technology,Existing methods for researching and designing to support relationships between parents and their adult children tend to lead to designs that respect the differences between them. We conducted 14 Position Exchange Workshops with parents and their adult children  where the child has left home in recent years  aiming to explicate and confront their positions in creative and supportive ways. We designed three co-design methods (Card Sort for Me & You  Would I Lie to You? and A Magic Machine for You) to support participants to explore  understand  empathize  and design for each other. The findings show that the methods facilitated understanding  renegotiating  and reimagining their current positions. We discuss how positions can help consider both perspectives in the design process. This paper seeks to contribute (1) how the notion of positions enables generating understandings of the relationship  and (2) a set of methods influenced by position exchange  empathy  and playful engagement that help explore human relationships.
Co-Design Beyond Words: 'Moments of Interaction' with Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Cara Wilson  Queensland University of Technology Margot Brereton  Queensland University of Technology Bernd Ploderer  Queensland University of Technology Laurianne Sitbon  Queensland University of Technology,Existing co-design methods support verbal children on the autism spectrum in the design process  while their minimally-verbal peers are overlooked. We describe Co-Design Beyond Words (CDBW)  an approach which merges existing co-design methods with practice-based methods from Speech and Language Therapy which are child-led and interests-based. These emphasise the rich detail that can be conveyed in the moment  through recognising occurrences of  for example  Joint Attention  Turn Taking and Imitation. We worked in an autism-specific primary school over 20 weeks with ten children  aged 5 to 8. We co-designed a playful prototype  the TangiBall  using the three iterative phases of CDBW; the Foundation Phase (preparation for interaction)  the Interaction Phase (designing-and-reflecting in the moment) and the Reflection Phase (reflection-on-action). We contribute a novel co-design approach and present moments of interaction  the micro instances in design in which minimally-verbal children on the spectrum can convey meaning beyond words  through their actions  interactions  and attentional foci. These moments of interaction provide design insight  shape design direction  and reveal unique strengths  interests  and abilities.
Developing Accessible Services: Understanding Current Knowledge and Areas for Future Support,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Michael Crabb  University of Dundee Michael Heron  Robert Gordon University Rhianne Jones  BBC Research and Development Mike Armstrong  BBC Research and Development Hayley Reid  FinancialForce Amy Wilson  Robert Gordon University,When creating digital artefacts  it is important to ensure that the product being made is accessible to as much of the population as is possible. Many guidelines and supporting tools exist to assist reaching this goal. However  little is known about developers' understanding of accessible practice and the methods that are used to implement this. We present findings from an accessibility design workshop that was carried out with a mixture of 197 developers and digital technology students. We discuss perceptions of accessibility  techniques that are used when designing accessible products  and what areas of accessibility development participants believed were important. We show that there are gaps in the knowledge needed to develop accessible products despite the effort to promote accessible design. Our participants are themselves aware of where these gaps are and have suggested a number of areas where tools  techniques and guidance would improve their practice.
Human-Computer Insurrection: Notes on an Anarchist HCI,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Os Keyes  University of Washington Josephine Hoy  University of Washington Margaret Drouhard  University of Washington,The HCI community has worked to expand and improve our consideration of the societal implications of our work and our corresponding responsibilities. Despite this increased engagement  HCI continues to lack an explicitly articulated politic  which we argue re-inscribes and amplifies systemic oppression. In this paper  we set out an explicit political vision of an HCI grounded in emancipatory autonomy—an anarchist HCI  aimed at dismantling all oppressive systems by mandating suspicion of and a reckoning with imbalanced distributions of power. We outline some of the principles and accountability mechanisms that constitute an anarchist HCI. We offer a potential framework for radically reorienting the field towards creating prefigurative counterpower—systems and spaces that exemplify the world we wish to see  as we go about building the revolution in increment.
Getting There: Barriers and Facilitators to Transportation Access in Underserved Communities ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Tawanna R. Dillahunt  University of Michigan Tiffany C. Veinot  University of Michigan,Advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) offer new opportunities for addressing transportation needs; however  past research suggests that opportunities are not equally shared by millions of low-income Americans. We draw from four empirical studies and two case studies to contribute descriptions of the 11 everyday transportation models currently used by residents of low-income and underserved communities to enhance their access to health-enhancing resources. These models fell into personal  private  public  and interpersonal categories. We contribute insights regarding the following barriers and facilitators associated with these models: (1) affordability; (2) individual capabilities; (3) interpersonal trust  care and/or reciprocity; (4) trust in technology; (5) service availability/eligibility; (6) spatial and temporal matches; (7) match between transportation mode and physical needs; (8) service reliability and quality; and (9) infrastructure access. To address these barriers and build on these facilitators  we contribute six supportive policy and design principles. Operationalizing these principles  we propose four new ICT-enhanced models: (1) smart jitneys; (2) generalized  favor based models; (3) expanded resource pooling; and (4) transportation clubs. The focus of these models on socio-technical integration with current capabilities and resources holds promise for enhancing access to jobs  food  and health care for residents of low-income communities.
Infrastructural Inaccessibility: Tech Entrepreneurs in Occupied Palestine ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Pernille Bjørn  University of Copenhagen & University of Washington Nina Boulus-Rodje  Roskilde University,In this article  we examine the fundamental and taken-for-granted infrastructures that make tech entrepreneurship possible. We report from a longitudinal ethnographic study of tech entrepreneurs situated in occupied Palestine. By investigating this polar case of tech entrepreneurship  we identify critical infrastructures that are otherwise invisible and go unnoticed. We propose infrastructural accessibility as a method to identify available and absent infrastructures in concrete trans-local situations. Infrastructural accessibility leads us to identify multiple dimensions of critical infrastructures necessary for the success of tech startups. This includes infrastructures related to location  community  funding  digital platforms  politics  and history. Our study shows how these multiple dimensions of infrastructural accessibility shape the everyday practices of tech entrepreneurs. Furthermore  our study reveals how Palestinian tech entrepreneurship is characterized by infrastructural inaccessibility due to missing infrastructures related to mobility  legal frameworks  payment gateways  and mobile Internet. Infrastructural inaccessibility seriously limits tech entrepreneurs' potential to succeed in creating a long-term sustainable tech industry.
Gabber: Supporting Voice in Participatory Qualitative Practices,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Jay Rainey  Newcastle University Kyle Montague  Newcastle University Pamela Briggs  Northumbria University Robert Anderson  Newcastle University Thomas Nappey  Newcastle University Patrick Olivier  Monash University,We describe the iterative design  development and learning process we undertook to produce Gabber  a digital platform that aims to support distributed capture of spoken interviews and discussions  and their qualitative analysis. Our aim is to reduce both expertise and cost barriers associated with existing technologies  making the process more inclusive. Gabber structures distributed audio data capture  facilitates participatory sensemaking  and supports collaborative reuse of audio. We describe our design and development journey across three distinct field trials over a two-year period. Reflecting on the iterative design process  we offer insights into the challenges faced by non-experts throughout their qualitative practices  and provide guidance for researchers designing systems to support engagement in these practices.
Socio-technical Dynamics: Cooperation of Emergent and Established Organisations in Crises and Disasters,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Daniel Auferbauer  AIT Austrian Institute of Technology Hilda Tellioğlu  TU Wien,Increasing ubiquitousness of information and communication technology exerts influence on crisis and disaster management. New media enable citizens to rapidly self-organise in emergent groups. Theoretical framing of their interactions with established organisations is lacking. To address this  we conduct a thematic analysis on qualitative data from the European migration crisis of 2015. We draw on context-rich material from both emergent groups and established organisation. To represent our findings  we introduce the notion of socio-technical dynamics. We derive implications for computer supported cooperative work in crises and disasters. These insights contribute to the efficient involvement of emergent groups in established systems.
Should I Agree? Delegating Consent Decisions Beyond the Individual,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Bettina Nissen  University of Edinburgh Victoria Neumann  Lancaster University Mateusz Mikusz  Lancaster University Rory Gianni  The University of Edinburgh Sarah Clinch  University of Manchester Chris Speed  University of Edinburgh Nigel Davies  Lancaster University,Obtaining meaningful user consent is increasingly problematic in a world of numerous  heterogeneous digital services. Current approaches (e.g. agreeing to Terms and Conditions) are rooted in the idea of individual control despite growing evidence that users do not (or cannot) exercise such control in informed ways. We consider an alternative approach whereby users can opt to delegate consent decisions to an ecosystem of third-parties including friends  experts  groups and AI entities. We present the results of a study that used a technology probe at a large festival to explore initial public responses to this reframing -- focusing on when and to whom users would delegate such decisions. The results reveal substantial public interest in delegating consent and identify differing preferences depending on the privacy context  highlighting the need for alternative decision mechanisms beyond the current focus on individual choice.
When Do People Trust Their Social Groups?,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Xiao Ma  Jacobs Institute  Cornell Tech & Facebook Justin Cheng  Facebook Shankar Iyer  Facebook Mor Naaman  Jacobs Institute  Cornell Tech,Trust facilitates cooperation and supports positive outcomes in social groups  including member satisfaction  information sharing  and task performance. Extensive prior research has examined individuals' general propensity to trust  as well as the factors that contribute to their trust in specific groups. Here  we build on past work to present a comprehensive framework for predicting trust in groups. By surveying 6 383 Facebook Groups users about their trust attitudes and examining aggregated behavioral and demographic data for these individuals  we show that (1) an individual's propensity to trust is associated with how they trust their groups  (2) smaller  closed  older  more exclusive  or more homogeneous groups are trusted more  and (3) a group's overall friendship-network structure and an individual's position within that structure can also predict trust. Last  we demonstrate how group trust predicts outcomes at both individual and group level such as the formation of new friendship ties.

Prototyping Transparent and Flexible Electrochromic Displays,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Markus Löchtefeld  Aalborg University Walther Jensen  Aalborg University Heiko Müller  University of Lapland Ashley Colley  University of Lapland,This course is a hands-on introduction to the fabrication of flexible  transparent free-form displays based on electrochromism for an audience with a variety of backgrounds  including artists and designers with no prior knowledge of physical prototyping. Besides prototyping using screen printing or ink-jet printing of electrochromic ink and an easy assembly process  participants will learn essentials for designing and prototyping electrochromic displays.
Modeling Mobile Interface Tappability Using Crowdsourcing and Deep Learning,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Amanda Swearngin  University of Washington & Google Research Yang Li  Google Research,Tapping is an immensely important gesture in mobile touchscreen interfaces  yet people still frequently are required to learn which elements are tappable through trial and error. Predicting human behavior for this everyday gesture can help mobile app designers understand an important aspect of the usability of their apps without having to run a user study. In this paper  we present an approach for modeling tappability of mobile interfaces at scale. We conducted large-scale data collection of interface tappability over a rich set of mobile apps using crowdsourcing and computationally investigated a variety of signifiers that people use to distinguish tappable versus not-tappable elements. Based on the dataset  we developed and trained a deep neural network that predicts how likely a user will perceive an interface element as tappable versus not tappable. Using the trained tappability model  we developed TapShoe  a tool that automatically diagnoses mismatches between the tappability of each element as perceived by a human user---predicted by our model  and the intended or actual tappable state of the element specified by the developer or designer. Our model achieved reasonable accuracy: mean precision 90.2% and recall 87.0%  in matching human perception on identifying tappable UI elements. The tappability model and TapShoe were well received by designers via an informal evaluation with 7 professional interaction designers.
TORC: A Virtual Reality Controller for In-Hand High-Dexterity Finger Interaction,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Jaeyeon Lee  Microsoft Research & Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Mike Sinclair  Microsoft Mar Gonzalez-Franco  Microsoft Research Eyal Ofek  Microsoft Research Christian Holz  Microsoft Research,Recent hand-held controllers have explored a variety of haptic feedback sensations for users in virtual reality by producing both kinesthetic and cutaneous feedback from virtual objects. These controllers are grounded to the user's hand and can only manipulate objects through arm and wrist motions  not using the dexterity of their fingers as they would in real life. In this paper  we present TORC  a rigid haptic controller that renders virtual object characteristics and behaviors such as texture and compliance. Users hold and squeeze TORC using their thumb and two fingers and interact with virtual objects by sliding their thumb on TORC's trackpad. During the interaction  vibrotactile motors produce sensations to each finger that represent the haptic feel of squeezing  shearing or turning an object. Our evaluation showed that using TORC  participants could manipulate virtual objects more precisely (e.g.  position and rotate objects in 3D) than when using a conventional VR controller.
The Performative Mirror Space,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Rachel Jacobs  University of Nottingham Holger Schnädelbach  University of Nottingham Nils Jäger  University of Loughborough Silvia Leal  Independent Creative Robin Shackford  Independent Creative Steve Benford  University of Nottingham Roma Patel  University of Nottingham,Interactive mirrors  typically combining semi-transparent mirrors  digital screens and interaction mechanisms have been developed for a variety of application areas. Drawing on existing techniques to create interactive mirror spaces  we investigated their performative qualities through artistic discovery and collaborative prototyping. We document a linked set of design explorations and two public  site-specific experiences that brought together artists  communities  and HCI researchers. We illustrate the abstracted interactive mirror space that practitioners in the performance art  theatre and museum sectors can work with. In turn  we also discuss six performative design strategies concerning the use of physical context  movement and narrative that HCI researchers who wish to deploy interactive mirrors in more mainstream settings need to consider.
Design Guideline for Developing Safe Systems that Apply Electricity to the Human Body ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Michinari Kono  The University of Tokyo Takumi Takahashi  The University of Tokyo Hiromi Nakamura  AIST Takashi Miyaki  The University of Tokyo Jun Rekimoto  Sony CSL & The University of Tokyo,The human body has unique electrical characteristics. These characteristics have been investigated in various studies in human-computer interaction (HCI) and related research fields. Such studies include applications for using the body as a conductive lead for transmission or electric field sensing and activating human muscles or organs. However  electricity is not completely safe for the human body; therefore  to avoid harming users  careful consideration is essential when developing such devices. The knowledge required for such consideration is spread throughout a large number research fields  and it can be difficult for researchers in the HCI field to comprehend all of them. The purpose of this article is to support researchers in developing systems that apply electricity to the human body and to serve as a basis for further research. This article reviews previous research pertaining to HCI in which users come into contact with electricity. In addition  considerations of how and where this type of research can be expanded  along with guidelines grounded in other fields for designing systems safely and addressing ethical concerns  are presented. An understanding of the field and of the related safety issues will enhance the understanding of limitations and potential and can clarify the design space.
Improving Fairness in Machine Learning Systems: What Do Industry Practitioners Need?,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Kenneth Holstein  Carnegie Mellon University Jennifer Wortman Vaughan  Microsoft Research Hal Daumé  Microsoft Research & University of Maryland Miro Dudik  Microsoft Research Hanna Wallach  Microsoft Research,The potential for machine learning (ML) systems to amplify social inequities and unfairness is receiving increasing popular and academic attention. A surge of recent work has focused on the development of algorithmic tools to assess and mitigate such unfairness. If these tools are to have a positive impact on industry practice  however  it is crucial that their design be informed by an understanding of real-world needs. Through 35 semi-structured interviews and an anonymous survey of 267 ML practitioners  we conduct the first systematic investigation of commercial product teams' challenges and needs for support in developing fairer ML systems. We identify areas of alignment and disconnect between the challenges faced by teams in practice and the solutions proposed in the fair ML research literature. Based on these findings  we highlight directions for future ML and HCI research that will better address practitioners' needs.
A is for Artificial Intelligence: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence Activities on Young Children's Perceptions of Robots,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Randi Williams  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Hae Won Park  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cynthia Breazeal  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,We developed a novel early childhood artificial intelligence (AI) platform  PopBots  where preschool children train and interact with social robots to learn three AI concepts: knowledge-based systems  supervised machine learning  and generative AI. We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then  we analyzed the impact of the activities on children's perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them  but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them  however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.
Understanding the Effect of Accuracy on Trust in Machine Learning Models,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Ming Yin  Purdue University Jennifer Wortman Vaughan  Microsoft Research Hanna Wallach  Microsoft Research,We address a relatively under-explored aspect of human-computer interaction: people's abilities to understand the relationship between a machine learning model's stated performance on held-out data and its expected performance post deployment. We conduct large-scale  randomized human-subject experiments to examine whether laypeople's trust in a model  measured in terms of both the frequency with which they revise their predictions to match those of the model and their self-reported levels of trust in the model  varies depending on the model's stated accuracy on held-out data and on its observed accuracy in practice. We find that people's trust in a model is affected by both its stated accuracy and its observed accuracy  and that the effect of stated accuracy can change depending on the observed accuracy. Our work relates to recent research on interpretable machine learning  but moves beyond the typical focus on model internals  exploring a different component of the machine learning pipeline.
Some Prior(s) Experience Necessary: Templates for Getting Started With Bayesian Analysis,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Chanda Phelan  University of Michigan Jessica Hullman  Northwestern University Matthew Kay  University of Michigan Paul Resnick  University of Michigan,Bayesian statistical analysis has gained attention in recent years  including in HCI. The Bayesian approach has several advantages over traditional statistics  including producing results with more intuitive interpretations. Despite growing interest  few papers in CHI use Bayesian analysis. Existing tools to learn Bayesian statistics require significant time investment  making it difficult to casually explore Bayesian methods. Here  we present a tool that lowers the barrier to exploration: a set of R code templates that guide Bayesian novices through their first analysis. The templates are tailored to CHI  supporting analyses found to be most common in recent CHI papers. In a user study  we found that the templates were easy to understand and use. However  we found that participants without a statistical background were not confident in their use. Together our contributions provide a concise analysis tool and empirical results for understanding and addressing barriers to using Bayesian analysis in HCI.

Paragraph-based Faded Text Facilitates Reading Comprehension,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Forth,Jumpei Kobayashi  Dai Nippon Printing Co.  Ltd. & Future University Hakodate Toshio Kawashima  Future University Hakodate,We propose a new text layout that facilitates reading comprehension. By sequentially fading out characters sentence-by-sentence from the beginning of each paragraph  we highlight the paragraph structure of the entire text and the relative positions of the sentences. To evaluate the effectiveness of the paragraph-based faded text in a reading comprehension  we measure the comprehension  eye movements  and recognition for both the proposed method and a conventional standard method. In the proposed method  rates of correct answers to text comprehension questions are improved. Moreover  the proposed method leads to slower reading speeds and better recognition rates for the first sentences of paragraphs  which are displayed in a relatively thicker mode. With the paragraph-based faded text  the reader is naturally facilitated to pay attention to the first sentence of each paragraph  suggesting that this reading style could result in a more accurate text comprehension.
Sketching NLP: A Case Study of Exploring the Right Things To Design with Language Intelligence,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Forth,Qian Yang  Carnegie Mellon University Justin Cranshaw  Microsoft Research Saleema Amershi  Microsoft Research Shamsi Iqbal  Microsoft Research Jaime Teevan  Microsoft Research,This paper investigates how to sketch NLP-powered user experiences. Sketching is a cornerstone of design innovation. When sketching  designers rapidly experiment with a number of abstract ideas using simple  tangible instruments such as drawings and paper prototypes. Sketching NLP-powered experiences  however  presents challenges  i.e. How to visualize abstract language interaction? How to ideate a broad range of technically feasible intelligent functionalities? As a first step towards understanding these challenges  we present a first-person account of our sketching process when designing intelligent writing assistance. We detail the challenges we encountered and emergent solutions  such as a new format of wireframe for sketching language interactions and a new wizard-of-oz-based NLP rapid prototyping method. Drawing on these findings  we discuss the importance of abstraction in sketching and other implications.
Multi-Modal Approaches for Post-Editing Machine Translation,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Forth,Nico Herbig  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus Santanu Pal  Saarland University Josef van Genabith  Saarland University Antonio Krüger  German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)  Saarland Informatics Campus,Current advances in machine translation increase the need for translators to switch from traditional translation to post-editing (PE) of machine-translated text  a process that saves time and improves quality. This affects the design of translation interfaces  as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Our results of an elicitation study with professional translators indicate that a combination of pen  touch  and speech could well support common PE tasks  and received high subjective ratings by our participants. Therefore  we argue that future translation environment research should focus more strongly on these modalities in addition to mouse- and keyboard-based approaches. On the other hand  eye tracking and gesture modalities seem less important. An additional interview regarding interface design revealed that most translators would also see value in automatically receiving additional resources when a high cognitive load is detected during PE.
Cultivating Care through Ambiguity: Lessons from a Service Learning Course,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Forth,Samar Sabie  Cornell University Tapan Parikh  Cornell University,Given the focus of professional graduate ICT programs on technical and managerial skills  pedagogical engagement with external organizations tends to be transactional and artifact-centered. This inhibits the students' ability to understand social  technical and ethical issues in context  or to develop affective relationships with users and other stakeholders. To address this  we designed a service learning course that partnered students with non-profit organizations to help with their technology challenges. The service project was deliberately left open-ended to force students (and partners) to tackle important questions around project scoping and impact. By drawing parallels to soil care practices  we explore how "care time" emerged in this context  and how the incorporation of ambiguity galvanized students  community  and faculty to make time to navigate it. This led to non-tangible yet vital outcomes such as overcoming social limitations  building symbiotic relationships  and enacting acts of care necessary for more ethical orchestration of technology.
Privacy and Security Considerations For Digital Technology Use in Elementary Schools,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Gala,Priya C. Kumar  University of Maryland  College Park Marshini Chetty  Princeton University Tamara L. Clegg  University of Maryland  College Park Jessica Vitak  University of Maryland  College Park,Elementary school educators increasingly use digital technologies to teach students  manage classrooms  and complete everyday tasks. Prior work has considered the educational and pedagogical implications of technology use  but little research has examined how educators consider privacy and security in relation to classroom technology use. To better understand what privacy and security mean to elementary school educators  we conducted nine focus groups with 25 educators across three metropolitan regions in the northeast U.S. Our findings suggest that technology use is an integral part of elementary school classrooms  that educators consider digital privacy and security through the lens of curricular and classroom management goals  and that lessons to teach children about digital privacy and security are rare. Using Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory  we identify design opportunities to help educators integrate privacy and security into decisions about digital technology use and to help children learn about digital privacy and security.
PeerLens: Peer-inspired Interactive Learning Path Planning in Online Question Pool,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Gala,Meng Xia  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Mingfei Sun  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Huan Wei  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Qing Chen  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Yong Wang  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Lei Shi  Beihang University Huamin Qu  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Xiaojuan Ma  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Online question pools like LeetCode provide hands-on exercises of skills and knowledge. However  due to the large volume of questions and the intent of hiding the tested knowledge behind them  many users find it hard to decide where to start or how to proceed based on their goals and performance. To overcome these limitations  we present PeerLens  an interactive visual analysis system that enables peer-inspired learning path planning. PeerLens can recommend a customized  adaptable sequence of practice questions to individual learners  based on the exercise history of other users in a similar learning scenario. We propose a new way to model the learning path by submission types and a novel visual design to facilitate the understanding and planning of the learning path. We conducted a within-subject experiment to assess the efficacy and usefulness of PeerLens in comparison with two baseline systems. Experiment results show that users are more confident in arranging their learning path via PeerLens and find it more informative and intuitive.
Anchored Audio Sampling: A Seamless Method for Exploring Children's Thoughts During Deployment Studies,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Gala,Alexis Hiniker  University of Washington Jon E. Froehlich  University of Washington Mingrui Zhang  University of Washington Erin Beneteau  University of Washington,Many traditional HCI methods  such as surveys and interviews  are of limited value when working with preschoolers. In this paper  we present anchored audio sampling (AAS)  a remote data collection technique for extracting qualitative audio samples during field deployments with young children. AAS offers a developmentally sensitive way of understanding how children make sense of technology and situates their use in the larger context of daily life. AAS is defined by an anchor event  around which audio is collected. A sliding window surrounding this anchor captures both antecedent and ensuing recording  providing the researcher insight into the activities that led up to the event of interest as well as those that followed. We present themes from three deployments that leverage this technique. Based on our experiences using AAS  we have also developed a reusable open-source library for embedding AAS into any Android application.
Voice User Interfaces in Schools: Co-designing for Inclusion with Visually-Impaired and Sighted Pupils,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Gala,Oussama Metatla  University of Bristol Alison Oldfield  University of Bristol Taimur Ahmed  University of Bristol Antonis Vafeas  University of Bristol Sunny Miglani  University of Bristol,Voice user interfaces (VUIs) are increasingly popular  particularly in homes. However  little research has investigated their potential in other settings  such as schools. We investigated how VUIs could support inclusive education  particularly for pupils with visual impairments (VIs). We organised focused discussions with educators at a school  with support staff from local authorities and  through bodystorming  with a class of 27 pupils. We then ran a series of co-design workshops with participants with mixed-visual abilities to design an educational VUI application. This provided insights into challenges faced by pupils with VIs in mainstream schools  and opened a space for educators  sighted and visually impaired pupils to reflect on and design for their shared learning experiences through VUIs. We present scenarios  a design space and an example application that show novel ways of using VUIs for inclusive education. We also reflect on co-designing with mixed-visual-ability groups in this space.
Fast and Precise Touch-Based Text Entry for Head-Mounted Augmented Reality with Variable Occlusion ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Hall 1,John J. Dudley  University of Cambridge Keith Vertanen  Michigan Technological University Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge,We present the VISAR keyboard: an augmented reality (AR) head-mounted display (HMD) system that supports text entry via a virtualised input surface. Users select keys on the virtual keyboard by imitating the process of single-hand typing on a physical touchscreen display. Our system uses a statistical decoder to infer users' intended text and to provide error-tolerant predictions. There is also a high-precision fall-back mechanism to support users in indicating which keys should be unmodified by the auto-correction process. A unique advantage of leveraging the well-established touch input paradigm is that our system enables text entry with minimal visual clutter on the see-through display  thus preserving the user's field-of-view. We iteratively designed and evaluated our system and show that the final iteration of the system supports a mean entry rate of 17.75 wpm with a mean character error rate less than 1%. This performance represents a 19.6% improvement relative to the state-of-the-art baseline investigated: a gaze-then-gesture text entry technique derived from the system keyboard on the Microsoft HoloLens. Finally  we validate that the system is effective in supporting text entry in a fully mobile usage scenario likely to be encountered in industrial applications of AR HMDs.
BotMap: Non-Visual Panning and Zooming with an Actuated Tabletop Tangible Interface ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Julie Ducasse  CNRS & University of Toulouse Marc J-M Macé  CNRS & University of Toulouse Bernard Oriola  CNRS & University of Toulouse Christophe Jouffrais  CNRS,The development of novel shape-changing or actuated tabletop tangible interfaces opens new perspectives for the design of physical and dynamic maps  especially for visually impaired (VI) users. Such maps would allow non-visual haptic exploration with advanced functions  such as panning and zooming. In this study  we designed an actuated tangible tabletop interface  called BotMap  allowing the exploration of geographic data through non-visual panning and zooming. In BotMap  small robots represent landmarks and move to their correct position whenever the map is refreshed. Users can interact with the robots to retrieve the names of the landmarks they represent. We designed two interfaces  named Keyboard and Sliders  which enable users to pan and zoom. Two evaluations were conducted with  respectively  ten blindfolded and eight VI participants. Results show that both interfaces were usable  with a slight advantage for the Keyboard interface in terms of navigation performance and map comprehension  and that  even when many panning and zooming operations were required  VI participants were able to understand the maps. Most participants managed to accurately reconstruct maps after exploration. Finally  we observed three VI people using the system and performing a classical task consisting in finding the more appropriate itinerary for a journey.
Personal Mobile Messaging in Context: Chat Augmentations for Expressiveness and Awareness ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Daniel Buschek  LMU Munich Mariam Hassib  Group for Media Informatics Florian Alt  Bundeswehr University Munich,Mobile text messaging is one of the most important communication channels today  but it suffers from lack of expressiveness  context and emotional awareness  compared to face-to-face communication. We address this problem by augmenting text messaging with information about users and contexts. We present and reflect on lessons learned from three field studies  in which we deployed augmentation concepts as prototype chat apps in users' daily lives. We studied (1) subtly conveying context via dynamic font personalisation (TapScript)  (2) integrating and sharing physiological data - namely heart rate -–implicitly or explicitly (HeartChat) and (3) automatic annotation of various context cues: music  distance  weather and activities (ContextChat). Based on our studies  we discuss chat augmentation with respect to privacy concerns  understandability  connectedness and inferring context in addition to methodological lessons learned. Finally  we propose a design space for chat augmentation to guide future research  and conclude with practical design implications.
PlaneVR: Social Acceptability of Virtual Reality for Aeroplane Passengers,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Julie Williamson  University of Glasgow Mark McGill  University of Glasgow Khari Outram  University of Glasgow,Virtual reality (VR) headsets allow wearers to escape their physical surroundings  immersing themselves in a virtual world. Although escape may not be realistic or acceptable in many everyday situations  air travel is one context where early adoption of VR could be very attractive. While travelling  passengers are seated in restricted spaces for long durations  reliant on limited seat-back displays or mobile devices. This paper explores the social acceptability and usability of VR for in-flight entertainment. In an initial survey  we captured respondents' attitudes towards the social acceptability of VR headsets during air travel. Based on the survey results  we developed a VR in-flight entertainment prototype and evaluated this in a focus group study. Our results discuss methods for improving the acceptability of VR in-flight  including using mixed reality to help users transition between virtual and physical environments and supporting interruption from other co-located people.
Understanding the Shared Experience of Runners and Spectators in Long-Distance Running Events,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Tao Bi  University College London Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze  University College London Aneesha Singh  University College London Enrico Costanza  University College London,Increasingly popular  long-distance running events (LDRE) attract not just runners but an exponentially increasing number of spectators. Due to the long duration and broad geographic spread of such events  interactions between them are limited to brief moments when runners (R) pass by their supporting spectators (S). Current technology is limited in its potential for supporting interactions and mainly measures and displays basic running information to spectators who passively consume it. In this paper  we conducted qualitative studies for an in-depth understanding of the R&S' shared experience during LDRE and how technology can enrich this experience. We propose a two-layer DyPECS framework  highlighting the rich dynamics of the R&S multi-faceted running journey and of their micro-encounters. DyPECS is enriched by the findings from our in depth qualitative studies. We finally present design implications for the multi-facet co-experience of R&S during LDRE.
Effects of Locomotion and Visual Overview on Spatial Memory when Interacting with Wall Displays,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Yvonne Jansen  CNRS – Sorbonne Université Jonas Schjerlund  University of Copenhagen Kasper Hornbæk  University of Copenhagen,Wall displays support people in interacting with large information spaces in two ways: On the one hand  the physical space in front of such displays enables them to navigate information spaces physically. On the other hand  the visual overview of the information space on the display may promote the formation of spatial memory; from studies of desktop computers we know this can boost performance. However  it remains unclear how the benefits of locomotion and overviews relate and whether one is more important than the other. We study this question through a wall display adaptation of the classic Data Mountain system to separate the effects of locomotion and visual overview. Our findings suggest that overview improves recall and that the combination of overview and locomotion outperforms all other combinations of factors.
Peripheral Notifications in Large Displays: Effects of Feature Combination and Task Interference,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Aristides Mairena  University of Saskatchewan Carl Gutwin  University of Saskatchewan Andy Cockburn  University of Canterbury,Visual notifications are integral to interactive computing systems. With large displays  however  much of the content is in the user's visual periphery  where human capacity to notice visual effects is diminished. One design strategy for enhancing noticeability is to combine visual features  such as motion and colour. Yet little is known about how feature combinations affect noticeability across the visual field  or about how peripheral noticeability changes when a user's primary task involves the same visual features as the notification. We addressed these questions by conducting two studies. Results of the first study showed that noticeability of feature combinations were approximately equal to the better of the individual features. Results of the second study suggest that there can be interference between the features of primary tasks and the visual features in the notifications. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how visual features operate when used as peripheral notifications.
Digital Housekeeping  Gender and Domestic Work,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Island A CROWNE,Ana Luísa Sertã  Birkbeck  University of London Houda El Mimouni  Drexel University Louise Barkhuus  IT University of Copenhagen Rosie Cox  Birkbeck  University of London Jennifer Rode  University College London,This SIG meeting will examine the domestic technologies and routines of diverse households as well as the role of gender in the use and maintenance of these technologies. Our aim is to bring together domestic technology experts and social scientists who study the domestic environment across a range of socio-economic groups to discuss the present and the future of domestic technologies  including their impacts on the lives of those who are often unvoiced  such as paid domestic workers.
Communicating your Research to the Public and the Press,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Island B CROWNE,Helen Pilcher,Researchers are increasingly called upon to communicate with non-specialist audiences  but it can be difficult to communicate complex scientific topics in a way that makes them accessible and engaging to people outside the field. Further  interacting with the media can be daunting and frustrating and researchers frequently comment on how their work is misrepresented in the popular press. This course aims to give participants the skills needed to interact confidently with the media and to non-specialists  and get their key messages across.
The Channel Matters: Self-disclosure  Reciprocity and Social Support in Online Cancer Support Groups,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Lomond,Diyi Yang  Carnegie Mellon University Zheng Yao  Carnegie Mellon University Joseph Seering  Carnegie Mellon University Robert E. Kraut  Carnegie Mellon University,People with health concerns go to online health support groups to obtain help and advice. To do so  they frequently disclose personal details  many times in public. Although research in non-health settings suggests that people self-disclose less in public than in private  this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. Our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members' self-disclosure in an online cancer support group  and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. By automatically measuring people's self-disclosure at scale  we found that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. Although one's self-disclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide support  these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. These channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange  while the private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work.
Measuring and Understanding Photo Sharing Experiences in Social Virtual Reality,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Lomond,Jie Li  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica Yiping Kong  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) Thomas Röggla  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) Francesca De Simone  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) Swamy Ananthanarayan  University of Oldenburg Huib de Ridder  Delft University of Technology Abdallah El Ali  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) Pablo Cesar  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) and Delft University of Technology,Millions of photos are shared online daily  but the richness of interaction compared with face-to-face (F2F) sharing is still missing. While this may change with social Virtual Reality (socialVR)  we still lack tools to measure such immersive and interactive experiences. In this paper  we investigate photo sharing experiences in immersive environments  focusing on socialVR. Running context mapping (N=10)  an expert creative session (N=6)  and an online experience clustering questionnaire (N=20)  we develop and statistically evaluate a questionnaire to measure photo sharing experiences. We then ran a controlled  within-subject study (N=26 pairs) to compare photo sharing under F2F  Skype  and Facebook Spaces. Using interviews  audio analysis  and our questionnaire  we found that socialVR can closely approximate F2F sharing. We contribute empirical findings on the immersiveness differences between digital communication media  and propose a socialVR questionnaire that can in the future generalize beyond photo sharing.
Managing Multimorbidity: Identifying Design Requirements for a Digital Self-Management Tool to Support Older Adults with Multiple Chronic Conditions,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Lomond,Julie Doyle  Dundalk Institute of Technology Emma Murphy  Trinity College Dublin Janneke Kuiper  Vrije Universiteit Brussel Suzanne Smith  Dundalk Institute of Technology Caoimhe Hannigan  Trinity College Dublin An Jacobs  Vrije Universiteit Brussel John Dinsmore  Trinity College Dublin,Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (multimorbidity) face complex self-management routines  including symptom monitoring  managing multiple medications  coordinating healthcare visits  communicating with multiple healthcare providers and processing and managing potentially conflicting advice on conditions. While much research exists on single disease management  little  if any research has explored the topic of technology to support those with multimorbidity  particularly older adults  to self-manage with support from a care network. This paper describes a large qualitative study with 125 participants  including older adults with multimorbidity and those who care for them  across two European countries. Key findings related to the: impact of multimorbidity  complexities involved in self-management  motivators and barriers to self-management  sources of support and poor communication as a barrier to care coordination. We present important concepts and design features for a digital health system that aim to address requirements derived from this study.
Face and Ecological Validity in Simulations: Lessons from Search-and-Rescue HRI,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 11:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 12:20,Lomond,Lorin Dole  Cornell Tech Wendy Ju  Cornell Tech,In fields where in situ performance cannot be measured  ecological validity is difficult to estimate. Drawing on theory from social psychology and virtual reality  we argue that face validity can be a useful proxy for ecological validity. We provide illustrative examples of this relationship from work in search-and-rescue HRI  and conclude with some practical guidelines for the construction of immersive simulations in general.

"Everything's the Phone": Understanding the Phone's Supercharged Role in Parent-Teen Relationships,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Katie Davis  University of Washington Anja Dinhopl  Laboratory for Intelligent Systems in Tourism Alexis Hiniker  University of Washington,Through focus groups (n=61) and surveys (n=2 083) of parents and teens  we investigated how parents and their teen children experience their own and each other's phone use in the context of parent-teen relationships. Both expressed a lack of agency in their own and each other's phone use  feeling overly reliant on their own phone and displaced by the other's phone. In a classic example of the fundamental attribution error  each party placed primary blame on the other  and rationalized their own behavior with legitimizing excuses. We present a conceptual model showing how parents' and teens' relationships to their phones and perceptions of each other's phone use are inextricably linked  and how  together  they contribute to parent-teen tensions and disconnections. We use the model to consider how the phone might play a less highly charged role in family life and contribute to positive connections between parents and their teen children.
"Everyone Brings Their Grain of Salt": Designing for Low-Literate Parental Engagement with a Mobile Literacy Technology in Côte d'Ivoire,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Michael A. Madaio  Carnegie Mellon University Fabrice Tanoh  Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny Axel Blahoua Seri  Institut de la Dignité et des Droits Humains Kaja Jasinska  University of Delaware Amy Ogan  Carnegie Mellon University,Significant research has demonstrated the crucial role that parents play in supporting the development of children's literacy  but in contexts where adults may lack sufficient literacy in the target language  it is not clear how to most effectively scaffold parental support for children's literacy. Prior work has designed technologies to teach children literacy directly  but this work has not focused on designing for low-literate parents  particularly for multilingual and developing contexts. In this paper  we describe findings from a qualitative study conducted in several regions of rural Côte d'Ivoire to understand Ivorian parents' beliefs  desires  and preferences for French literacy. We discuss themes that emerged from these interviews  surrounding ideas of trust  collaboration  and culturally-responsive design  and we highlight implications for the design of technology to scaffold low-literate parental support for children's literacy.
A Walk on the Child Side: Investigating Parents' and Children's Experience and Perspective on Mobile Technology for Outdoor Child Independent Mobility,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Michela Ferron  Fondazione Bruno Kessler Chiara Leonardi  Fondazione Bruno Kessler Paolo Massa  Fondazione Bruno Kessler Gianluca Schiavo  Fondazione Bruno Kessler Amy L. Murphy  Fondazione Bruno Kessler Elisabetta Farella  Fondazione Bruno Kessler,Technology increasingly offers parents more and more opportunities to monitor children  reshaping the way control and autonomy are negotiated within families. This paper investigates the views of parents and primary school children on mobile technology designed to support child independent mobility in the context of the local walking school buses. Based on a school-year long field study  we report findings on children's and parents' experience with proximity detection devices. The results provide insights into how the parents and children accepted and socially appropriated the technology into the walking school bus activity  shedding light on the way they understand and conceptualize a technology that collects data on children's proximity to the volunteers' smartphone. We discuss parents' needs and concerns toward monitoring technologies and the related challenges in terms of trust-control balance. These insights are elaborated to inform the future design of technology for child independent mobility.
The "Comadre" Project: An Asset-Based Design Approach to Connecting Low-Income Latinx Families to Out-of-School Learning Opportunities,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Alexander Cho  University of California  Irvine Roxana G. Herrera  University of California  Irvine Luis Chaidez  University of California  Irvine Adilene Uriostegui  University of California  Irvine,Participation in out-of-school learning programs has been shown to generate significant academic  social/emotional  and institutional benefits for young learners  and today's wealthy families are disproportionately reaping these benefits. This paper presents the results of an asset-based/human-centered design research process and pilot aimed at connecting low-income families in a Southern California city with local low-cost out-of-school learning opportunities. Based on background research including qualitative interviewing  home visits  technology inventories and use walkthroughs with 40 low-income  majority Latinx families  we created and piloted a free subscription SMS service that automatically pushes bilingual SMS messages with curated information on local low-cost enrichment learning opportunities to low-income families. We framed our human-centered design process through an intersectional  "asset-based approach " which recognizes that marginalized communities have already developed robust  culturally-specific social practices to enable them to navigate the world  seeks to amplify them  and refrains from imposing a top-down or pre-conceived "idea" of intervention.
Seeing with New Eyes: Designing for In-the-Wild Museum Gifting,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Jocelyn Spence  University of Nottingham Benjamin Bedwell  University of Nottingham Michelle Coleman  University of Nottingham Steve Benford  University of Nottingham Boriana Koleva  University of Nottingham Matt Adams  Blast Theory Ju Row Farr  Blast Theory Nick Tandavanitj  Blast Theory Anders Sundnes Løvlie  IT University of Copenhagen,This paper presents the GIFT smartphone app  an artist-led Research through Design project benefitting from a three-day in-the-wild deployment. The app takes as its premise the generative potential of combining the contexts of gifting and museum visits. Visitors explore the museum  searching for objects that would most appeal to the gift-receiver they have in mind  then photographing those objects and adding audio messages for their receivers describing the motivation for their choices. This paper charts the designers' key aim of creating a new frame of mind using voice  and the most striking findings discovered during in-the-wild deployment in a museum -- 'seeing with new eyes' and fostering personal connections. We discuss empathy  motivation  and bottom-up personalisation in the productive space revealed by this combination of contexts. We suggest that this work reveals opportunities for designers of gifting services as well as those working in cultural heritage.
Bookly: An Interactive Everyday Artifact Showing the Time of Physically Accumulated Reading Activity,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Somi Ju  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Kyung-Ryong Lee  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Subin Kim  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Young-Woo Park  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,We introduce Bookly  an interactive artifact that physically represents the accumulated time of users' reading activity through abstract volumetric changes. Bookly accumulates the time of actions (e.g.  picking up and putting down books) that users performed for reading and provides a designated space for the ongoing book being read. The results of our 2-week in-field study with six participants showed that continuous exposure to volumetric changes representing the accumulated time of reading activities helped the users to understand their unsettled reading patterns. Bookly also motivated the users to improve their reading behavior by gradually making reading part of their schedules. Additionally  the definite distinction of the ongoing book improved its visual affordance and accessibility for the users to start reading books. Based on the findings  we confirmed the possibility of making intangible data physical for self-reflection to enhance changes in behaviors that are difficult to perform due to weak motivation.
Design and Plural Heritages: Composing Critical Futures,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Tom Schofield  Newcastle University Daniel Foster Smith  Newcastle University Gönül Bozoglu  Newcastle University Christopher Whitehead  Newcastle University,We make theoretical and methodological contributions to the CHI community by introducing comparisons between contemporary Critical Heritage research and some forms of experimental design practice. Beginning by identifying three key approaches in contemporary heritage research: Critical Heritage  Plural Heritages and Future Heritage we introduce these in turn  while exploring their significance for thinking about design  knowledge and diversity. We discuss our efforts to apply ideas integrating Critical Heritage and design through the adoption of known Research through Design techniques in a research project in Istanbul  Turkey describing the design of our study and how this was productive of sensory and speculative reflection on the past. Finally  we reflect on the usefulness of such methods in developing new interactive technologies in heritage contexts and go on to propose a series of recommendations for a future Critical Heritage Design practice.
Understanding Kinaesthetic Creativity in Dance,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Stacy Hsueh  Univ. Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay Sarah Fdili Alaoui  LRI  Univ. Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay Wendy E. Mackay  Inria & Université Paris-Saclay,Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the body's ability to generate alternate futures in activities such as role-playing in participatory design workshops. This has relevance not only to the design of methods for inspiring creativity but also to the design of systems that promote engaging experiences via bodily interaction. This paper probes this creative process by studying how dancers interact with technology to generate ideas. We developed a series of parameterized interactive visuals and asked dance practitioners to use them in generating movement materials. From our study  we define a taxonomy that comprises different relationships and movement responses dancers form with the visuals. Against this taxonomy  we describe six types of interaction patterns and demonstrate how dance creativity is driven by the ability to shift between these patterns. We then propose a set of interaction design qualities to support kinaesthetic creativity.
The Future of Tangible User Interfaces,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Lars Erik Holmquist  Northumbria University Oren Zuckerman  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Rafael 'Tico' Ballagas  HP Inc. Hiroshi Ishii  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Kimiko Ryokai  University of California  Berkeley Haiyan Zhang  Microsoft Research,Tangible user interfaces have a rich history in HCI research ever since their introduction two decades ago. But what are the practical implications  the commercial potential  and the future of this influential paradigm? This panel starts by looking into the importance of tangible interaction and its current role. It will then draw on the expertise of both the panelists and the audience to speculate about its future and new opportunities for the field. The panelists represent a variety of perspectives from both industry and academia  and includes some of the most well-known innovators in the field. The format builds on the CHI 2006 panel The state of tangible interfaces: projects  studies  and open issues  which shared some of the same organizers.
Intro to the Human Body: Wearability and Human Factors of Wearable Systems,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Lucy E. Dunne  University of Minnesota,The traditional "human" model in human-computer interaction prioritizes the human brain  with physical and sensory interaction as secondary emphases. As wearable technologies proliferate and mature  the user experience and human factors of the rest of the body become increasingly important. This course will provide an overview of the basic foundations of wearability and human factors of wearable systems  from anatomy and physiology to body schema  physiological experience of on-body artifacts  and the ways in which dress affects and communicates identity and social relationships.
Eye Tracking Methodology in Screen-based Usability Testing,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Argyll 3 CROWNE,Lin Wang  U.S. Census Bureau,Eye tracking is an important tool in usability testing of a screen-based user interface. Though eye tracking has been used in usability testing for quite a while  challenges remain. For example  how to accurately calibrate gaze point? How to interpret a scan pattern? In this tutorial  we will introduce the basics of the human oculomotor system  the role of eye tracking in cognition  eye tracking recording techniques  and data analysis methods. Upon the completion of this tutorial  students will have a basic understanding of physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying eye tracking  data collection techniques  and data analysis methods.
Moderation Practices as Emotional Labor in Sustaining Online Communities: The Case of AAPI Identity Work on Reddit,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Bryan Dosono  Syracuse University Bryan Semaan  Syracuse University,We examine how and why Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) moderators on Reddit shape the norms of their online communities through the analytic lens of emotional labor. We conduct interviews with 21 moderators who facilitate identity work discourse in AAPI subreddits and present a thematic analysis of their moderation practices. We report on their challenges to sustaining moderation  which include burning out from volunteer work  navigating hierarchical structures  and balancing unfulfilled expectations. We then describe strategies that moderators employ to manage emotional labor  which involve distancing away from drama  building solidarity from shared struggles  and integrating an ecology of tools for self-organized moderation. We provide recommendations for improving moderation in online communities centered around identity work and discuss implications of emotional labor in the design of Reddit and similar platforms.
Effects of Moderation and Opinion Heterogeneity on Attitude towards the Online Deliberation Experience,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Simon T. Perrault  Yale-NUS College & Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Weiyu Zhang  National University of Singapore,Online deliberation offers a way for citizens to collectively discuss an issue and provide input for policymakers. The overall experience of online deliberation can be affected by multiple factors. We decided to investigate the effects of moderation and opinion heterogeneity on the perceived deliberation experience  by running the first online deliberation experiment in Singapore. Our study took place in three months with three phases. In phase 1  our 2 006 participants answered a survey  that we used to create groups of different opinion heterogeneity. During the second phase  510 participants discussed about the population issue on the online platform we developed. We gathered data on their online deliberation experience during phase 3. We found out that higher levels of moderation negatively impact the experience of deliberation on perceived procedural fairness  validity claim and policy legitimacy; and that high opinion heterogeneity is important in order to get a fair assessment of the deliberation experience.
Rumors and Collective Sensemaking: Managing Ambiguity in an Informal Marketplace,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Priyank Chandra  University of Michigan Joyojeet Pal  University of Michigan,Rumors are an enduring form of communication across socio-cultural landscapes globally. Counter to their typical negative association  rumors play a nuanced role  helping people collectively deal with problems through constructing a representation of an uncertain situation. Drawing on unstructured interviews and participant observation from a technology goods marketplace in Bangalore  India  we study the circulation of rumors related to the government's recent policy of demonetization and entry of online marketplaces and digital wallets  all of which disrupted existing market practices. These rumors emerge as attempts at sensemaking when a community is faced with ambiguity. Through highlighting the relationship of institutional trust with rumors  the paper argues that the study of rumors can help us identify the concerns of a community in the face of differential power relations. Further  rumors are a form of social bonding which help communities make sense of their place in society and shape existing practices.
User Attitudes towards Algorithmic Opacity and Transparency in Online Reviewing Platforms,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Motahhare Eslami  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Kristen Vaccaro  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Min Kyung Lee  Carnegie Mellon University Amit Elazari Bar On  University of California  Berkeley Eric Gilbert  University of Michigan Karrie Karahalios  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Algorithms exert great power in curating online information  yet are often opaque in their operation  and even existence. Since opaque algorithms sometimes make biased or deceptive decisions  many have called for increased transparency. However  little is known about how users perceive and interact with potentially biased and deceptive opaque algorithms. What factors are associated with these perceptions  and how does adding transparency into algorithmic systems change user attitudes? To address these questions  we conducted two studies: 1) an analysis of 242 users' online discussions about the Yelp review filtering algorithm and 2) an interview study with 15 Yelp users disclosing the algorithm's existence via a tool. We found that users question or defend this algorithm and its opacity depending on their engagement with and personal gain from the algorithm. We also found adding transparency into the algorithm changed users' attitudes towards the algorithm: users reported their intention to either write for the algorithm in future reviews or leave the platform.
A Translational Science Model for HCI,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Lucas Colusso  University of Washington Ridley Jones  University of Washington Sean Munson  University of Washington Gary Hsieh  University of Washington,Using scientific discoveries to inform design practice is an important  but difficult  objective in HCI. In this paper  we provide an overview of Translational Science in HCI by triangulating literature related to the research-practice gap with interview data from many parties engaged (or not) in translating HCI knowledge. We propose a model for Translational Science in HCI based on the concept of a continuum to describe how knowledge progresses (or stalls) through multiple steps and translations until it can influence design practice. The model offers a conceptual framework that can be used by researchers and practitioners to visualize and describe the progression of HCI knowledge through a sequence of translations. Additionally  the model may facilitate a precise identification of translational barriers  which allows devising more effective strategies to increase the use of scientific findings in design practice.
Do We Care About Diversity in Human Computer Interaction: A Comprehensive Content Analysis on Diversity Dimensions in Research,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Julia Himmelsbach  AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH Stephanie Schwarz  AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH Cornelia Gerdenitsch  AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH Beatrix Wais-Zechmann  AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH Jan Bobeth  AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH Manfred Tscheligi  University of Salzburg & AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH,In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research  awareness for the relevance of diversity of users is increasing. In this work  we analyze whether the articulated need for more diversity-sensitive research led indeed to a higher consideration of diversity in HCI research. Based on a comprehensive collection of diversity dimensions  we present results of a quantitative content analysis of articles accepted in the Proceedings of the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2006  2011  and 2016. Results demonstrate how many and how intensively diversity dimensions were considered  and moreover highlight those dimensions that have so far received less attention. Uncovering continuous and discontinuous trends across time and differences between subfields of research  we identify research gaps and aim at contributing to a comprehensive understanding of diversity supporting diversity-sensitive research in HCI.
Charting Subtle Interaction in the HCI Literature,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Henning Pohl  University of Copenhagen Andreea Muresan  University of Copenhagen Kasper Hornbæk  University of Copenhagen,Human-computer interaction is replete with ways of talking about qualities of interaction or interfaces  including if they are expressive  rich  fluid  or playful. An example of such a quality is subtle. While this word is frequently used in the literature  we lack a coherent account of what it means to be subtle  how to achieve subtleness in an interface  and what theoretical backing subtleness has. To create such an account  we analyze a sample of 55 publications that use the word subtle. We describe the variants of subtle interaction in the literature  including claimed benefits  empirical approaches  and ethical considerations. Not only does this create a basis for thinking about subtleness as a quality of interaction  it also works to show how to solidify varieties of quality in HCI. We conclude by outlining some open empirical and conceptual questions about subtleness.
Relations are more than Bytes: Re-thinking the Benefits of Smart Services through People and Things,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Claude P. R. Heath  Royal Holloway  University of London Clara Crivellaro  Newcastle University Lizzie Coles-Kemp  Royal Holloway  University of London,Critical approaches to smart technologies have emerged in HCI that question the conditions necessary for smart technologies to benefit people. Smart services rely on a relation of trust and sense of security between people and technology requiring a more expansive definition of security. Using established design methods  we worked with two residents' groups to critically explore and rethink smart services in the home and city. From our data analysis  we derive insights about perceptions and understandings of trust  privacy and security of smart devices  and identify how technological security needs to work in concert with social and relational forms of security for smart services to be effective. We conclude with an orientation for HCI that focuses on designing services for and with smart people and things.
Behavioural Biometrics in VR: Identifying People from Body Motion and Relations in Virtual Reality,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Ken Pfeuffer  Bundeswehr University Munich Matthias J. Geiger  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Sarah Prange  Munich University of Applied Sciences & Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Lukas Mecke  University of Applied Sciences Munich & Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Daniel Buschek  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Florian Alt  Bundeswehr University Munich,Every person is unique  with individual behavioural characteristics: how one moves  coordinates  and uses their body. In this paper we investigate body motion as behavioural biometrics for virtual reality. In particular  we look into which behaviour is suitable to identify a user. This is valuable in situations where multiple people use a virtual reality environment in parallel  for example in the context of authentication or to adapt the VR environment to users' preferences. We present a user study (N=22) where people perform controlled VR tasks (pointing  grabbing  walking  typing)  monitoring their head  hand  and eye motion data over two sessions. These body segments can be arbitrarily combined into body relations  and we found that these movements and their combination lead to characteristic behavioural patterns. We present an extensive analysis of which motion/relation is useful to identify users in which tasks using classification methods. Our findings are beneficial for researchers and practitioners alike who aim to build novel adaptive and secure user interfaces in virtual reality.
The Dissimilarity-Consensus Approach to Agreement Analysis in Gesture Elicitation Studies,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Radu-Daniel Vatavu  University Ştefan cel Mare of Suceava,We introduce the dissimilarity-consensus method  a new approach to computing objective measures of consensus between users' gesture preferences to support data analysis in end-user gesture elicitation studies. Our method models and quantifies the relationship between users' consensus over gesture articulation and numerical measures of gesture dissimilarity  e.g.  Dynamic Time Warping or Hausdorff distances  by employing growth curves and logistic functions. We exemplify our method on 1 312 whole-body gestures elicited from 30 children  ages 3 to 6 years  and we report the first empirical results in the literature on the consensus between whole-body gestures produced by children this young. We provide C# and R software implementations of our method and make our gesture dataset publicly available.
Only one item left? Heuristic Information Trumps Calorie Count When Supporting Healthy Snacking Under Low Self-Control,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Daniel Reinhardt  Julius-Maximilians-Universität Jörn Hurtienne  Julius-Maximilians-Universität,Pursuing the goal of a healthy diet may be challenging  especially when self-control resources are low. Yet many persuasive user interfaces fostering healthy choices are designed for situations with ample self-control  e.g. showing nutritional information to support reflective decision making. In this paper we propose that under low self-control  persuasive user interfaces need to rely on simple heuristic decision making to be successful. We report an experiment that tested this assumption in a 2 (low vs. high self-control) x 2 (calorie vs. heuristic information) design. The results reveal a significant interaction effect. Participants with low self-control resources chose the healthy snack more often when snacks were labelled with heuristic information than when they were labelled with calorie information. Both strategies were about equally successful for participants with high self-control. Exploiting situations of low self-control with heuristic information is a new and promising approach to designing persuasive technology for healthy eating.
Continuous Alertness Assessments: Using EOG Glasses to Unobtrusively Monitor Fatigue Levels In-The-Wild,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Benjamin Tag  Keio University Andrew W. Vargo  The Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics Aman Gupta  Keio University George Chernyshov  Keio University Kai Kunze  Keio University Tilman Dingler  University of Melbourne,As the day progresses  cognitive functions are subject to fluctuations. While the circadian process results in diurnal peaks and drops  the homeostatic process manifests itself in a steady decline of alertness across the day. Awareness of these changes allows the design of proactive recommender and warning systems  which encourage demanding tasks during periods of high alertness and flag accident-prone activities in low alertness states. In contrast to conventional alertness assessments  which are often limited to lab conditions  bulky hardware  or interruptive self-assessments  we base our approach on eye blink frequency data known to directly relate to fatigue levels. Using electrooculography sensors integrated into regular glasses' frames  we recorded the eye movements of 16 participants over the course of two weeks in-the-wild and built a robust model of diurnal alertness changes. Our proposed method allows for unobtrusive and continuous monitoring of alertness levels throughout the day.
Chatbots  Humbots  and the Quest for Artificial General Intelligence,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Jonathan Grudin  Microsoft Corporation Richard Jacques  Microsoft Corporation,What began as a quest for artificial general intelligence branched into several pursuits  including intelligent assistants developed by tech companies and task-oriented chatbots that deliver more information or services in specific domains. Progress quickened with the spread of low-latency networking  then accelerated dramatically a few years ago. In 2016  task-focused chatbots became a centerpiece of machine intelligence  promising interfaces that are more engaging than robotic answering systems and that can accommodate our increasingly phone-based information needs. Hundreds of thousands were built. Creating successful non-trivial chatbots proved more difficult than anticipated. Some developers now design for human-chatbot (humbot) teams  with people handling difficult queries. This paper describes the conversational agent space  difficulties in meeting user expectations  potential new design approaches  uses of human-bot hybrids  and implications for the ultimate goal of creating software with general intelligence.
"Wait  Do I Know This Person?": Understanding Misdirected Email,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Emilee Rader  Michigan State University Anjali Munasinghe  Michigan State University,Email is an essential tool for communication and social interaction. It also functions as a broadcast medium connecting businesses with their customers  as an authentication mechanism  and as a vector for scams and security threats. These uses are enabled by the fact that the only barrier to reaching someone by email is knowing his or her email address. This feature has given rise to the spam email industry but also has another side-effect that is becoming increasingly common: misdirected email  or legitimate emails that are intended for somebody else but are sent to the wrong recipient. In this paper we present findings from an interview study and survey focusing on characteristics of misdirected email messages  possible reasons why they happen  and how people manage these messages when they receive them. Misdirected email arises as a result of signifiers (usernames) which were selected by people for social and self-representation purposes  that are also used by machines for addressing. Because there is no mechanism for dealing with misdirected emails in a systematic way  individual recipients must choose whether to take action and how much effort to put forth to prevent potential negative consequences for themselves and others.
Opportunities for Automating Email Processing: A Need-Finding Study,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Soya Park  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Amy X. Zhang  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Luke S. Murray  Massachusetts Institute of Technology David R. Karger  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Email management consumes significant effort from senders and recipients. Some of this work might be automatable. We performed a mixed-methods need-finding study to learn: (i) what sort of automatic email handling users want  and (ii) what kinds of information and computation are needed to support that automation. Our investigation included a design workshop to identify categories of needs  a survey to better understand those categories  and a classification of existing email automation software to determine which needs have been addressed. Our results highlight the need for: a richer data model for rules  more ways to manage attention  leveraging internal and external email context  complex processing such as response aggregation  and affordances for senders. To further investigate our findings  we developed a platform for authoring small scripts over a user's inbox. Of the automations found in our studies  half are impossible in popular email clients  motivating new design directions.
Explaining Decision-Making Algorithms through UI: Strategies to Help Non-Expert Stakeholders,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Hao Fei Cheng  University of Minnesota Ruotong Wang  Macalester College Zheng Zhang  University of Minnesota Fiona O'Connell  University of Chicago Terrance Gray  University of Minnesota F. Maxwell Harper  University of Minnesota Haiyi Zhu  University of Minnesota,Increasingly  algorithms are used to make important decisions across society. However  these algorithms are usually poorly understood  which can reduce transparency and evoke negative emotions. In this research  we seek to learn design principles for explanation interfaces that communicate how decision-making algorithms work  in order to help organizations explain their decisions to stakeholders  or to support users' "right to explanation". We conducted an online experiment where 199 participants used different explanation interfaces to understand an algorithm for making university admissions decisions. We measured users' objective and self-reported understanding of the algorithm. Our results show that both interactive explanations and "white-box" explanations (i.e. that show the inner workings of an algorithm) can improve users' comprehension. Although the interactive approach is more effective at improving comprehension  it comes with a trade-off of taking more time. Surprisingly  we also find that users' trust in algorithmic decisions is not affected by the explanation interface or their level of comprehension of the algorithm.
User Experience (UX) Research in Games,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,Lennart E.

Online Idea Management for Civic Engagement: A Study on the Benefits of Integration with Social Networking ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Jorge Saldivar  Catholic University Florian Daniel  Politecnico di Milano Luca Cernuzzi  Catholic University of Asuncion Fabio Casati  University of Trento,Idea Management (IM) has increasingly been adopted in the civic domain as a tool to engage the citizenry in processes oriented toward innovating plans  policies  and services. While Idea Management Systems (IMSs)  i.e.  the software systems that instrument IM  definitely help manage this practice  they require citizens to be committed to a separate virtual space for which they need to register  they must learn how to operate  and they must return to frequently. This paper presents an approach that integrates IMS with today's most popular digital spaces of participation  the social networking sites  enabling citizens to engage in IM processes using ordinary tools and without having to step outside their daily habits. Our goal is to reach out and pull into IM the large and demographically diverse sectors of the society that are already present and participating in social networking sites. Through a real case study of IM in the public sector that mixed both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods  our proposal demonstrates to be a promising approach to reduce the barriers of participation. We conclude with an analysis of the strengths and limitations of our proposal.
Older Adults' Deployment of 'Distrust' ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Bran Knowles  Lancaster University Vicki L. Hanson  Rochester Institute of Technology,Older adults frequently deploy the concept of distrust when discussing digital technologies  and it is tempting to assume that distrust is largely responsible for the reduced uptake by older adults witnessed in the latest surveys of technology use. To help understand the impact of distrust on adoption behavior  we conducted focus groups with older adults exploring how  in what circumstances  and to what effect older adults articulate distrust in digital technologies. Our findings indicate that distrust is not especially relevant to older adults' practical decision making around technology (non-)use. The older adults in our study used the language of distrust to open up discussions around digital technologies to larger issues related to values. This suggests that looking to distrust as a predictor of non-use (e.g.\ in Technology Acceptance Model studies) may be uniquely unhelpful in the case of older adults  as it narrows the discussion of technology acceptance and trust to interactional issues  when their use of distrust pertains to much wider concerns. Likewise  technology adoption should not be viewed as indicative of trust or an endorsement of technology acceptability. Older adults using-while-distrusting offers important insights into how to design truly acceptable digital technologies.
Personal Informatics for Sport: Meaning  Body  and Social Relations in Amateur and Elite Athletes ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Amon Rapp  University of Torino Lia Tirabeni  University of Torino,Technological advances in wearable computing are changing the sports domain. A variety of Personal Informatics (PI) tools are starting to provide support and improve athletes' performance in many sports. In this article  we interviewed 20 amateur and elite athletes of different disciplines  using an array of PI devices  to explore how sports  as well as athletes' experience  are affected by such instruments. We discovered that amateur athletes present different patterns of usage compared to elite ones. Moreover  we found that elite athletes make sense of their data by exploiting the knowledge they have about their own body and sports practice. We then proposed four considerations for design that we believe should be explored in the future  to reflect on how self-tracking is changing our perspective on sports  and  by and large  on our everyday life.
Sound Forest: Evaluation of an Accessible Multisensory Music Installation,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Emma Frid  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Hans Lindetorp  KTH Royal Institute of Technology & KMH Royal College of Music Kjetil Falkenberg Hansen  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Ludvig Elblaus  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Roberto Bresin  KTH Royal Institute of Technology,Sound Forest is a music installation consisting of a room with light-emitting interactive strings  vibrating platforms and speakers  situated at the Swedish Museum of Performing Arts. In this paper we present an exploratory study focusing on evaluation of Sound Forest based on picture cards and interviews. Since Sound Forest should be accessible for everyone  regardless age or abilities  we invited children  teens and adults with physical and intellectual disabilities to take part in the evaluation. The main contribution of this work lies in its findings suggesting that multisensory platforms such as Sound Forest  providing whole-body vibrations  can be used to provide visitors of different ages and abilities with similar associations to musical experiences. Interviews also revealed positive responses to haptic feedback in this context. Participants of different ages used different strategies and bodily modes of interaction in Sound Forest  with activities ranging from running to synchronized music-making and collaborative play.
Integrated Workflows: Generating Feedback Between Digital and Physical Realms,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Emrecan Gulay  Aalto University Andrés Lucero  Aalto University,As design thinking shifted away from conventional methods with the rapid adoption of computer-aided design and fabrication technologies  architects have been seeking ways to initiate a comprehensive dialogue between the virtual and the material realms. Current methodologies do not offer embodied workflows that utilize the feedback obtained through a subsequent transition process between physical and digital design. Therefore  narrowing the separation between these two platforms remains as a research problem. This literature review elaborates the divide between physical and digital design  testing and manufacturing techniques in the morphological process of architectural form. We first review the digital transformation in the architectural design discourse. Then  we proceed by introducing a variety of methods that are integrating digital and physical workflows and suggesting an alternative approach. Our work unveils that there is a need for empirical research with a focus on integrated approaches to create intuitively embodied experiences for architectural designers.
ModiFiber: Two-Way Morphing Soft Thread Actuators for Tangible Interaction,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Jack Forman  Carnegie Mellon University Taylor Tabb  Carnegie Mellon University Youngwook Do  Carnegie Mellon University Meng-Han Yeh  Carnegie Mellon University Adrian Galvin  Carnegie Mellon University Lining Yao  Carnegie Mellon University,Despite thin-line actuators becoming widely adopted in different Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) contexts  including integration into fabrics  paper art  hinges  soft robotics  and human hair  accessible line-based actuators are very limited beyond shape memory alloy (SMA) wire and motor-driven passive tendons. In this paper  we introduce a novel  yet simple and accessible  line-based actuator. ModiFiber is a twisted-then-coiled nylon thread actuator with a silicone coating. This composite thread actuator exhibits unique two-way reversible shrinking or twisting behaviors triggered by heat or electrical current (i.e.  Joule heating). ModiFiber is soft  flexible  safe to operate and easily woven or sewn  hence it has a great potential as an embedded line-based actuator for HCI purposes. In this paper  we explain the material mechanisms and manufacturing approaches  followed by some performance tests and application demonstrations.
VibEye: Vibration-Mediated Object Recognition for Tangible Interactive Applications,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Seungjae Oh  Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) Gyeore Yun  Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) Chaeyong Park  Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) Jinsoo Kim  Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) Seungmoon Choi  Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH),We present VibEye: a vibration-mediated recognition system of objects for tangible interaction. A user holds an object between two fingers wearing VibEye. VibEye triggers a vibration from one finger  and the vibration that has propagated through the object is sensed at the other finger. This vibration includes information about the object's identity  and we represent it using a spectrogram. Collecting the spectrograms of many objects  we formulate the object recognition problem to a classical classification problem among the images. This simple method  when tested with 20 users  shows 92.5% accuracy for 16 objects of the same shape with various materials. This material-based classifier is also extended to the recognition of everyday objects. Lastly  we demonstrate several tangible applications where VibEye provides the needed functionality while enhancing user experiences. VibEye is particularly effective for recognizing objects made of different materials  which is difficult to distinguish by other means such as light and sound.
SmartEye: Assisting Instant Photo Taking via Integrating User Preference with Deep View Proposal Network,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Forth,Shuai Ma  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Zijun Wei  Stony Brook University Feng Tian  Institute of software  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Xiangmin Fan  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Jianming Zhang  Adobe Research Xiaohui Shen  ByteDance AI Lab Zhe Lin  Adobe Research Jin Huang  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Radomír Měch  Adobe Research Dimitris Samaras  Stony Brook University Hongan Wang  Institute of Software  Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Instant photo taking and sharing has become one of the most popular forms of social networking. However  taking high-quality photos is difficult as it requires knowledge and skill in photography that most non-expert users lack. In this paper we present SmartEye  a novel mobile system to help users take photos with good compositions in-situ. The back-end of SmartEye integrates the View Proposal Network (VPN)  a deep learning based model that outputs composition suggestions in real time  and a novel  interactively updated module (P-Module) that adjusts the VPN outputs to account for personalized composition preferences. We also design a novel interface with functions at the front-end to enable real-time and informative interactions for photo taking. We conduct two user studies to investigate SmartEye qualitatively and quantitatively. Results show that SmartEye effectively models and predicts personalized composition preferences  provides instant high-quality compositions in-situ  and outperforms the non-personalized systems significantly.
Improving Early Navigation in Time-Lapse Video with Spread-Frame Loading,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Forth,Carl Gutwin  University of Saskatchewan Michael van der Kamp  University of Saskatchewan Md. Sami Uddin  University of Saskatchewan Kevin Stanley  University of Saskatchewan Ian Stavness  University of Saskatchewan Sally Vail  Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Time-lapse videos are often navigated by scrubbing with a slider. When networks are slow or images are large  however  even thumbnail versions load so slowly that scrubbing is limited to the start of the video. We developed a frame-loading technique called spread-loading that enables scrubbing regardless of delivery rate. Spread-loading orders frame delivery to maximize coverage of the entire sequence; this provides a temporal overview of the entire video that can be fully navigated at any time during delivery. The overview initially has a coarse temporal resolution  becoming finer-grained with each new frame. We compared spread-loading with traditional linear loading in a study where participants were asked to find specific episodes in a long time-lapse sequence  using three views with increasing levels of detail. Results show that participants found target episodes significantly and substantially faster with spread-loading  regardless of whether they could click to change the load point. Users rated spread-loading as requiring less effort  and strongly preferred the new technique.
RePlay: Contextually Presenting Learning Videos Across Software Applications,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Forth,C. Ailie Fraser  University of California  San Diego & Adobe Research Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego Mira Dontcheva  Adobe Research Scott Klemmer  University of California  San Diego,Complex activities often require people to work across multiple software applications. However  people frequently lack valuable knowledge about at least one application  especially as software changes and new software emerges. Existing help systems either lack contextual knowledge or are tightly-knit into a single application. We introduce an application-independent approach for contextually presenting video learning resources and demonstrate it through the RePlay system. RePlay uses accessibility APIs to gather context about the user's activity. It leverages an existing search engine to present relevant videos and highlights key segments within them using video captions. We report on a week-long field study (n=7) and a lab study (n=24) showing that contextual assistance helps people spend less time away from their task than web video search and replaces current video navigation strategies. Our findings highlight challenges with representing and using context across applications.
TrackCap: Enabling Smartphones for 3D Interaction on Mobile Head-Mounted Displays,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Forth,Peter Mohr  Graz University of Technology & VRVis Zentrum für Virtual Reality und Visualisierung Forschungs-GmbH Markus Tatzgern  Salzburg University of Applied Sciences Tobias Langlotz  University of Otago Andreas Lang  Graz University of Technology & Salzburg University of Applied Sciences Dieter Schmalstieg  Graz University of Technology Denis Kalkofen  Graz University of Technology,The latest generation of consumer market Head-mounted displays (HMD) now include self-contained inside-out tracking of head motions  which makes them suitable for mobile applications. However  3D tracking of input devices is either not included at all or requires to keep the device in sight  so that it can be observed from a sensor mounted on the HMD. Both approaches make natural interactions cumbersome in mobile applications. TrackCap  a novel approach for 3D tracking of input devices  turns a conventional smartphone into a precise 6DOF input device for an HMD user. The device can be conveniently operated both inside and outside the HMD's field of view  while it provides additional 2D input and output capabilities.
Collaborative Practices with Structured Data: Do Tools Support What Users Need?,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Gala,Laura Koesten  University of Southampton Emilia Kacprzak  University of Southampton Jeni Tennison  The Open Data Institute Elena Simperl  University of Southampton,Collaborative work with data is increasingly common and spans a broad range of activities - from creating or analysing data in a team  to sharing it with others  to reusing someone else's data in a new context. In this paper  we explore collaboration practices around structured data and how they are supported by current technology. We present the results of an interview study with twenty data practitioners  from which we derive four high-level user needs for tool support. We compare them against the capabilities of twenty systems that are commonly associated with data activities  including data publishing software  wikis  web-based collaboration tools  and online community platforms. Our findings suggest that data-centric collaborative work would benefit from: structured documentation of data and its lifecycle; advanced affordances for conversations among collaborators; better change control; and custom data access. The findings help us formalise practices around data teamwork  and build a better understanding how people's motivations and barriers when working with structured data.
Our Story: Addressing Challenges in Development Contexts for Sustainable Participatory Video,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Gala,Tom Bartindale  Monash University Delvin Varghese  Newcastle University Guy Schofield  University of York Miki Tsukamoto  International Federation of Red Cross & Red Crescent Societies,Participatory Video (PV) is emerging as a rich and valuable method for monitoring and evaluating (M & E) projects in the International Development sector. Although shown to be useful for engaging communities within short-term monitoring exercises or promotion  PV in these contexts presents significant complexity and logistical challenges for sustained uptake by Development organizations. In this paper  we present Our Story  a digitally mediated work flow iteratively designed and deployed on initiatives in Indonesia and Namibia. Developed in collaboration with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC)  it supports end-to-end PV production in the field  and was specifically developed to make PV a more sustainable tool for monitoring. We discuss and evaluate Our Story  reporting on how by lowering skills barriers for facilitators and leveraging consumer technology  PV can be delivered at scale.
People Who Can Take It: How Women Wikipedians Negotiate and Navigate Safety,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Gala,Amanda Menking  University of Washington Ingrid Erickson  Syracuse University Wanda Pratt  University of Washington,Wikipedia is one of the most successful online communities in history  yet it struggles to attract and retain women editors—a phenomenon known as the gender gap. We investigate this gap by focusing on the voices of experienced women Wikipedians. In this interview-based study (N=25)  we identify a core theme among these voices: safety. We reveal how our participants perceive safety within their community  how they manage their safety both conceptually and physically  and how they act on this understanding to create safe spaces on and off Wikipedia. Our analysis shows Wikipedia functions as both a multidimensional and porous space encompassing a spectrum of safety. Navigating this space requires these women to employ sophisticated tactics related to identity management  boundary management  and emotion work. We conclude with a set of provocations to spur the design of future online environments that encourage equity  inclusivity  and safety for historically marginalized users.
Encoding Materials and Data for Iterative Personalization,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Gala,Troy Nachtigall  Eindhoven University of Technology Oscar Tomico  Eindhoven University of Technology & Elisava Ron Wakkary  Eindhoven University of Technology & Simon Fraser University Pauline van Dongen  Eindhoven University of Technology,Data is changing how we design consumer products. Shoe production is a prime example of this; foot size  footstep pressure and personal preferences can be used to design personalized shoes. Research done around metamaterials  programming materials and computational composites illustrate the possibilities of creating complex data & material relationships. These new relationships allow us to look at future products almost like software apps  becoming a kind of product service systems  where the focus is on its iterative personalization improvement over time. Can we create systems of such data driven objects that in turn allow us to design new objects that are informed by the data trail? In this paper we report on four RtD project iterations that explore this challenge and provide a set of insights on how to close this new iterative loop.
Collective Privacy Management in Social Media: A Cross-cultural Validation ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Hichang Cho  National University of Singapore Bart Knijnenburg  Clemson University Alfred Kobsa  University of California  Irvine Yao Li  University of California  Irvine,If one wants to study privacy from an intercultural perspective  one must first validate whether there are any cultural variations in the concept of "privacy" itself. This study systematically examines cultural differences in collective privacy management strategies  and highlights methodological precautions that must be taken in quantitative intercultural privacy research. Using survey data of 498 Facebook users from the US  Singapore  and South Korea  we test the validity and cultural invariance of the measurement model and predictive model associated with collective privacy management. The results show that the measurement model is only partially culturally invariant  indicating that social media users in different countries interpret the same instruments in different ways. Also  cross-national comparisons of the structural model show that causal pathways from collective privacy management strategies to privacy-related outcomes vary significantly across countries. The findings suggest significant cultural variations in privacy management practices  both with regard to the conceptualization of its theoretical constructs  and with respect to causal pathways.
Social Support  Reciprocity  and Anonymity in Responses to Sexual Abuse Disclosures on Social Media ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Nazanin Andalibi  University of Michigan Oliver L. Haimson  University of Michigan Munmun De Choudhury  Georgia Institute of Technology Andrea Forte  Drexel University,Seeking and providing support is challenging. When people disclose sensitive information  audience responses can substantially impact the discloser's wellbeing. We use mixed methods to understand responses to online sexual abuse-related disclosures on Reddit. We characterize disclosure responses  then investigate relationships between post content  comment content  and anonymity. We illustrate what types of support sought and provided in posts and comments co-occur. We find that posts seeking support receive more comments  and comments from "throwaway" (i.e.  anonymous) accounts are more likely on posts also from throwaway accounts. Anonymous commenting enables commenters to share intimate content such as reciprocal disclosures and supportive messages  and commenter anonymity is not associated with aggressive or unsupportive comments. We argue that anonymity is an essential factor in designing social technologies that facilitate support seeking and provision in socially stigmatized contexts  and provide implications for social media site design. CAUTION: This article includes content about sexual abuse.
Responding to Sensitive Disclosures on Social Media: A Decision Making Framework ,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Nazanin Andalibi  University of Michigan Andrea Forte  Drexel University,When people disclose information on social media that is sensitive or potentially stigmatized (e.g.  mental illness  pregnancy loss)  how do others decide to respond? We use interviews and vignettes to provide a response decision-making framework (RDM) that explains factors informing whether and how individuals respond to sensitive disclosures from their social media connections. The RDM framework includes factors related to the self  poster  and disclosure context (i.e.  relational  temporal  social). Our findings include how people's decisions are complicated by balancing their own needs (e.g.  privacy  wellbeing) as well as the posters' (e.g.  support) when seeing what they consider sensitive posts on social media. We identify empirically grounded insights and information that social media designs could surface to support both potential disclosers and responders. We argue that social media sites should provide privacy controls for both disclosers and responders  and facilitate the visibility of network-level support.
Virtual Hubs: Understanding Relational Aspects and Remediating Incubation,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Jandy Luik  University of York & Petra Christian University Jenna Ng  University of York Jonathan Hook  University of York,We have recently seen the emergence of new platforms that aim to provide remotely located entrepreneurs and startup companies with support analogous to that found within traditional incubation or acceleration spaces. This paper offers an understanding of these 'virtual hubs'  and the inherently socio-technical interactions that occur between their members. Our study analyzes a sample of existing virtual hubs in two stages. First  we contribute broader insight into the current landscape of virtual hubs by documenting and categorizing 25 hubs regarding their form  support offered and a selection of further qualities. Second  we contribute detailed insight into the operation and experience of such hubs  from an analysis of 10 semi-structured interviews with organizers and participants of virtual hubs. We conclude by analyzing our findings in terms of relational aspects of non-virtual hubs from the literature and remediation theory  and propose opportunities for advancing the design of such platforms.
Like A Second Skin: Understanding How Epidermal Devices Affect Human Tactile Perception,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Aditya Shekhar Nittala  Saarland University Klaus Kruttwig  INM-Leibniz Institute for New Materials Jaeyeon Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Roland Bennewitz  INM-Leibniz Institute for New Materials Eduard Arzt  INM-Leibniz Institute for New Materials Jürgen Steimle  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus,The emerging class of epidermal devices opens up new opportunities for skin-based sensing  computing  and interaction. Future design of these devices requires an understanding of how skin-worn devices affect the natural tactile perception. In this study  we approach this research challenge by proposing a novel classification system for epidermal devices based on flexural rigidity and by testing advanced adhesive materials  including tattoo paper and thin films of poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). We report on the results of three psychophysical experiments that investigated the effect of epidermal devices of different rigidity on passive and active tactile perception. We analyzed human tactile sensitivity thresholds  two-point discrimination thresholds  and roughness discrimination abilities on three different body locations (fingertip  hand  forearm). Generally  a correlation was found between device rigidity and tactile sensitivity thresholds as well as roughness discrimination ability. Surprisingly  thin epidermal devices based on PDMS with a hundred times the rigidity of commonly used tattoo paper resulted in comparable levels of tactile acuity. The material offers the benefit of increased robustness against wear and the option to re-use the device. Based on our findings  we derive design recommendations for epidermal devices that combine tactile perception with device robustness.
Optimising Encoding for Vibrotactile Skin Reading,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Granit Luzhnica  Know Center Eduardo Veas  Graz University of Technology & Know Center,This paper proposes methods of optimising alphabet encoding for skin reading in order to avoid perception errors. First  a user study with 16 participants using two body locations serves to identify issues in recognition of both individual letters and words. To avoid such issues  a two-step optimisation method of the symbol encoding is proposed and validated in a second user study with eight participants using the optimised encoding with a seven vibromotor wearable layout on the back of the hand. The results show significant improvements in the recognition accuracy of letters (97%) and words (97%) when compared to the non-optimised encoding.
Frequency-Based Design of Smart Textiles,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Jussi Mikkonen  Syddansk Universitet Riikka Townsend  Aalto University,Despite the increasing amount of smart textile design practitioners  the methods and tools commonly available have not progressed to the same scale. Most smart textile interaction designs today rely on detecting changes in resistance. The tools and sensors for this are generally limited to DC-voltage-divider based sensors and multimeters. Furthermore  the textiles and the materials used in smart textile design can exhibit behaviour making it difficult to identify even simple interactions using those means. For instance  steel-based textiles exhibit intrinsic semiconductive properties that are difficult to identify with current methods. In this paper  we show an alternative way to measure interaction with smart textiles. By relying on visualisation known as Lissajous-figures and frequency-based signals  we can detect even subtle and varied forms of interaction with smart textiles. We also show an approach to measuring frequency-based signals and present an Arduino-based system called Teksig to support this type of textile practice.
AdaCAD: Crafting Software For Smart Textiles Design,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Mikhaila Friske  University of Colorado Boulder Shanel Wu  University of Colorado Boulder Laura Devendorf  University of Colorado Boulder,Woven smart textiles are useful in creating flexible electronics because they integrate circuitry into the structure of the fabric itself. However  there do not yet exist tools that support the specific needs of smart textiles weavers. This paper describes the process and development of AdaCAD  an application for composing smart textile weave drafts. By augmenting traditional weaving drafts  AdaCAD allows weavers to design woven structures and circuitry in tandem and offers specific support for common smart textiles techniques. We describe these techniques  how our tool supports them alongside feedback from smart textiles weavers. We conclude with a reflection on smart textiles practice more broadly and suggest that the metaphor of coproduction can be fruitful in creating effective tools and envisioning future applications in this space.
Expecting the Unexpected in Participatory Design,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island A CROWNE,Aurora Constantin  University of Edinburgh Jessica Korte  University of Queensland Jerry Alan Fails  Boise State University Cristina Adriana Alexandru  University of Edinburgh Mihaela Dragomir  University of Edinburgh Helen Pain  University of Edinburgh Judith Good  University of Sussex Franca Garzotto  Politecnico di Milano Eva Eriksson  Aarhus University & Chalmers University of Technology Annalu Waller  University of Dundee,Participatory Design (PD) provides unique benefits in designing technology with and for specific target audiences. However  it can also be an intensive and difficult process  with unexpected situations which can arise at any stage. In this Special Interest Group (SIG)  we propose that PD researchers may exchange ''war stories'' about their unexpected and difficult experiences with PD. This will facilitate reflective discussions and the identification of possible solutions  and enable future PD research to plan for similar situations  thereby making difficulties a little less unexpected.
SRC01: Can Changes in Heart Rate Variability Represented in Sound be Identified by Non-Medical Experts?,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Mariam Bahameish  Queen Mary University of London,Heart rate variability (HRV) has become a wide-spread area for the investigation of the health and stress states of individuals. This paper aims at exploring the effectiveness of representing HRV measures with alternative modalities  other than visual displays  such as audio or haptics. Therefore  we undertook a preliminary study in which we applied a parameter mapping sonification approach to transform the HRV signal into an audible form. In this work  we sought to evaluate the human perception of the developed auditory interface. Hence  a dataset that involves interbeat interval measurements of individuals experiencing changes in mental state in the form of meditation was selected as the basis of the study. The HRV parameters of the dataset were mapped to acoustic features using a linear mapping technique. The feasibility of the system was assessed by measuring the learnability  performance  latency  and confidence aspects. The results suggest a great potential of incorporating auditory displays in the analysis of HRV. Participants were able to distinguish the different meditation states and types with minimal training time. However  further studies should be conducted on a larger population to provide verification of the findings of this preliminary study.
SRC02: Muse: Scaffolding Metacognitive Reflection in Design-Based Research,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Victoria Cabales  Northwestern University,While learning science research has explored approaches improving students' problem solving skills by introducing tools that support students in metacognitive reflection  this work has focused on problems with clear solutions  rather than addressing the question of how metacognitive reflection can help students develop their self-regulation skills  which help students understand and control their learning environment through planning  practice  and self-evaluation. This paper presents Muse  an in-action chatbot interface that prompts students to reflect metacognitively on their self-direction process in the midst of working on their independent research projects. Students participate in the Design  Technology  and Research (DTR) program  which provides several undergrads the opportunity to self-direct an independent research project by using the socio-technological model Agile Research Studios (ARS). Results from a case study suggest that Muse helps students identify time consuming habits and set aside less important tasks by giving participants the opportunity to act on their reflections and adjust aspects of their process that they deem less effective.
SRC03: Guidelines for Combining Storytelling and Gamification: Which Features Would Teenagers Desire to Have a More Enjoyable Museum Experience?,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Vanessa Cesário  University of Porto & Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute,While museums are often designed to engage and interest a wide variety of audiences  teenagers are a neglected segment. This PhD research in Digital Media explores how digital technologies can facilitate natural history museums in creating immersive museum experiences for teenagers (15–18 years old)  especially through digital storytelling and gamification frameworks. This contribution would be a set of guidelines that will aid in designing interactive experiences inside these museums. So far  we have involved a total of 155 teens through co-design sessions  130 in focus groups  and 98 in usability studies  as well as 3 museums  12 curators  and 17 master students. Through qualitative analysis  our preliminary findings suggest that teenagers value gamification and storytelling elements when thinking about enjoyable museum tours  while curators value story-based narratives as the most prominent method to provide enjoyable museum experience for teens. Based on the findings identified  and in collaboration with the Madeira-ITI  two interactive mobile experiences targeted at teenagers were developed for the Natural History Museum of Funchal  Portugal.
SRC04: Understanding the Occupational Therapists Method to Inform the Design of Technologies for People with Dementia,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Emma Dixon  University of Maryland  College Park,This paper describes a PhD research project involving people with dementia and practitioners who work primarily with people with dementia to support engagement in meaningful activities and activities of everyday living. The aim of this work is to develop a technology which adapts to changing cognitive demands of people with dementia in order to facilitate continuous engagement in meaningful activities. In depth  semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners to understand their methods for personalization of activities and the implications for design of future adaptive technologies. Preliminary results from interviews with Occupational Therapists are presented.
SRC05: Lake: A Digital Wizard of Oz Prototyping Tool,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Andrew Finke  Northwestern University,Mobile app designers aim to develop the best mobile software interfaces in the least amount of time  and rely on testing ideas with prototypes in lieu of building costly  fully functioning applications. Yet  designers cannot effectively prototype some complex app experiences  including augmented reality applications like Pokémon GO  because existing tools lack the needed features  or because prototyping in them is too time intensive to be feasible. To solve this problem  we introduce Lake  a mobile application prototyping tool that enables the creation of complex mobile applications with the same ease as paper prototyping. By leveraging the Wizard of Oz technique used in paper prototyping in our digital medium  we enable designers to prototype at the same low cost as paper  but at a much higher fidelity. Through a pilot study (N=6)  we find that designers are able to gather organic in-context feedback from complex prototypes made with Lake.
SRC06: Automatic Speech Recognition Services: Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Usability,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Abraham Glasser  Rochester Institute of Technology,Nowadays  speech is becoming a more common  if not standard  interface to technology. This can be seen in the trend of technology changes over the years. Increasingly  voice is used to control programs  appliances and personal devices within homes  cars  workplaces  and public spaces through smartphones and home assistant devices using Amazon's Alexa  Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri  and other proliferating technologies. However  most speech interfaces are not accessible for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) people. In this paper  performances of current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with voices of DHH speakers are evaluated. ASR has improved over the years  and is able to reach Word Error Rates (WER) as low as 5-6% [1][2][3]  with the help of cloud-computing and machine learning algorithms that take in custom vocabulary models. In this paper  a custom vocabulary model is used  and the significance of the improvement is evaluated when using DHH speech.
SRC07: Affordable Smart Wheelchair,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Isabella Gomez Torres  University of California  San Diego Gaurav Parmar  University of California  San Diego Sammarth Aggarwal  University of California  San Diego Nathaniel Mansur  University of California  San Diego Alec Guthrie  University California  San Diego,Power wheelchairs (PW) are an example of an assistive technology in that they are used to increase  maintain  or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities [6]. As seen in [5] [3]  the commercially available products do not provide any assistance beyond enhanced mobility. Furthermore  existing PW research fails at comprehensively noting an individual's challenges  such as navigating through narrow passages or fixing their broken wheelchairs. Instead  they focus mostly on novel interaction methods such as BCI  head and gaze control [9] [15]. In this paper  we explore these individual needs and show that PWs have the novel potential to become a smart wheelchair at an affordable price. Our research follows the double diamond (DD) process [2] and relies on the participatory design (PD) methodology [7]  which addresses all stakeholders involved. Namely  we consider individuals with wheelchairs  the assistive technology research community  and the PW industry. For further insight we also contacted medical doctors  healthcare professionals  and non- profit organizations. We spent time getting to know these communities through interviews  surveys  demonstrations  and continuous user inputs  aligning our work to the PD tools. We found that individuals using wheelchairs overall desire safety  accessibility  and a durable design. Guided by these results  we designed a proof of concept (POC) system called the Affordable Smart Wheelchair (ASW) for indoor use. This kit implements full-autonomy in the form of indoor navigation from one room to another and to predetermined docking locations through voice control. It also has semi-autonomous functions in the form of manual joystick control augmented with real-time collision avoidance and staircase detection.
SRC08: Math Graphs for the Visually Impaired: Audio Presentation of Elements of Mathematical Graphs,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Jeongyeon Kim  Sogang University Yoonah Lee  Sogang University Inho Seo  Sogang University,The sense of sight takes a dominating role in learning mathematical graphs. Most visually impaired students drop out of mathematics because necessary content is inaccessible. Sonification and auditory graphs have been the primary methods of representing data through sound. However  the representation of mathematical elements of graphs is still unexplored. The experiments in this paper investigate optimal methods for representing mathematical elements of graphs with sound. The results indicate that the methods of design in this study are effective for describing mathematical elements of graphs  such as axes  quadrants and differentiability. These findings can help visually impaired learners to be more independent  and also facilitate further studies on assistive technology.
SRC09: I Am What You Eat: Effects of Social Influence on Meal Selection Online,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Maria D. Molina  Pennsylvania State University,The availability of mHealth technologies has increased exponentially  particularly fitness and calorie tracking applications. Recent studies and anecdotal evidence has highlighted the potential of these technologies to serve as tools of bad eating behavior due to its focus on self-monitoring and calorie counting. The current research investigates on the potential of using social-orienting features of technology  specifically bandwagon and identity cues  to incentivize food-based nutrition (FBN) rather than a calorie-only approach. For this purpose  a 2 x 2 mixed factorial online experiment was conducted with bandwagon cue as a within-subject factor and identity cue as a between-subject factor. Results reveal that 67.6% of participants selected high bandwagon cue meals  regardless of its nutritional value. Bandwagon perception was the only significant predictor of meal selection  indicating that an increase in one unit improved the odds of an individual choosing a high bandwagon meal by 69%.
SRC10: Designing Compassion Cultivating Interactions for New Mothers,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Annu Sible Prabhakar  University of Cincinnati & Indiana University,This paper describes a research project that aims to examine an unexplored design space-compassion cultivation for wellness. This project seeks to understand the components of compassionate interactions between new mothers and their proximate and primary supporters-partners -- to inform the design of compassion cultivating interventions for maternal wellness. A discussion of research activities undertaken thus far and preliminary results are presented.
SRC11: Family-Centered Exploration of the Benefits and Burdens of Digital Home Assistants,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Olivia K. Richards  Pennsylvania State University,Parents receive conflicting information on the benefits and burdens of children's technology use  especially novel technologies such as digital home assistants. To understand parents' views  we analyzed relevant Amazon Echo device product reviews posted to Amazon.com  and deployed a User Benefit and Burden Survey to 131 parents on Amazon Mechanical Turk to explore their perspectives of Amazon Echo digital home assistants. Our work explores parents' perceptions of the devices with regards to their children and families  in terms of attributes such as benefits and burdens. This study contributes an empirical  family-centered understanding of and design opportunities for whole home personal assistants in support of a diversity of families.
SRC12: Privacy Therapy with Aretha: What If Your Firewall Could Talk?,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,William Seymour  University of Oxford,The rapid adoption of smart home devices has brought with it a widespread lack of understanding amongst users over where their devices send data. Smart home ecosystems represent complex additions to existing wicked problems around network privacy and security in the home. This work presents the Aretha project  a device which combines the functionality of a firewall with the position of voice assistants as the hub of the smart home  and the sophistication of modern conversational voice interfaces. The result is a device which can engage users in conversation about network privacy and security  allowing for the forming and development of complex preferences that Aretha is then able to act upon.
SRC13: ParaXplore: Demystifying the Exploration of Large Design Spaces,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Naghmi Shireen  Simon Fraser University,Generative design tools together with large screen displays provide designers an opportunity to explore large numbers of design alternatives. There are numerous design studies on exploring multiple simultaneous designs  but few present interface solutions and system features for such exploration. To the best of my knowledge  no study probes exploring a large design space with multiple simultaneous states. The premise of my research is that  if designers can work directly with large numbers of designs with new representations and tools as part of the design workflow  we should expect new patterns and strategies to emerge and change the design process. Such task environments may present novel actions  task sequences  methods and techniques. What are new actions and techniques that would enable working seamlessly with multiple designs? My research aims to answer this (and similar) questions; and  more specifically  to uncover how designers' augment their work through spatial structuring of the task environment to reduce the cognitive cost of working with multiple simultaneous designs on a large work-surface. I conducted a lab experiment with nine designers. The results suggest design features for new front-end gallery interfaces for managing a large set of design variations while enabling simultaneous editing.
SRC14: Sense of Familiarity: Improving Older Adults' Adaptation to Exergames,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Hao Zhang  Nanyang Technological University,Exergames are proven to be effective in helping older adults improve their physical and mental capabilities. However  older adults' maladaptation to exergames may occur due to the complexity of game tasks and interfaces. In this work  we show that familiarity can improve older adults' adaptation to exergames. The results of our first study indicate that older adults with higher level of familiarity to exergames exhibit higher level of motivation and ability. To maximize the effectiveness of exergames  it is helpful to provide older adults exergames which they are more familiar with. To evaluate the familiarity level of exergames  we propose a novel familiarity model with five factors  namely prior experience  positive emotion  repeated time  level of processing  and retention rate. Results from our second study show that the identified five factors have significant positive correlations with familiarity and there is a high positive correlation between familiarity levels and participants' satisfaction to the exergames.
SRC15: GPK: An Efficient Special Symbol Input Method for Keyboards,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Xiyuan He  Zhejiang University Zhuohao Zhang  Zhejiang University,We introduce a novel typing technique for special symbols in the keyboard-only environment. The technique  called GPK (Gliding on Physical Keyboard)  consists of two steps for entering special symbols. First  a user draws the special symbol on the keyboard by gliding over keys; Second  the user can select the desired symbol from the predicted symbols generated by GPK. Users can also switch from this mode to normal typing mode. We also present an application of this input technique based on web browsers. A user study with nine participants who are familiar with keyboard input showed the input efficiency of GPK. We compared the typing efficiency of GPK with other special symbol typing methods. We could deploy this method to office environments where users have desktop computers with a keyboard only. It could also inspire future work of integrating this method into word processors  document preparation systems and web environments.
Pay Attention  Please: Formal Language Improves Attention in Volunteer and Paid Online Experiments,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Lomond,Tal August  University of Washington Katharina Reinecke  University of Washington,Participant engagement in online studies is key to collecting reliable data  yet achieving it remains an often discussed challenge in the research community. One factor that might impact engagement is the formality of language used to communicate with participants throughout the study. Prior work has found that language formality can convey social cues and power hierarchies  affecting people's responses and actions. We explore how formality influences engagement  measured by attention  dropout  time spent on the study and participant performance  in an online study with 369 participants on Mechanical Turk (paid) and LabintheWild (volunteer). Formal language improves participant attention compared to using casual language in both paid and volunteer conditions  but does not affect dropout  time spent  or participant performance. We suggest using more formal language in studies containing complex tasks where fully reading instructions is especially important. We also highlight trade-offs that different recruitment incentives provide in online experimentation.
Decision-Making Under Uncertainty in Research Synthesis: Designing for the Garden of Forking Paths,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Lomond,Alex Kale  University of Washington Matthew Kay  University of Michigan Jessica Hullman  Northwestern University,To make evidence-based recommendations to decision-makers  researchers conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses must navigate a garden of forking paths: a series of analytical decision-points  each of which has the potential to influence findings. To identify challenges and opportunities related to designing systems to help researchers manage uncertainty around which of multiple analyses is best  we interviewed 11 professional researchers who conduct research synthesis to inform decision-making within three organizations. We conducted a qualitative analysis identifying 480 analytical decisions made by researchers throughout the scientific process. We present descriptions of current practices in applied research synthesis and corresponding design challenges: making it more feasible for researchers to try and compare analyses  shifting researchers' attention from rationales for decisions to impacts on results  and supporting communication techniques that acknowledge decision-makers' aversions to uncertainty. We identify opportunities to design systems which help researchers explore  reason about  and communicate uncertainty in decision-making about possible analyses in research synthesis.
­Understanding the Boundaries between Policymaking and HCI,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Lomond,Anne Spaa  Northumbria University Abigail Durrant  Northumbria University Chris Elsden  Northumbria University John Vines  Northumbria University,There is a growing body of literature in HCI examining the intersection between policymaking and technology research. However  what it means to engage in policymaking in our field  or the ways in which evidence from HCI studies is translated into policy  is not well understood. We report on interviews with 11 participants working at the intersection of technology research and policymaking. Analysis of this data highlights how evidence is understood and made sense of in policymaking processes  what forms of evidence are privileged over others  and the work that researchers engage in to meaningfully communicate their work to policymaking audiences. We discuss how our findings pose challenges for certain traditions of research in HCI  yet also open up new policy opportunities for those engaging in more speculative research practices. We conclude by discussing three ways forward that the HCI community can explore to increase engagement with policymaking contexts.
HCI and Affective Health: Taking stock of a decade of studies and charting future research directions,Thursday  May 09  2019 - 14:00:00,Thursday  May 09  2019 15:20,Lomond,Pedro Sanches  KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Axel Janson  KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Pavel Karpashevich  KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Camille Nadal  Trinity College Dublin Chengcheng Qu  Lancaster University Claudia Daudén Roquet  Lancaster University Muhammad Umair  Lancaster University Charles Windlin  KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Gavin Doherty  Trinity College Dublin Kristina Höök  Royal Institute of Technology KTH Corina Sas  Lancaster University,In the last decade  the number of articles on HCI and health has increased dramatically. We extracted 139 papers on depression  anxiety and bipolar health issues from 10 years of SIGCHI conference proceedings. 72 of these were published in the last two years. A systematic analysis of this growing body of literature revealed that most innovation happens in automated diagnosis  and self-tracking  although there are innovative ideas in tangible interfaces. We noted an overemphasis on data production without consideration of how it leads to fruitful interventions. Moreover  we see a need to promote ethical practices for involvement of people living with affective disorders. Finally  although only 16 studies evaluate technologies in a clinical context  several forms of support and intervention illustrate how rich insights are gained from evaluations with real patients. Our findings highlight potential for growth in the design space of affective health technologies.
