1,Designing for Outdoor Play,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Alsh 1,Gavin Wood  Northumbria University Jon Back  Uppsala University Jaz Hee-jeong Choi  RMIT University Thomas Dylan  Northumbria University Marti Louw  Carnegie Mellon University,There is widespread societal concern regarding the reduction in the amount of time that we all spend playing outdoors. Outdoor play can be important for our social and physical well-being and moreover helps us to connect to space  place and environment. Of course  the CHI community continues to explore play across many contexts; however  specifically designing for outdoor play remains underexplored. This workshop aims to bring together those who are interested in technological  social and design aspects of outdoor play for all ages. We will use participants' insights  energies and expertise to explore the challenges and focus on how we can build a community to share innovative designs  generate knowledge and make actionable research in this context.
2,With an Eye to the Future: HCI Practice and Research in the Arab World1,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Alsh 2,Ebtisam Alabdulqader  King Saud University Shaimaa Lazem  City of Scientific Research and Technology Applications Soud Nassir  University of Technology Sydney Mennatallah Saleh  Technical University inBerlin Sarah Armoush  Newcastle University Susan Dray  Dray Associates,ArabHCI initiative was inaugurated in a CHI17 SIG Meeting that brought together 45+ HCI Arab/non-Arab researchers/practitioners who are conducting/interested in HCI within Arab communities. The meeting started an ongoing dialogue that recognizes the fact that HCI is still in its infancy in the Arab world and explores challenges and opportunities for shaping the future of HCI in the region. The meeting was further followed by three successful meetings in SIGCHI sponsored events that included general discussions about the state of HCI research in Arab countries  and a thematic discussion on exploring participatory design practices with Arab communities. In this workshop  we build on the momentum generated by our previous meetings  and attempt to draw a roadmap for HCI research and practice in Arab world. Our goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss case studies from their own work  share experiences and lessons learned  and envision the future of the field in this area. We plan to share the results of our discussions and research agenda with the wider CHI community through various social and scholarly channels.
3,DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
4,DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.
5,DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
6,DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,"Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of ""futuring"" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities."
7,DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
8,DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
9,DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
10,DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.
11,DC09: Player Types of Gamers: Critical Evaluation,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Suvi K. Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
12,DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
13,DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
14,DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
15,DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
16,DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
17,DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
18,DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
19,DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
20,DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
21,DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.
22,DC20: Co-Designing Digital Technologies to Support Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 08:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 14:00,Forth,Cara Wilson  Queensland University of Technology,This doctoral work considers how to best co-design with minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum in classroom contexts. It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.
23,HCI Across Borders and Intersections,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Argyll 2 CROWNE,Neha Kumar  Georgia Institute of Technology Christian Sturm  Hamm-Lippstadt University of Applied Sciences Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed  University of Toronto Naveena Karusala  University of Washington Marisol Wong-Villacres  Georgia Institute of Technology Leonel Morales  Universidad Francisco Marroquín Rita Orji  Dalhousie University Michaelanne Dye  Georgia Institute of Technology Nova Ahmed  North South University Laura S. Gaytán-Lugo  Universidad de Colima Aditya Vashistha  University of Washington David Nemer  University of Kentucky Kurtis Heimerl  University of Washington Susan Dray  Dray Associates,The HCI Across Borders (HCIxB) community has been growing in recent years  thanks in particular to the Development Consortium at CHI 2016 and the HCIxB Symposia at CHI 2017 and 2018. This year  we propose an HCIxB symposium that continues to build scholarship potential of early career HCIxB researchers  strengthening ties between more and less experienced members of the community. We especially invite scholarship with a focus on intersections  examining and/or addressing multiple forms of marginalization (e.g. race  gender  class  among others).
24,EduCHI 2019 Symposium: Global Perspectives on HCI Education,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Argyll 3 CROWNE,Olivier St-Cyr  University of Toronto Craig M. MacDonald  Pratt Institute Elizabeth F. Churchill  Google Inc.,At CHI 2018  a workshop on developing a community of practice to support global HCI education was held  building on six years of research and collaboration in the area of HCI education. Many themes emerged from the workshop activities and discussions. Two particularly stood out: creating channels for discussions related to HCI education and providing a platform for sharing HCI curricula and teaching experiences. To that end  we are organizing a CHI 2019 symposium dedicated exclusively to HCI education: EduCHI 2019: Global Perspectives on HCI Education. The symposium will focus on the canons of HCI education in 2019 and beyond. It will offer a venue for HCI educators across disciplinary and geographical borders to discuss  dissect  and debate HCI teaching and learning. Through keynote addresses  paper presentations  and a panel discussion  we aim to discuss current and future HCI education trends  curricula  pedagogies  teaching practices  and diverse and inclusive HCI education. Post-symposium initiatives will aim to document and publish the discussions from the symposium.
25,HCI and Aging: Beyond Accessibility,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Boisdale 1,Bran Knowles  Lancaster University Vicki L. Hanson  The Association for Computing Machinery Yvonne Rogers  UCL Interaction Centre Anne Marie Piper  Northwestern University Jenny Waycott  The University of Melbourne Nigel Davies  Lancaster University,Despite improvements in the accessibility of digital technologies and growing numbers of tools designed specifically for older adults  adoption of such tools remains low for this demographic. This workshop aims to explore the contextual factors that contribute to reduced uptake among older adults in order to understand how to design digital technologies that will be appealing to and work for them  fitting with recent calls for more holistic approaches to designing for older adults. Going beyond standard accessibility considerations  and aiming to inform design of technologies for the general population rather than the design of senior-friendly variants of such tools  we will generate a set of principles for developing tools that older adults can and will use.
26,Looking into the Future: Weaving the Threads of Vehicle Automation,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Boisdale 2,Shadan Sadeghian Borojeni  Fraunhofer Institute Alexander Meschtscherjakov  University of Salzburg Bastian Pfleging  LMU Munich Wendy Ju  Cornell Tech Frank Flemisch  RWTH University Christian P. Janssen  Utrecht University Andrew L. Kun  University of New Hampshire Andreas Riener  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt,Automated driving is one of the most discussed disruptive technologies of this decade. It promises to increase drivers' safety and comfort  improve traffic flow  and lower fuel consumption. This has a significant impact on our everyday life and mobility behavior. Beyond the passengers of the vehicle  it also impacts others  for example by lowering the barriers to visit distant relatives. In line with the CHI2019 conference theme  our aim is to weave the threads of vehicle automation by gathering people from different disciplines  cultures  sectors  communities  and backgrounds (designers  researchers  and practitioners) in one community to look into concrete future scenarios of driving automation and its impact on HCI research and practice. Using design fiction  we will look into the future and use this fiction to guide discussions on how automated driving can be made a technology that works for people and society.
27,Where is the Human? Bridging the Gap Between AI and HCI,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Carron 1,Kori Inkpen  Microsoft Research Stevie Chancellor  Georgia Institute of Technology Munmun De Choudhury  Georgia Institute of Technology Michael Veale  University College London Eric P. S. Baumer  Lehigh University,In recent years  AI systems have become both more powerful and increasingly promising for integration in a variety of application areas. Attention has also been called to the social challenges these systems bring  particularly in how they might fail or even actively disadvantage marginalised social groups  or how their opacity might make them difficult to oversee and challenge. In the context of these and other challenges  the roles of humans working in tandem with these systems will be important  yet the HCI community has been only a quiet voice in these debates to date. This workshop aims to catalyse and crystallise an agenda around HCI's engagement with AI systems. Topics of interest include explainable and explorable AI; documentation and review; integrating artificial and human intelligence; collaborative decision making; AI/ML in HCI Design; diverse human roles and relationships in AI systems; and critical views of AI.
28,Hacking Blind Navigation,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Carron 2,João Guerreiro  Carnegie Mellon University Hernisa Kacorri  University of Maryland Jeffrey P. Bigham  Carnegie Mellon University Edward Cutrell  Microsoft Research Daisuke Sato  IBM Research - Tokyo Dragan Ahmetovic  Università degli Studi di Torino Chieko Asakawa  Carnegie Mellon University,Independent navigation in unfamiliar and complex environments is a major challenge for blind people. This challenge motivates a multi-disciplinary effort in the CHI community aimed at developing assistive technologies to support the orientation and mobility of blind people  including related disciplines such as accessible computing  cognitive sciences  computer vision  and ubiquitous computing. This workshop intends to bring these communities together to increase awareness on recent advances in blind navigation assistive technologies  benefit from diverse perspectives and expertises  discuss open research challenges  and explore avenues for multi-disciplinary collaborations. Interactions are fostered through a panel on Open Challenges and Avenues for Interdisciplinary Collaboration  Minute-Madness presentations  and a Hands-On Session where workshop participants can hack (design or prototype) new solutions to tackle open research challenges. An expected outcome is the emergence of new collaborations and research directions that can result in novel assistive technologies to support independent blind navigation.
29,Human-Centered Study of Data Science Work Practices,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Castle 1 CROWNE,Michael Muller  IBM Research Melanie Feinberg  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Timothy George  California Polytechnic Steven J. Jackson  Cornell University Bonnie E. John  Bloomberg L.P. Mary Beth Kery  Carnegie Mellon University Samir Passi  Cornell University,With the rise of big data  there has been an increasing need to understand who is working in data science and how they are doing their work. HCI and CSCW researchers have begun to examine these questions. In this workshop  we invite researchers to share their observations  experiences  hypotheses  and insights  in the hopes of developing a taxonomy of work practices and open issues in the behavioral and social study of data science and data science workers.
30,Troubling Innovation: Craft and Computing Across Boundaries,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Castle 2 CROWNE,Irene Posch  University of Art and Design Linz Ozge Subasi  Koc University Daniela K. Rosner  University of Washington Raune Frankjaer  Aarhus University Amit Zoran  Hebrew University Tania Pérez-Bustos  Universidad Nacional de Colombia,Craft practices such as needlework  ceramics  and woodworking have long informed and broadened the scope of HCI research. Whether through sewable microcontrollers or programs of small-scale production  they have helped widen the range of people and work recognised as technological and innovative. However  despite this promise  few organisational resources have successfully drawn together the disparate threads of scholarship and practice attending to HCI craft. In this workshop  we propose to gather a globally distributed group of craft contributors whose work reflects crucial but under-valued HCI positions  practices  and pedagogies  Through historically and politically engaged work  we seek to build community across boundaries and meaningfully broaden what constitutes innovation in HCI to date.
31,Designing for Digital Wellbeing: A Research & Practice Agenda,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Castle 3 CROWNE,Marta E. Cecchinato  Northumbria University John Rooksby  Northumbria University Alexis Hiniker  University of Washington Sean Munson  University of Washington Kai Lukoff  University of Washington Luigina Ciolfi  Sheffield Hallam University Anja Thieme  Microsoft Research Daniel Harrison  University College London,Traditionally  many consumer-focused technologies have been designed to maximize user engagement with their products and services. More recently  many technology companies have begun to introduce digital wellbeing features  such as for managing time spent and for encouraging breaks in use. These are in the context of  and likely in response to  renewed concerns in the media about technology dependency and even addiction. The promotion of technology abstinence is also increasingly widespread  e.g.  via digital detoxes. Given that digital technologies are an important and valuable feature of many people's lives  digital wellbeing features are arguably preferable to abstinence. However  how these are defined and designed is something that needs to be explored further. In this one-day workshop we welcome both industry and academic participants to discuss what digital wellbeing means  who is responsible for it  and whether and how we should design for it going forward.
32,Emerging Perspectives in Human-Centered Machine Learning,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Dochart 1,Gonzalo Ramos  Microsoft Research Jina Suh  Microsoft Research Soroush Ghorashi  Microsoft Research Christopher Meek  Microsoft Research Richard Banks  Microsoft Research Saleema Amershi  Microsoft Research Rebecca Fiebrink  Goldsmiths  University of London Alison Smith-Renner  University of Maryland Gagan Bansal  University of Washington,Current Machine Learning (ML) models can make predictions that are as good as or better than those made by people. The rapid adoption of this technology puts it at the forefront of systems that impact the lives of many  yet the consequences of this adoption are not fully understood. Therefore  work at the intersection of people's needs and ML systems is more relevant than ever. This area of work  dubbed Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML)  re-thinks ML research and systems in terms of human goals. HCML gathers an interdisciplinary group of HCI and ML practitioners  each bringing their unique  yet related perspectives. This one-day workshop is a successor of Gillies et al. 2016 CHI Workshop and focuses on recent advancements and emerging areas in HCML. We aim to discuss different perspectives on these areas and articulate a coordinated research agenda for the XXI century.

Mary Ellen Foster  University of Glasgow Kerstin Fischer  University of Southern Denmark Jessica R. Cauchard  Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya,The advances in Robotics offer exciting opportunities for robots to become socially collaborative technologies. But are we ready for and are the robots capable of enabling a good level of interaction and user experience? How can the CHI community work with the Human Robot Interaction (HRI) community to share best practices and methods in order to continue to advance research that crosses methodological and cultural boundaries between HRI and HCI? This workshop will bring together key researchers working in and across both HCI and HRI to share existing challenges and opportunities to advance the field of Socially Collaborative Robotics. We will look to share our recent research experiences and practices in order to build capacity in the crossings between HCI and HRI.
34,Technology to Mediate Role Conflict in Motherhood,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Fyne,Lisa Thomas  Northumbria University Elizabeth Sillence  Northumbria University Vicky Elsey  Northumbria University Emma Simpson  Newcastle University Louise Moody  Coventry University,Today  new mothers are experiencing parenthood differently. Digital resources can provide a wealth of information  present opportunities for socialising  and even assist in tracking a baby's development. However  women are often juggling the role of motherhood with other commitments  such as work. The aim of this workshop is to understand the digital support needs and practices during parenthood from the perspective of employed mothers. We are interested in exploring the ways that women utilise the technologies which have been designed to support mothers  and specifically  the importance of work-life balance and the various roles that mothers play. There is a need to better understand and identify which technologies are being used to support working women through their motherhood journey  and ensure a healthy transition to support women's changing identities.

The participants will reflect on how philosophy influenced the development of HCI in the past  how philosophical insights are being utilized in current HCI research  and how philosophy can help HCI identify and address the emerging challenges facing the field. The main objectives of the workshop are to bring together HCI researchers interested in philosophy and produce an agenda for future research bringing HCI and philosophy closer together.
37,DC^(2)S^(2): Designing Crowd-powered Creativity Support Systems,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Island A CROWNE,Jonas Oppenlaender  University of Oulu Maximilian Mackeprang  Freie Universität Berlin Abderrahmane Khiat  Freie Universität Berlin Maja Vuković  IBM Jorge Goncalves  The University of Melbourne Simo Hosio  University of Oulu,Supporting creativity has been considered as one of the grand challenges of Human Computer Interaction. All creativity lies within humanity and crowdsourcing is a powerful approach for tapping into the collective insights of diverse crowds. Thus  crowdsourcing has great potential in supporting creativity.In this workshop  we brainstorm new crowdsourcing systems and concepts for supporting creativity  by bringing together researchers and industry professionals in a full-day workshop. The workshop consists of discussions of ideas contributed by the participants and hands-on brainstorming sessions in groups for ideating new crowd-powered systems that support creativity. We center the workshop around two themes: supporting the individual and facilitating creativity in groups.
38,CHI 2019 Early Career Development Symposium,Saturday  May 04  2019 - 09:00:00,Saturday  May 04  2019 17:00,Island B CROWNE,Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto Mississauga Sharon Oviatt  Monash University,The first few years after completing a PhD can be challenging to navigate. Job hunting  interviewing  navigating new contexts such as a junior academic position  applying for funding as a first time project investigator  learning to adapt to the culture of an industry-based workplace  supervising graduate students or full-time employees – these are just a few of the scenarios recent PhD graduates find themselves in. Within HCI  one may encounter more discipline-specific challenges  such as keeping up with the CHI publication cycles while taking on new administrative duties. The CHI community  however  strives to be collectively supportive and inclusive of researchers at all stages of their career – this is even more important as many of our design approaches are rooted in empathy for and empowerment of participants. By more actively supporting each other as researchers in our career paths  we can better grow as a community  and reflect it back into our collective body of practice. The Early Career Development Symposium has been proposed (and held yearly since 2016) to provide a more formal mentoring venue that reflects our aims as a community to more meaningfully support each other.

However  the work patients do to construct their functioning health service systems often remain invisible  with very little resources and technologies available to assist them. This workshop aims to bring together researchers  health practitioners  and patients to examine  discuss  and brainstorm ways to re-envision our healthcare service systems from the perspective of patients and caregivers. We aim to unpack the types of work that patients and caregivers do to reconfigure  reconstruct and adapt the healthcare infrastructure  and to brainstorm design solutions that can provide better infrastructuring assistance to them."

44,iHDI: International Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Alsh 1,Anke M. Brock  ENAC - University Toulouse Jessica R. Cauchard  IDC Herzliya Markus Funk  TU Darmstadt Jérémie Garcia  ENAC - University Toulouse Mohamed Khamis  University of Glasgow Matjaž Kljun  University of Primorska,Commercial drones have recently been developed to encompass use cases beyond aerial photography and videography. Researchers have explored wider applications of drones including using drones as social companions  as key components in virtual environments  as assistive tools for people with disabilities  and even as sport companions. However the uptake of research in Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) also brought forth a plethora of challenges that are unique to this platform. While drones were initially considered as flying robots  recent works have shown that traditional Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) methodologies cannot simply be applied to HDI. For example  how do we deal with privacy and safety concerns associated with drones in public space? What is the appropriate methodology to evaluate HDI applications? How do the size  altitude  and speed of drones influence their perception? The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to identify: 1) novel HDI applications  and 2) key challenges in this area to drive research in the coming decade. The long-term goal is to create a strong interdisciplinary research community that includes researchers and practitioners from HCI  HRI  Ubiquitous Computing  Interaction Techniques  User Privacy  and Design.
45,Challenges Using Head-Mounted Displays in Shared and Social Spaces,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Alsh 2,Jan Gugenheimer  Ulm University Christian Mai  LMU Munich Mark McGill  University of Glasgow Julie Williamson  University of Glasgow Frank Steinicke  Universität Hamburg Ken Perlin  New York University,Everyday mobile usage of AR and VR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) is becoming a feasible consumer reality. The current research agenda for HMDs has a strong focus on technological impediments (e.g. latency  field of view  locomotion  tracking  input) as well as perceptual aspect (e.g. distance compression  vergence-accomodation ). However  this ignores significant challenges in the usage and acceptability of HMDs in shared  social and public spaces. This workshop will explore these key challenges of HMD usage in shared  social contexts; methods for tackling the virtual isolation of the VR/AR user and the exclusion of collocated others; the design of shared experiences in shared spaces; and the ethical implications of appropriating the environment and those within it.
46,DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
47,DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.
48,DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
49,DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,"Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of ""futuring"" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities."
50,DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
51,DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
52,DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
53,DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.
54,DC09: Player Types of Gamers: Critical Evaluation,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Suvi K. Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
55,DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
56,DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
57,DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
58,DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
59,DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
60,DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
61,DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
62,DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
63,DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
64,DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.
65,DC20: Co-Designing Digital Technologies to Support Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 08:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 14:00,Forth,Cara Wilson  Queensland University of Technology,This doctoral work considers how to best co-design with minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum in classroom contexts. It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.

We propose a Symposium at CHI 2019 to host WISH with the goal of facilitating a common space to share and discuss methods  study designs  and dissemination in a collaborative fashion. The symposium also aims to actively provide mentoring opportunities to junior and new health technology researchers – from undergraduates to mid-career researchers who want to focus on interactive systems in Healthcare. This will be the eighth WISH meeting in a series of successful workshops bringing together different research communities and practitioners around challenges of designing  implementing  and evaluating interactive health technologies.
67,4^(th) Symposium on Computing and Mental Health: Designing Ethical eMental Health Services,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Argyll 2 CROWNE,John Torous  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  Harvard Medical School Maria K. Wolters  University of Edinburgh Greg Wadley  University of Melbourne Rafael A. Calvo  University of Sydney,With psychiatric conditions like depression now the leading global causing of disability  the need for innovative solutions is apparent. The promise of mental health care delivered through technology (eMentalHealth) to provide personalized care offers a promising solution that has galvanized interest worldwide. However  in order to ensure that eMentalHealth is scalable and sustainable  service delivery and health and social care policies need to be integrated into the design of technology interventions. This will require new forms of interdisciplinary collaborations that we hope to foster in this symposium. Thus  in this fourth in our series of Symposia on Computing and Mental Health  the focus will beon the intersection of the communities innovating in this space: patients  designers  data scientists  clinicians  researchers  computer scientists  developers  and entrepreneurs guided by core medical ethical principles including respect for persons  beneficence  and justice. Our aim is thus to enable the vision of better mental health through ethical innovation powered by the right collaborations

69,Towards a Responsible Innovation Agenda for HCI,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Boisdale 1,Oliver Bates  Lancaster University Kathy New  Lancaster University Samantha Mitchell-Finnigan  Newcastle University Matthew Louis Mauriello  Stanford University Christian Remy  Aarhus University Roy Bendor  Delft University of Technology Samuel Mann  Otago Polytechnic Simran Chopra  Northumbria University Adrian K. Clear  Northumbria University Chris Preist  University of Bristol,In recent years responsible innovation has gained significant traction and can be seen to adorn a myriad of research platforms  education programs  and policy frameworks. In this workshop  we invite HCI researchers to discuss the relations between the CHI community and responsible innovation. This workshop looks to build provocations and principles for and with HCI researchers who are or wish to become responsible innovators. The workshop looks to do this by asking attendees to think about the social  environmental  and economic impacts of ICT and HCI and explore how research innovation frameworks speak to responsible HCI innovation. Through the workshop we look to examine 5 questions to develop a set of provocations and principles  which will help encourage HCI and computer science researchers  educators  and innovators to reflect on the impact of their research and innovation.

While automationsystems have been a realm for highly specialized tasks and trained experts until recently  now moreand more non-expert users encounter automated systems in their everyday life. The deploymentof these systems fundamentally changes practices and experiences in various domains. The overallgoal of this workshop is to investigate the requirements and design criteria for automation that areexperienced in everyday situations. In particular we will strive to come up with a set of principles forthree key areas of everyday automation experience: intelligibility  experienced control  and capturingautomation experience. This way  the workshop provides a first forum for knowledge exchange andnetworking across usage domains and contexts.
71,Computational Modeling in Human-Computer Interaction,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Carron 1,Nikola Banovic  University of Michigan Antti Oulasvirta  Aalto University Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge,We propose a workshop on rapidly emerging topic of Computational Modeling in HCI to address the challenges of increasing complexity of human behaviors we are able to track and collect today. The goal of this workshop is to reconcile two seemingly competing approaches to computational modeling: theoretical modeling  which seeks to explain behaviors vs. algorithmic modeling  which seeks to predict behaviors. The workshop will address: 1) convergence of the two approaches at the intersection of HCI  2) updates to theoretical and methodological foundations  3) bringing disparate modeling communities to CHI  and 4) sharing datasets  code  and best practices. This workshop seeks to establish Computational Modeling as a theoretical foundation for work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to model the human accurately across domains and support design  optimization  and evaluation of user interfaces to solve a variety of human-centered problems.
72,CHInclusion: Working Toward a More Inclusive HCI Community,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Carron 2,Angelika Strohmayer  Newcastle University Cayley MacArthur  University of Waterloo Velvet Spors  University of Nottingham Michael Muller  IBM Research Morgan Vigil-Hayes  Northern Arizona University Ebtisam Alabdulqader  King Saud University & Newcastle University,HCI has a growing body of work regarding important social and community issues  as well as various grassroots communities working to make CHI more international and inclusive. In this workshop  we will build on this work: first reflecting on the contemporary CHI climate  and then developing an actionable plan towards making CHI2019 and subsequent SIGCHI events and sister conferences more inclusive for all.
73,The Body as Starting Point: Applying Inside Body Knowledge for Inbodied Design,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Castle 1 CROWNE,Josh Andres  IBM Research & Exertion Games Lab and RMIT m.c. schraefel  University of Southampton Aaron Tabor  University of New Brunswick Eric B. Hekler  University of California  San Diego,Inbodied design is an emerging area in HCI that focuses on using knowledge of the body's internal systems and processes to better inform em-bodied and circum-bodied design spaces. The current challenge in developing an inbodied approach to HCI research/design is domain expertise: accessing sufficient and appropriate information about how the body itself works and how the body's different systems interact dynamically. In this workshop  we review and build on last year's introduction to inbodied foundations  focusing on applying inbodied knowledge to design challenges to explore (1) the foundational pillars of the inbodied design approach  and (2) how inbodied knowledge can affect / alter our understanding of em-bodied and circum-bodied design challenges and better inform design decisions. Our aim with this hands-on and cross-domain workshop is for HCI researchers to create innovative designs taking the body as a starting point
74,Sensitive Research  Practice and Design in HCI,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Castle 2 CROWNE,Stevie Chancellor  Georgia Tech Nazanin Andalibi  University of Michigan Lindsay Blackwell  University of Michigan David Nemer  University of Kentucky Wendy Moncur  University of Dundee,New research areas in HCI examine complex and sensitive research areas  such as crisis  life transitions  and mental health. Further  research in complex topics such as harassment and graphic content can leave researchers vulnerable to emotional and physical harm. There is a need to bring researchers together to discuss challenges across sensitive research spaces and environments. We propose a workshop to explore the methodological  ethical  and emotional challenges of sensitive research in HCI. We will actively recruit from diverse research environments (industry  academia  government  etc.) and methods areas (qualitative  quantitative  design practices  etc.) and identify commonalities in and encourage relationship-building between these areas. This one-day workshop will be led by academic and industry researchers with diverse methods  topical  and employment experiences.
75,Conversational Agents: Acting on the Wave of Research and Development,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Castle 3 CROWNE,Richard Jacques  Microsoft Asbjørn Følstad  SINTEF Elizabeth Gerber  Northwestern University Jonathan Grudin  Microsoft Ewa Luger  Edinburgh University Andrés Monroy-Hernández  Snap Inc. Dakuo Wang  IBM T.J. Watson Research Center,In the last five years  work on software that interacts with people via typed or spoken natural language  called chatbots  intelligent assistants  social bots  virtual companions  non-human players  and so on  increased dramatically. Chatbots burst into prominence in 2016. Then came a wave of research  more development  and some use. The time is right to assess what we have learned from endeavouring to build conversational user interfaces that simulate quasi-human partners engaged in real conversations with real people. This workshop brings together people who developed or studied various conversational agents  to explore themes that include what works (and hasn't) in home  education  healthcare  and work settings  what we have learned from this about people and their activities  and social or ethical possibilities for good or risk.

Alavi  University of Fribourg Silvia Lindtner  University of Michigan Ding Wang  Microsoft Research,We invite scholars  designers  developers  policymakers and provocateurs to explore non-standard  global and virtual work futures  to reflect on the impact of new sites and temporal patterns of work  and to consider emerging interpersonal and person-machine dynamics within work. We will frame these discussions with a consideration of the relationship between the future of work and existing modes of labor and political economy  with a view to identifying possibilities for both technological innovation and systemic change.
77,CHI4EVIL: Creative Speculation on the Negative Impacts of HCI Research,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Dochart 2,Robert Soden  University of Colorado Michael Skirpan  Carnegie Melon University Casey Fiesler  University of Colorado Zahra Ashktorab  IBM Research Eric P. S. Baumer  Lehigh University Mark Blythe  Northumbria University Jasmine Jones  University of Minnesota,The HCI community is experiencing a resurgence of interest in the ethical  social  and political dimensions of HCI research and practice. Despite increased attention to these issues is not always clear that our community has the tools or training to adequately think through some of the complex issues that these commitments raise. In this workshop  we will explore the creative use of HCI methods and concepts such as design fiction or speculative design to help anticipate and reflect on the potential downsides of our technology design  research  and implementation. How can these tools help us to critique some of the assumptions  metaphors  and patterns that drive our field forward? Can we  by intentionally adopting the personas of would-be evil-doers  learn something about how better to accomplish HCI for Good?
78,All the World (Wide Web)'s a Stage: A Workshop on Live Streaming,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Fyne,Raquel Breejon Robinson  University of Saskatchewan Jessica Hammer  Carnegie Mellon University Katherine Isbister  University of California Santa Cruz,With the rise of live streaming and esports in recent years  it becomes increasingly important for the HCI community to understand this phenomenon. The organizers encourage people to submit papers with novel interfaces they wish to explore in a live streaming context. In this workshop  participants will discuss different facets of the live streaming experience and obtain a greater understanding of the culture that exists on streaming platforms like Twitch. They will then participate in a design exercise  forming groups and iterating on a design together. Discussion/design topics will include ideas encouraging audience participation  moderation of toxicity  and other such topics. Participants will leave the workshop with ideas about how they can better design games and other experiences taking the live streaming ecosystem into consideration.
79,Addressing the Challenges of Situationally-Induced Impairments and Disabilities in Mobile Interaction,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Gala 1,Garreth W. Tigwell  University of Dundee Zhanna Sarsenbayeva  University of Melbourne Benjamin M. Gorman  Bournemouth University David R. Flatla  University of Guelph Jorge Goncalves  University of Melbourne Yeliz Yesilada  Middle East Technical University Northern Cyprus Campus Jacob O. Wobbrock  University of Washington,Situationally-induced impairments and disabilities (SIIDs) make it difficult for users of interactive computing systems to perform tasks due to context (e.g.  listening to a phone call when in a noisy crowd) rather than a result of a congenital or acquired impairment (e.g.  hearing damage). SIIDs are a great concern when considering the ubiquitousness of technology in a wide range of contexts. Considering our daily reliance on technology  and mobile technology in particular  it is increasingly important that we fully understand and model how SIIDs occur. Similarly  we must identify appropriate methods for sensing and adapting technology to reduce the effects of SIIDs. In this workshop  we will bring together researchers working on understanding  sensing  modelling  and adapting technologies to ameliorate the effects of SIIDs. This workshop will provide a venue to identify existing research gaps  new directions for future research  and opportunities for future collaboration.
80,Mid-Air Haptic Interfaces for Interactive Digital Signage and Kiosks,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Gala 2,Orestis Georgiou  Ultrahaptics Hannah Limerick  Ultrahaptics Loïc Corenthy  Ultrahaptics Mark Perry  Brunel University London Mykola Maksymenko  Softserve Sam Frish  Softserve Jörg Müller  University of Bayreuth Myroslav Bachynskyi  Bayreuth University Jin Ryong Kim  Alibaba Group,Digital signage systems are transitioning from static displays to rich  dynamic interactive experiences while new enabling technologies that support these interactions are also evolving. For instance  advances in computer vision and face  gaze  facial expression  body and hand-gesture recognition have enabled new ways of distal interactivity with digital content. Such possibilities are only just being adopted by advertisers and retailers  yet  they face important challenges e.g. the lack of a commonly accepted gesture  facial expressions or call-to-action set. Another common issue here is the absence of active tactile stimuli. Mid-air haptic interfaces can help alleviate these problems and aid in defining a gesture set  informing users about their interaction via haptic feedback loops  and enhancing the overall user experience. This workshop aims to examine the possibilities opened up by these technologies and discuss opportunities in designing the next generation of interactive digital signage kiosks.
81,HCI for Accurate  Impartial and Transparent Journalism: Challenges and Solutions,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Island A CROWNE,Tanja Aitamurto  Northwestern Mike Ananny  University of Southern California Chris W. Anderson  University of Leeds Larry Birnbaum  Northwestern University Nicholas Diakopoulos  Northwestern University Matilda Hanson  Dagens Nyheter Jessica Hullman  Northwestern Nick Ritchie  BBC,While new media technologies hold the potential to serve journalism's dual goals of informing and engaging the public  these technologies also challenge the journalistic norms of accuracy  impartiality and transparency. The key question in this workshop is: How can HCI support accurate  impartial and transparent journalism? This question is ever more timely as the need for accurate and credible journalism is growing amid the proliferation of disinformation and opinion manipulation. In this workshop  we will identify challenges and solutions in the design of user interfaces  user experiences and production processes in journalism. We bring together researchers and practitioners designing  deploying and studying new technologies in journalism. The goal of the workshop is to harness the potential of HCI for supporting accurate  impartial and transparent journalism.
82,New Directions for the IoT: Automate  Share  Build  and Care,Sunday  May 05  2019 - 09:00:00,Sunday  May 05  2019 17:00,Island B CROWNE,Carolina Fuentes  University of Nottingham Martin Porcheron  University of Nottingham Joel Fischer  University of Nottingham Enrico Costanza  University College London Nervo Verdezoto  University of Leicester Valeria Herskovic  Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile Oren Zuckerman  The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya Leila Takayama  University of California  Santa Cruz,As the IoT is taking hold in the home  in healthcare  factories  and industry  new challenges and approaches arise for HCI research and design. For example  HCI is exploring agency delegation and automation to support the user in managing the deluge of IoT data  make decisions  or even take actions on behalf of the user  while economic models are being proposed to drive sharing economy services. This creates new problems including how to design appropriate solutions for uncertain and dynamic human behaviour  how to ensure resources are distributed fairly  and how to ensure that the user can understand system actions and ultimately remains in control. These issues are becoming more pertinent as the IoT diversifies into safety-critical domains such as manufacturing and healthcare. This one-day workshop intends to bring together the CHI community to explore the interactional  socio-cultural  ethical  and practical challenges and approaches that these new domains raise for the IoT. With this  we want to consider how such approaches could be integrated to achieve more sustainable  inclusive  or effective interactions.

Moore  University of Sheffield Jens Edlund  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Eva Szekely  KTH Royal Institute of Technology Patrick Healey  Queen Mary University of London Naomi Harte  Trinity College Dublin Ilaria Torre  Trinity College Dublin Philip Doyle  Voysis Ltd.,The use of speech as an interaction modality has grown considerably through the integration of Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs- e.g. Siri  Google Assistant) into smartphones and voice based devices (e.g. Amazon Echo). However  there remain significant gaps in using theoretical frameworks to understand user behaviours and choices and how they may applied to specific speech interface interactions. This part-day multidisciplinary workshop aims to critically map out and evaluate theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches across a number of disciplines and establish directions for new paradigms in understanding speech interface user behaviour. In doing so  we will bring together participants from HCI and other speech related domains to establish a cohesive  diverse and collaborative community of researchers from academia and industry with interest in exploring theoretical and methodological issues in the field.

New immersive technologies present many opportunities for enhancing humans' experiences with data interaction  but also present many challenges  a subset of which are specific to the analytics domain. This workshop is centered around a set of group prototyping sessions  aimed at identifying new approaches to existing design challenges. In addition to giving perspective on opportunities and difficulties faced by future designers  these exercises will also explore new prototyping methods and tools for the design of interactive data-centric interfaces. This part-day workshop aims to build new ties between the existing immersive analytics community with researchers across many disciplines of the CHI community.

93,SeeingVR: A Set of Tools to Make Virtual Reality More Accessible to People with Low Vision,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Yuhang Zhao  Cornell Tech & Microsoft Research Edward Cutrell  Microsoft Research Christian Holz  Microsoft Research Meredith Ringel Morris  Microsoft Research Eyal Ofek  Microsoft Research Andrew D. Wilson  Microsoft Research,Current virtual reality applications do not support people who have low vision  i.e.  vision loss that falls short of complete blindness but is not correctable by glasses. We present SeeingVR  a set of 14 tools that enhance a VR application for people with low vision by providing visual and audio augmentations. A user can select  adjust  and combine different tools based on their preferences. Nine of our tools modify an existing VR application post hoc via a plugin without developer effort. The rest require simple inputs from developers using a Unity toolkit we created that allows integrating all 14 of our low vision support tools during development. Our evaluation with 11 participants with low vision showed that SeeingVR enabled users to better enjoy VR and complete tasks more quickly and accurately. Developers also found our Unity toolkit easy and convenient to use.
94,Virtual Showdown: An Accessible Virtual Reality Game with Scaffolds for Youth with Visual Impairments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Ryan Wedoff  Microsoft Lindsay Ball  The College at Brockport  State University of New York Amelia Wang  University of Washington Yi Xuan Khoo  University of Iowa Lauren Lieberman  The College at Brockport  State University of New York Kyle K. Rector  University of Iowa,Virtual Reality (VR) is a growing source of entertainment  but people who are visually impaired have not been effectively included. Audio cues are motivated as a complement to visuals  making experiences more immersive  but are not a primary cue. To address this  we implemented a VR game called Virtual Showdown. We based Virtual Showdown on an accessible real-world game called Showdown  where people use their hearing to locate and hit a ball against an opponent. Further  we developed Verbal and Verbal/Vibration Scaffolds to teach people how to play Virtual Showdown. We assessed the acceptability of Virtual Showdown and compared our scaffolds in an empirical study with 34 youth who are visually impaired. Thirty-three participants wanted to play Virtual Showdown again  and we learned that participants scored higher with the Verbal Scaffold or if they had prior Showdown experience. Our empirical findings inform the design of future accessible VR experiences.
95,Examining Augmented Virtuality Impairment Simulation for Mobile App Accessibility Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo  Singapore Management University Rajesh Krishna Balan  Singapore Management University Youngki Lee  Seoul National University,With mobile apps rapidly permeating all aspects of daily living with use by all segments of the population  it is crucial to support the evaluation of app usability for specific impaired users to improve app accessibility. In this work  we examine the effects of using our augmented virtuality impairment simulation system--Empath-D--to support experienced designer-developers to redesign a mockup of commonly used mobile application for cataract-impaired users  comparing this with existing tools that aid designing for accessibility. We show that the use of augmented virtuality for assessing usability supports enhanced usability challenge identification  finding more defects and doing so more accurately than with existing methods. Through our user interviews  we also show that augmented virtuality impairment simulation supports realistic interaction and evaluation to provide a concrete understanding over the usability challenges that impaired users face  and complements the existing guidelines-based approaches meant for general accessibility.
96,The Effect of Field-of-View Restriction on Sex Bias in VR Sickness and Spatial Navigation Performance,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 1,Majed Al Zayer  University of Nevada Isayas B. Adhanom  University of Nevada Paul MacNeilage  University of Nevada Eelke Folmer  University of Nevada,Recent studies show that women are more susceptible to visually-induced VR sickness  which might explain the low adoption rate of VR technology among women. Reducing field-of-view (FOV) during locomotion is already a widely used strategy to reduce VR sickness as it blocks peripheral optical flow perception and mitigates visual/vestibular conflict. Prior studies show that men are more adept at 3D spatial navigation than women  though this sex bias can be minimized by providing women with a larger FOV. Our study provides insight into the relationship between sex and FOV restriction with respect to VR sickness and spatial navigation performance which seem to conflict. We find the use of an FOV restrictor to be effective in mitigating VR sickness in both sexes while we did not find a negative effect of FOV restriction on spatial navigation performance.
97,Shape Structuralizer: Design  Fabrication  and User-driven Iterative Refinement of 3D Mesh Models,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Subramanian Chidambaram  Purdue University Yunbo Zhang  Rochester Institute of Technology Venkatraghavan Sundararajan  Purdue university Niklas Elmqvist  University of Maryland  College Park Karthik Ramani  Purdue University,Current Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools lack proper support for guiding novice users towards designs ready for fabrication. We propose Shape Structuralizer (SS)  an interactive design support system that repurposes surface models into structural constructions using rods and custom 3D-printed joints. Shape Structuralizer embeds a recommendation system that computationally supports the user during design ideation by providing design suggestions on local refinements of the design. This strategy enables novice users to choose designs that both satisfy stress constraints as well as their personal design intent. The interactive guidance enables users to repurpose existing surface mesh models  analyze them in-situ for stress and displacement constraints  add movable joints to increase functionality  and attach a customized appearance. This also empowers novices to fabricate even complex constructs while ensuring structural soundness. We validate the Shape Structuralizer tool with a qualitative user study where we observed that even novice users were able to generate a large number of structurally safe designs for fabrication.
98,JigFab: Computational Fabrication of Constraints to Facilitate Woodworking with Power Tools,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Danny Leen  Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Tom Veuskens  Hasselt University Kris Luyten  Hasselt University - tUL - Flanders Make Raf Ramakers  Hasselt University,We present JigFab  an integrated end-to-end system that supports casual makers in designing and fabricating constructions with power tools. Starting from a digital version of the construction  JigFab achieves this by generating various types of constraints that configure and physically aid the movement of a power tool. Constraints are generated for every operation and are custom to the work piece. Constraints are laser cut and assembled together with predefined parts to reduce waste. JigFab's constraints are used according to an interactive step-by-step manual. JigFab internalizes all the required domain knowledge for designing and building intricate structures  consisting of various types of finger joints  tenon & mortise joints  grooves  and dowels. Building such structures is normally reserved for artisans or automated with advanced CNC machinery.
99,Digital Fabrication of Soft Actuated Objects by Machine Knitting,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Lea Albaugh  Carnegie Mellon University Scott Hudson  Carnegie Mellon University Lining Yao  Carnegie Mellon University,With recent interest in shape-changing interfaces  material-driven design  wearable technologies  and soft robotics  digital fabrication of soft actuatable material is increasingly in demand. Much of this research focuses on elastomers or non-stretchy air bladders. Computationally-controlled machine knitting offers an alternative fabrication technology which can rapidly produce soft textile objects that have a very different character: breathable  lightweight  and pleasant to the touch. These machines are well established and optimized for the mass production of garments  but compared to other digital fabrication techniques such as CNC machining or 3D printing  they have received much less attention as general purpose fabrication devices. In this work  we explore new ways to employ machine knitting for the creation of actuated soft objects. We describe the basic operation of this type of machine  then show new techniques for knitting tendon-based actuation into objects. We explore a series of design strategies for integrating tendons with shaping and anisotropic texture design. Finally  we investigate different knit material properties  including considerations for motor control and sensing.
100,Understanding Metamaterial Mechanisms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Alsh 2,Alexandra Ion  Hasso Plattner Institute David Lindlbauer  Technische Universität Berlin & ETH Zurich Philipp Herholz  Technische Universität Berlin Marc Alexa  Technische Universität Berlin Patrick Baudisch  Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam ,In this paper  we establish the underlying foundations of mechanisms that are composed of cell structures---known as metamaterial mechanisms. Such metamaterial mechanisms were previously shown to implement complete mechanisms in the cell structure of a 3D printed material  without the need for assembly. However  their design is highly challenging. A mechanism consists of many cells that are interconnected and impose constraints on each other. This leads to unobvious and non-linear behavior of the mechanism  which impedes user design. In this work  we investigate the underlying topological constraints of such cell structures and their influence on the resulting mechanism. Based on these findings  we contribute a computational design tool that automatically creates a metamaterial mechanism from user-defined motion paths. This tool is only feasible because our novel abstract representation of the global constraints highly reduces the search space of possible cell arrangements.
101,Towards Metrics of Meaningfulness for Tech Practitioners,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Vanessa Julia Carpenter  IdemoLab  FORCE Technology & Aalborg University Elisa D. Mekler  University of Basel,HCI and the tech industry are increasingly interested in designing products that afford meaningful user experiences. Yet while several metrics of meaningfulness have been suggested  their utility and relevance for industry is unclear. We conducted workshops with 9 welfare technology companies and presented them with different metrics from existing literature in HCI  psychology  and industry  to evaluate their product and consider how relevant designing for meaningfulness is for them in their practice. We point to four metrics which companies considered particularly relevant  and suggest that further defining metrics of meaningfulness in HCI would be beneficial to both academia and industry.
102,Designing an Informal Learning Curriculum to Develop 3D Modeling Knowledge and Improve Spatial Thinking Skills,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Srinjita Bhaduri  University of Colorado Boulder Katie Van Horne  University of Colorado Boulder Tamara Sumner  University of Colorado Boulder,We report on the design and implementation of a 3-week long summer academy introducing high school students to 3D modeling and 3D printing experiences. Supporting youth in developing 3D modeling knowledge can enhance their capacity to effectively use an array of emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality  Augmented Reality  and digital fabrication. We used tools and practices from both formal and informal education  such as storylining  to inform the design of the curriculum. We collected data through surveys  artifacts  observations  screen recordings  and group videos. Our findings suggest that (1) emphasizing curricular coherence as a design goal and (2) providing youth with multiple avenues for engaging in 3D modeling can help to: spark youth interest in 3D printing/modeling  maintain youth engagement in learning activities over the course of several weeks  and provide youth with opportunities to develop their spatial thinking skills.

This program focused on generating a Single Usability Metric (SUM) score across products over time but encountered a number of issues including error rate reliability  challenges establishing objective time-on-task targets  and scale anchoring. These issues contributed to making SUM difficult to communicate  prompting exploration of an alternative single usability metric using simple thresholds developed from anchor text and inter-metric correlations.

Kyle Pedersen  Google Inc.,Measuring user experience (UX) is an important part of the design process  yet there are few methods to evaluate UX in the early phases of product development. We introduce Triptech  a method used to quickly explore novel product ideas. We present how it was used to gauge the frequency and importance of user needs  to assess the desirability and perceived usefulness of design concepts  and to draft UX requirements for Now Playing—an on-device music recognition system for the Pixel 2. We discuss the merits and limitations of the Triptech method and its applicability to tech-driven innovation practices.

What information can the visual system effortlessly extract  and what requires slower  more cognitive processes? What does eye-tracking data tell us about what users perceive? Vision scientists have recently made ground-breaking progress in understanding many aspects of vision that are key to good design. A critical determining factor is what information is available at a glance. This course reviews state-of-the-art vision science  including a computational model that visualizes the available information. We will demonstrate use of this model in evaluating and guiding visual designs.

107,NaviBike: Comparing Unimodal Navigation Cues for Child Cyclists,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Andrii Matviienko  OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology Swamy Ananthanarayan  University of Oldenburg Abdallah El Ali  Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) Wilko Heuten  OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology Susanne Boll  University of Oldenburg,Navigation systems for cyclists are commonly screen-based devices mounted on the handlebar which show map information. Typically  adult cyclists have to explicitly look down for directions. This can be distracting and challenging for children  given their developmental differences in motor and perceptual-motor abilities compared with adults. To address this issue  we designed different unimodal cues and explored their suitability for child cyclists through two experiments. In the first experiment  we developed an indoor bicycle simulator and compared auditory  light  and vibrotactile navigation cues. In the second experiment  we investigated these navigation cues in-situ in an outdoor practice test track using a mid-size tricycle. To simulate road distractions  children were given an additional auditory task in both experiments. We found that auditory navigational cues were the most understandable and the least prone to navigation errors. However  light and vibrotactile cues might be useful for educating younger child cyclists.
108,At Your Service: Designing Voice Assistant Personalities to Improve Automotive User Interfaces: A Real World Driving Study,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Michael Braun  BMW Group Research  New Technologies  Innovations & Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Anja Mainz  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Ronee Chadowitz  BMW Group Research  New Technologies  Innovations Bastian Pfleging  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Florian Alt  Bundeswehr University Munich & Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich,This paper investigates personalized voice characters for in-car speech interfaces. In particular  we report on how we designed different personalities for voice assistants and compared them in a real world driving study. Voice assistants have become important for a wide range of use cases  yet current interfaces are using the same style of auditory response in every situation  despite varying user needs and personalities.To close this gap  we designed four assistant personalities (Friend  Admirer  Aunt  and Butler) and compared them to a baseline (Default) in a between-subject study in real traffic conditions. Our results show higher likability and trust for assistants that correctly match the user's personality while we observed lower likability  trust  satisfaction  and usefulness for incorrectly matched personalities  each in comparison with the Default character. We discuss design aspects for voice assistants in different automotive use cases.
109,In UX We Trust: Investigation of Aesthetics and Usability of Driver-Vehicle Interfaces and Their Impact on the Perception of Automated Driving,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Anna-Katharina Frison  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University Philipp Wintersberger  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University Andreas Riener  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt Clemens Schartmüller  Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt & Johannes Kepler University Linda Ng Boyle  University of Washington Erika Miller  Colorado State University Klemens Weigl  Katholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt & Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt,In the evolution of technical systems  freedom from error and early adoption plays a major role for market success and to maintain competitiveness. In the case of automated driving  we see that faulty systems are put into operation and users trust these systems  often without any restrictions. Trust and use are often associated with users' experience of the driver-vehicle interfaces and interior design. In this work  we present the results of our investigations on factors that influence the perception of automated driving. In a simulator study  N=48 participants had to drive a SAE level 2 vehicle with either perfect or faulty driving function. As a secondary activity  participants had to solve tasks on an infotainment system with varying aesthetics and usability (2x2). Results reveal that the interaction of conditions significantly influences trust and UX of the vehicle system. Our conclusion is that all aspects of vehicle design cumulate to system and trust perception.
110,PicMe: Interactive Visual Guidance for Taking Requested Photo Composition,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 1,Minju Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Jungjin Lee  KAI Inc.,PicMe is a mobile application that provides interactive on-screen guidance that helps the user take pictures of a composition that another person requires. Once the requester captures a picture of the desired composition and delivers it to the user (photographer)  a 2.5D guidance system  called the virtual frame  guides the user in real-time by showing a three-dimensional composition of the target image (i.e.  size and shape). In addition  according to the matching accuracy rate  we provide a small-sized target image in an inset window as feedback and edge visualization for further alignment of the detail elements. We implemented PicMe to work fully in mobile environments. We then conducted a preliminary user study to evaluate the effectiveness of PicMe compared to traditional 2D guidance methods. The results show that PicMe helps users reach their target images more accurately and quickly by giving participants more confidence in their tasks.
111,How to Design Voice Based Navigation for How-To Videos,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Minsuk Chang  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Anh Truong  Adobe Research Oliver Wang  Adobe Research Maneesh Agrawala  Stanford University Juho Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,When watching how-to videos related to physical tasks  users' hands are often occupied by the task  making voice input a natural fit. To better understand the design space of voice interactions for how-to video navigation  we conducted three think-aloud studies using: 1) a traditional video interface  2) a research probe providing a voice controlled video interface  and 3) a wizard-of-oz interface. From the studies  we distill seven navigation objectives and their underlying intents: pace control pause  content alignment pause  video control pause  reference jump  replay jump  skip jump  and peek jump. Our analysis found that users' navigation objectives and intents affect the choice of referent type and referencing approach in command utterances. Based on our findings  we recommend to 1) support conversational strategies like sequence expansions and command queues  2) allow users to identify and refine their navigation objectives explicitly  and 3) support the seven interaction intents.
112,B-Script: Transcript-based B-roll Video Editing with Recommendations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Bernd Huber  Harvard University Hijung Valentina Shin  Adobe Research Bryan Russell  Adobe Research Oliver Wang  Adobe Research Gautham J. Mysore  Adobe Research,In video production  inserting B-roll is a widely used technique to enrich the story and make a video more engaging. However  determining the right content and positions of B-roll and actually inserting it within the main footage can be challenging  and novice producers often struggle to get both timing and content right. We present B-Script  a system that supports B-roll video editing via interactive transcripts. B-Script has a built-in recommendation system trained on expert-annotated data  recommending users B-roll position and content. To evaluate the system  we conducted a within-subject user study with 110 participants  and compared three interface variations: a timeline-based editor  a transcript-based editor  and a transcript-based editor with recommendations. Users found it easier and were faster to insert B-roll using the transcript-based interface  and they created more engaging videos when recommendations were provided.
113,TutoriVR: A Video-Based Tutorial System for Design Applications in Virtual Reality,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Balasaravanan Thoravi Kumaravel  University of California  Berkeley Cuong Nguyen  Adobe Research Stephen DiVerdi  Adobe Research Björn Hartmann  University of California  Berkeley,Virtual Reality painting is a form of 3D-painting done in a Virtual Reality (VR) space. Being a relatively new kind of art form  there is a growing interest within the creative practices community to learn it. Currently  most users learn using community posted 2D-videos on the internet  which are a screencast recording of the painting process by an instructor. While such an approach may suffice for teaching 2D-software tools  these videos by themselves fail in delivering crucial details that required by the user to understand actions in a VR space. We conduct a formative study to identify challenges faced by users in learning to VR-paint using such video-based tutorials. Informed by results of this study  we develop a VR-embedded tutorial system that supplements video tutorials with 3D and contextual aids directly in the user's VR environment. An exploratory evaluation showed users were positive about the system and were able to use the proposed system to recreate painting tasks in VR.
114,Interactive Body-Driven Graphics for Augmented Video Performance,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Boisdale 2,Nazmus Saquib  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Rubaiat Habib Kazi  Adobe Research Li-Yi Wei  Adobe Research Wilmot Li  Adobe,We present a system that augments live presentation videos with interactive graphics to create a powerful and expressive storytelling environment. Using our system  the presenter interacts with the graphical elements in real-time with gestures and postures  thus leveraging our innate  everyday skills to enhance our communication capabilities with the audience. However  crafting such an interactive and expressive performance typically requires programming  or highly-specialized tools tailored for experts. Our core contribution is a flexible  direct manipulation UI which enables amateurs and experts to craft such presentations beforehand by mapping a variety of body movements to a wide range of graphical manipulations. By simplifying the mapping between gestures  postures  and their corresponding output effects  our UI enables users to craft customized  rich interactions with the graphical elements. Our user study demonstrates the potential usage and unique affordance of this mixed-reality medium for storytelling and presentation across a range of application domains.
115,Patient Perspectives on Self-Management Technologies for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Tabby Davies  University of Bath Simon L. Jones  University of Bath Ryan M. Kelly  The University of Melbourne,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating medical condition that is characterized by a range of physical  cognitive and social impairments. This paper investigates CFS patients' perspectives on the potential for technological support for self-management of their symptoms. We report findings from three studies in which people living with CFS 1) prioritized symptoms that they would like technologies to address  2) articulated their current approaches to self-management alongside challenges they face  and 3) reflected on their experiences with three commercial smartphone apps related to symptom management. We contribute an understanding of the specific needs of the ME/CFS population and the ways in which they currently engage in self-management using technology. The paper ends by describing five high-level design recommendations for ME/CFS self-management technologies.
116,Tricky to get your head around: Information Work of People Managing Chronic Kidney Disease in the UK,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Eleanor R. Burgess  Northwestern University Madhu C. Reddy  Northwestern University Andrew Davenport  Royal Free Hospital Paul Laboi  York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Ann Blandford  University College London,People diagnosed with a chronic health condition have many information needs which healthcare providers  patient groups  and resource designers seek to support. However  as a disease progresses  knowing when  how  and for what purposes patients want to interact with and construct personal meaning from health-related information is still unclear. This paper presents findings regarding the information work of chronic kidney disease patients. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 patients and 6 clinicians  and observations at 9 patient group events. We used the stages of the information journey – recognizing need  seeking  interpreting  and using information – to frame our data analysis. We identified two distinct but often overlapping information work phases  'Learning' and 'Living With' a chronic condition to show how patient information work activities shift over time. We also describe social and individual factors influencing information work  and discuss technology design opportunities including customized education and collaboration tools.
117,Supporting Communication About Values Between People with Multiple Chronic Conditions and their Providers,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Andrew B. L. Berry  University of Washington Catherine Y. Lim  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute Tad Hirsch  Northeastern University Andrea L. Hartzler  University of Washington Linda M. Kiel  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute Zoë A. Bermet  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute James D. Ralston  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute,People with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) often disagree with healthcare providers on priorities for care  leading to worse health outcomes. To align priorities  there is a need to support patient-provider communication about what patients consider important for their well-being and health (i.e.  their personal values). To address barriers to communication about values  we conducted a two-part study with key stakeholders in MCC care: patients  informal caregivers  and providers. In Part I  co-design activities generated seven dimensions that characterize stakeholders' diverse ideas for supporting communication about values: explicitness  effort  disclosure  guidance  intimacy  scale  and synchrony. In Part II  we used the dimensions to generate three design concepts and presented them in focus groups to further scrutinize findings from Part I. Based on these findings we outline directions for research and design to improve patient-provider communication about patients' personal values.
118,Facilitating Self-reflection about Values and Self-care Among Individuals with Chronic Conditions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 1,Catherine Y. Lim  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute Andrew B. L. Berry  University of Washington Andrea L. Hartzler  University of Washington Tad Hirsch  Northeastern University David S. Carrell  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute Zoë A. Bermet  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute James D. Ralston  Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute,Individuals with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) experience the overwhelming burden of treating MCC and frequently disagree with their providers on priorities for care. Aligning self-care with patients' values may improve healthcare for these patients. However  patients' values are not routinely discussed in clinical conversations and patients may not actively share this information with providers. In a qualitative field study  we interviewed 15 patients in their homes to investigate techniques that encourage patients to articulate values  self-care  and how they relate. Study activities facilitated self-reflection on values and self-care and produced varying responses  including: raising consciousness  evolving perspectives  identifying misalignments  and considering changes. We discuss how our findings extend prior work on supporting reflection in HCI and inform the design of tools for improving care for people with MCC.
119,The Continued Prevalence of Dichotomous Inferences at CHI,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Lonni Besançon  Linköping University Pierre Dragicevic  Inria,Dichotomous inference is the classification of statistical evidence as either sufficient or insufficient. It is most commonly done through null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Although predominant  dichotomous inferences have proven to cause countless problems. Thus  an increasing number of methodologists have been urging researchers to recognize the continuous nature of statistical evidence and to ban dichotomous inferences. We wanted to see whether they have had any influence on CHI. Our analysis of CHI proceedings from the past nine years suggests that they have not.
120,How we Guide  Write  and Cite at CHI,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Henning Pohl  University of Copenhagen Aske Mottelson  University of Copenhagen,There are many opinions on how to write an influential CHI paper  ranging from writing in an active voice to including colons in the title. However  little is known about how we actually write  and how writing influences impact. We conducted quantitative analyses of the full text of all 6578 CHI papers published since 1982 to investigate. We looked at readability  titles  novelty  and name-dropping and related these measures to the papers' citation count; overall and for different subcommittees. We found that CHI papers are more readable than papers from other fields. Furthermore  readability  title length  and novelty markers all influence citation counts.
121,We Did It Right  But It Was Still Wrong: Toward Assets-Based Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Lucy Pei  University of California  Irvine Bonnie Nardi  University of California  Irvine,"HCI interventions often fall short of delivering lasting impact in resource-constrained contexts. We reflect on a project where we followed the ""right"" steps of needs-based  human-centered design  yet failed to deliver impact to the community. We introduce a framework that evaluates an intervention's potential for sustainable impact by maximizing use of assets in the community and minimizing novelty. We propose assets-based design as an approach that starts with what a community has  leveraging those assets in a design  as opposed to a needs-based approach that focuses on adding what a community lacks."
122,Bringing Shades of Feminism to Human-Centered Computing,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Carron 2,Manasee Narvilkar  Georgia Institute of Technology Josiah Mangiameli  Georgia Institute of Technology Adriana Alvarado Garcia  Georgia Institute of Technology Azra Ismail  Georgia Institute of Technology Daniel Schiff  Georgia Institute of Technology Danielle Schechter  Georgia Institute of Technology Jordan Chen  Georgia Institute of Technology Karthik Bhat  Georgia Institute of Technology Marisol Wong-Villacres  Georgia Institute of Technology Anusha Vasudeva  Georgia Institute of Technology Aparna Ramesh  Georgia Institute of Technology Michaelanne Dye  Georgia Institute of Technology Naveena Karusala  University of Washington Pragati Singh  Georgia Institute of Technology Savanthi Murthy  Georgia Institute of Technology Shubhangi Gupta  Georgia Institute of Technology Udaya Lakshmi  Georgia Institute of Technology Neha Kumar  Georgia Institute of Technology,This consolidation of 18 stories from students and researchers of human-centered computing (HCC) represent some of the diverse shades of feminism that are present in our field. These stories  our stories  reflect how we see the world and why  also articulating the change we wish to bring.

Sketches are fast  easy to create  and – by varying their fidelity – can be used in all areas of HCI. Sketching in HCI will explore and demonstrate themes around sketching in HCI with the aim of producing tangible outputs. Attendees will leave the course with the confidence to engage actively with sketching on an everyday basis in their research practice.
124,How to Write CHI Papers (Third Edition),Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Lennart E. Nacke  University of Waterloo,We base everything that we do as researchers on what we write. Primarily for graduate students and young researchers  it is hard to turn a research project into a successful CHI publication. This struggle continues for postdocs and young professors trying to author excellent reviews for the CHI community that pinpoint flaws and improvements in research papers. This third edition of the successful CHI paper writing course offers hands-on advice and more in-depth tutorials on how to write papers with clarity  substance  and style. It is structured into three 80-minute units with a focus on writing CHI papers.
125,Making with Fabric: Foundations of Soft Goods and E-Textiles Fabrication,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Lucy E. Dunne  University of Minnesota,Wearable technologies afford more pervasive access to the human user: higher bandwidth for communication in multiple modalities  and better context-awareness through sensing the user's body and environment. However  stand-alone devices like wristbands and clip-ons are limited in the body areas they can simultaneously access. Clothing and textiles provide a useful platform for distributed systems  but present unique challenges in design and fabrication. This course provides an introduction to the tools  methods  and techniques of designing and fabricating with soft goods  including patternmaking and construction techniques for different material types at multiple scales  and e-textile methods and materials.
126,Career Mentoring in Online Communities: Seeking and Receiving Advice from an Online Community,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Maria Tomprou  Carnegie Mellon University Laura Dabbish  Carnegie Mellon University Robert E. Kraut  Carnegie Mellon University Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,Although people frequently seek mentoring or advice for their career  most mentoring is performed in person. Little research has examined the nature and quality of career mentoring online. To address this gap  we study how people use online Q&A forums for career advice. We develop a taxonomy of career advice requests based on a qualitative analysis of posts in a career-related online forum  identifying three key types: best practices  career threats  and time-sensitive requests. Our quantitative analysis of responses shows that both requesters and external viewers value general information  encouragement  and guidance  but not role modeling. We found no relation between the type of requests and features of responses  nor differences in responses valued by requesters versus external viewers. We present design recommendations for supporting online career advice exchange.
127,What Happens After Disclosing Stigmatized Experiences on Identified Social Media: Individual  Dyadic  and Social/Network Outcomes,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Nazanin Andalibi  University of Michigan,Disclosing stigmatized experiences or identity facets on identified social media (e.g.  Facebook) can be risky  inhibited  yet beneficial for the discloser. I investigate such disclosures' outcomes when they do happen on identified social media as perceived by the individuals who perform them. I draw on interviews with women who have experienced pregnancy loss and are social media users in the U.S. I document outcomes at the social/network  individual  and dyad levels. I highlight the powerful role of connecting with others with a similar experience within networks of known ties  how disclosures lead to relationship changes  how disclosers take on new social roles as mentors and support sources  and how helpful connections following disclosures originate from various kinds of ties via diverse communication channels. I emphasize reciprocal disclosures as an outcome contributing to further outcomes (e.g.  destigmatizing pregnancy loss). I provide design implications related to facilitating being a support source and mentor  helpful reciprocal disclosures  and finding similar others within networks of known ties.
128,Communication Breakdowns Between Families and Alexa,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Erin Beneteau  University of Washington Olivia K. Richards  Pennsylvania State University Mingrui Zhang  University of Washington Julie A. Kientz  University of Washington Jason C. Yip  University of Washington Alexis Hiniker  University of Washington,We investigate how families repair communication breakdowns with digital home assistants. We recruited 10 diverse families to use an Amazon Echo Dot in their homes for four weeks. All families had at least one child between four and 17 years old. Each family participated in pre- and post- deployment interviews. Their interactions with the Echo Dot (Alexa) were audio recorded throughout the study. We analyzed 59 communication breakdown interactions between family members and Alexa  framing our analysis with concepts from HCI and speech-language pathology. Our findings indicate that family members collaborate using discourse scaffolding (supportive communication guidance) and a variety of speech and language modifications in their attempts to repair communication breakdowns with Alexa. Alexa's responses also influence the repair strategies that families use. Designers can relieve the communication repair burden that primarily rests with families by increasing digital home assistants' abilities to collaborate together with users to repair communication breakdowns.
129,Nurturing Constructive Disagreement - Agonistic Design with Neurodiverse Children,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Clyde Auditorium,Christopher Frauenberger  TU Wien Katta Spiel  TU Wien Laura Scheepmaker  TU Wien Irene Posch  TU Wien,Participatory design (PD) with heterogeneous groups poses particular challenges  requiring spaces in which different agendas or visions can be negotiated. In this paper we report on our PD work with two groups of neurodiverse children to design technologies that support co-located  social play. The heterogeneity in the groups in terms of abilities  conceptions of play  motivations to be involved and individual preferences has challenged us to think of the design process and its outcomes as spaces for continuous negotiation. Drawing on the notion of agonistic PD  we sought not to necessarily reconcile all views  but foster constructive disagreement as a resource for and possible outcome of design. Using our project work as a case study  we report on controversies  big and small  and how they manifested themselves in the processes and outcomes. Reflecting on our experiences  we discuss possible implications on the notion of democratising technology innovation.
130,Development of a Checklist for the Prevention of Intradialytic Hypotension in Hemodialysis Care: Design Considerations Based on Activity Theory,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Pei-Yi Kuo  University of Michigan & National Tsing Hua University Rajiv Saran  University of Michigan Marissa Argentina  National Kidney Foundation Michael Heung  University of Michigan Jennifer L.

Veinot  University of Michigan,"Hemodialysis is life-saving therapy for end-stage renal disease; yet  20% of hemodialysis sessions are complicated by intradialytic hypotension (""IDH""). There is a need for approaches to preventing IDH that account for their implementation contexts. Using Activity Theory  we outline the design of a digital diagnostic checklist to identify patients at risk of IDH. Checklists were chosen a priori as an outcome due to prior evidence of effectiveness. Drawing on individual interviews with 20 clinicians and three focus groups with 17 patients  we describe four activity systems within hemodialysis care. We then outline a novel design process that includes co-design activities with clinicians  and four rapid-cycle iterations that progressively incorporated activity system elements into checklist design. We contribute a new type of checklist design to HCI: one that supports diagnostic thinking rather than consistent task completion. We further broaden checklist design by including a formal role for patients in checklist completion."
131,Comparing the Effects of Paper and Digital Checklists on Team Performance in Time-Critical Work,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Leah Kulp  Drexel University Aleksandra Sarcevic  Drexel University Megan Cheng  Children's National Medical Center Yinan Zheng  Children's National Medical Center Randall S. Burd  Children's National Medical Center,This mixed-methods study examines the effects of a tablet-based checklist system on team performance during a dynamic and safety-critical process of trauma resuscitation. We compared team performance from 47 resuscitations that used a paper checklist to that from 47 cases with a digital checklist to determine if digitizing a checklist led to improvements in task completion rates and in how fast the tasks were initiated for 18 most critical assessment and treatment tasks. We also compared if the checklist compliance increased with the digital design. We found that using the digital checklist led to more frequent completions of the initial airway assessment task but fewer completions of ear and lower extremities exams. We did not observe any significant differences in time to task performance  but found increased compliance with the checklist. Although improvements in team performance with the digital checklist were minor  our findings are important because they showed no adverse effects as a result of the digital checklist introduction. We conclude by discussing the takeaways and implications of these results for effective digitization of medical work.
132,Cognitive Aids in Acute Care: Investigating How Cognitive Aids Affect and Support In-hospital Emergency Teams,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Tobias Grundgeiger  Julius-Maximilians-University Stephan Huber  Julius-Maximilians-University Daniel Reinhardt  Julius-Maximilians-University Andreas Steinisch  University Hospital of Würzburg Oliver Happel  University Hospital of Würzburg Thomas Wurmb  University Hospital of Würzburg,Cognitive aids – artefacts that support a user in the completion of a task at the time – have raised great interest to support healthcare staff during medical emergencies. However  the mechanisms of how cognitive aids support or affect staff remain understudied. We describe the iterative development of a tablet-based cognitive aid application to support in-hospital resuscitation team leaders. We report a summative evaluation of two different versions of the application. Finally  we outline the limitations of current explanations of how cognitive aids work and suggest an approach based on embodied cognition. We discuss how cognitive aids alter the task of the team leader (distributed cognition)  the importance of the present team situation (socially situated)  and the result of the interaction between mind and environment (sensorimotor coupling). Understanding and considering the implications of introducing cognitive aids may help to increase acceptance and effectiveness of cognitive aids and eventually improve patient safety.
133,Human-Centered Tools for Coping with Imperfect Algorithms During Medical Decision-Making,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 1,Carrie J. Cai  Google Brain Emily Reif  Google Brain Narayan Hegde  Google Brain Jason Hipp  Google Brain Been Kim  Google Brain Daniel Smilkov  Google Brain Martin Wattenberg  Google Brain Fernanda Viegas  Google Brain Greg S. Corrado  Google Brain Martin C. Stumpe  Google Brain Michael Terry  Google Brain,Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in image retrieval systems for medical decision making. One application of ML is to retrieve visually similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. However  no algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. In this paper  we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images retrieved using a deep learning algorithm  and developed tools that empower users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly  communicating what types of similarity are most important at different moments in time. In two evaluations with pathologists  we found that these tools increased the diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm. The tools were preferred over a traditional interface  without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. We also observed that users adopted new strategies when using refinement tools  re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying algorithm and to disambiguate ML errors from their own errors. Taken together  these findings inform future human-ML collaborative systems for expert decision-making.
134,(Re-)Framing Menopause Experiences for HCI and Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Jeffrey Bardzell  Indiana University Shaowen Bardzell  Indiana University Amanda Lazar  University of Maryland  College Park Norman Makoto Su  Indiana University,Informed by considerations from medicine and wellness research  experience design  investigations of new and emerging technologies  and sociopolitical critique  HCI researchers have demonstrated that women's health is a complex and rich topic. Turning these research outputs into productive interventions  however  is difficult. We argue that design is well positioned to address such a challenge thanks to its methodological traditions of problem setting and framing situated in synthetic (rather than analytic) knowledge production. In this paper  we focus on designing for experiences of menopause. Building on our prior empirical work on menopause and our commitment to pursue design informed by women's lived experience  we iteratively generated dozens of design frames and accompanying design crits. We document the unfolding of our design reasoning  showing how good-seeming insights nonetheless often lead to bad designs  while working progressively towards stronger insights and design constructs. The latter we offer as a contribution to researchers and practitioners who work at the intersections of women's health and design.
135,Parting the Red Sea: Sociotechnical Systems and Lived Experiences of Menopause,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Amanda Lazar  University of Maryland  College Park Norman Makoto Su  Indiana University Jeffrey Bardzell  Indiana University Shaowen Bardzell  Indiana University,Menopause is a major life change affecting roughly half of the population  resulting in physiological  emotional  and social changes. To understand experiences with menopause holistically  we conducted a study of a subreddit forum. The project was informed by feminist social science methodologies  which center knowledge production on women's lived experiences. Our central finding is that the lived experience of menopause is social: menopause is less about bodily experiences by themselves and more about how experiences with the body become meaningful over time in the social context. We find that gendered marginalization shapes diverse social relationships  leading to widespread feelings of alienation and negative transformation — often expressed in semantically dense figurative language. Research and design can accordingly address menopause not only as a women's health concern  but also as a matter of facilitating social support and a social justice issue.
136,Notjustgirls: Exploring Male-related Eating Disordered Content across Social Media Platforms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,Jessica A. Pater  Parkview Research Center & Georgia Institute of Technology Lauren E. Reining  Parkview Research Center Andrew D. Miller  Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Tammy Toscos  Parkview Research Center Elizabeth D. Mynatt  Georgia Institute of Technology,Eating disorders (EDs) are a worldwide public health concern that impact approximately 10% of the U.S. population. Our previous research characterized these behaviors across online spaces. These characterizations have used clinical terminology  and their lexical variants  to identify ED content online. However  previous HCI research on EDs (including our own) suffers from a lack of gender and cultural diversity. In this paper  we designed a follow-up study of online ED characterizations  extending our previous methodologies to focus specifically on male/masculine-related content. We highlight the similarities and differences found in the terminology utilized and media archetypes associated with the social media content. Finally  we discuss other considerations highlighted through our analysis of the male-related content that is missing from the previous research.
137,Psychologically Inclusive Design: Cues Impact Women's Participation in STEM Education,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Dochart 2,René F. Kizilcec  Cornell University Andrew J. Saltarelli  Stanford University,Visual and verbal cues can reinforce barriers to access for women in science  technology  engineering  and math (STEM) disciplines. Psychologically inclusive design is an evidence-based approach to reduce psychological barriers by strategically placing content and design cues in the environment. Two large field experiments provide estimates of the behavioral impact of psychologically inclusive cues on women's and men's enrollment behaviors in an online learning environment. First  a gender-inclusive photo and statement in an online advertisement for a STEM course increased the click-through rate among women but not men by 26% (N=209 000). Second  an inclusivity statement with a gender-inclusive course image to the enrollment page raised the proportion of women enrolling in a STEM course by up to 18% (N=63 000). These findings contribute evidence of the behavioral impact of psychologically inclusive design to the literature and yield practical implications for the presentation of STEM opportunities.

139,Crowdworker Economics in the Gig Economy,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Forth,Jason T. Jacques  University of Cambridge Per Ola Kristensson  University of Cambridge,The nature of work is changing. As labor increasingly trends to casual work in the emerging gig economy  understanding the broader economic context is crucial to effective engagement with a contingent workforce. Crowdsourcing represents an early manifestation of this fluid  laisser-faire  on-demand workforce. This work analyzes the results of four large-scale surveys of US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk workers recorded over a six-year period  providing comparable measures to national statistics. Our results show that despite unemployment far higher than national levels  crowdworkers are seeing positive shifts in employment status and household income. Our most recent surveys indicate a trend away from full-time-equivalent crowdwork  coupled with a reduction in estimated poverty levels to below national figures. These trends are indicative of an increasingly flexible workforce  able to maximize their opportunities in a rapidly changing national labor market  which may have material impacts on existing models of crowdworker behavior.
140,Crowdsourcing Multi-label Audio Annotation Tasks with Citizen Scientists,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Forth,Mark Cartwright  New York University Graham Dove  New York University Ana Elisa Méndez Méndez  New York University Juan Pablo Bello  New York University Oded Nov  New York University,Annotating rich audio data is an essential aspect of training and evaluating machine listening systems. We approach this task in the context of temporally-complex urban soundscapes  which require multiple labels to identify overlapping sound sources. Typically this work is crowdsourced  and previous studies have shown that workers can quickly label audio with binary annotation for single classes. However  this approach can be difficult to scale when multiple passes with different focus classes are required to annotate data with multiple labels. In citizen science  where tasks are often image-based  annotation efforts typically label multiple classes simultaneously in a single pass. This paper describes our data collection on the Zooniverse citizen science platform  comparing the efficiencies of different audio annotation strategies. We compared multiple-pass binary annotation  single-pass multi-label annotation  and a hybrid approach: hierarchical multi-pass multi-label annotation. We discuss our findings  which support using multi-label annotation  with reference to volunteer citizen scientists' motivations.
141,Navigating Ride-Sharing Regulations: How Regulations Changed the 'Gig' of Ride-Sharing for Drivers in Taiwan,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Forth,Anita Chen  Pennsylvania State University Chien Wen (Tina) Yuan  Fu Jen University Ning F. Ma  Pennsylvania State University Chi-Yang Hsu  Pennsylvania State University Benjamin V. Hanrahan  Pennsylvania State University,"Ride-sharing platforms have rapidly spread and disrupted ride hailing markets  resulting in conflicts between ride-sharing and taxi drivers. Taxi drivers claim that their counterparts have unfair advantages in terms of lower prices and a more stable customer base  making it difficult to earn a living. Local government entities have dealt with this disruption and conflict in different ways  often looking towards some form of regulation. While there have been discussions about what the regulation should be  there has been less work looking at what impacts regulations have on ride-sharing drivers and their usage of the platforms. In this paper we present our interview study of ride-sharing drivers in Taiwan  who have gone through three distinct phases of regulation. Drivers felt that regulations legitimized their work  while having to navigate consequences related to regulated access to platforms and fundamental changes to the ""gig'' of ride-sharing."
142,Why Do You Need This? Selective Disclosure of Data Among Citizen Scientists,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Forth,Anna Rudnicka  University College London Anna L. Cox  University College London Sandy J. J. Gould  University of Birmingham,Recent scandals involving data from participatory research have contributed to broader public concern about online privacy. Such concerns might make people more reluctant to participate in research that asks them to volunteer personal data  compromising many researchers' data collection. We tested several motivational messages that encouraged participation in a citizen science project. We measured people's willingness to disclose personal information. While participants were less likely to share sensitive data than neutral data  disclosure behaviour was not affected by attitudes to privacy. Importantly  we found that citizen scientists who were exposed to a motivational message that emphasised 'learning' were more likely to share sensitive information than those presented with other types of motivational cues. Our results suggest that priming individuals with motivational messages can increase their willingness to contribute personal data to a project  even if the request pertains to sensitive information.
143,Understanding Life Transitions: A Case Study of Support Needs of Low-Income Mothers,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Gala,Annu Sible Prabhakar  University of Cincinnati Erik Stolterman Bergqvist  Indiana University Bloomington Selma Šabanović  Indiana University,Life transitions are an integral part of the human experience. However  research shows that lack of support during life transitions can result in adverse health outcomes. To better understand the support needs and structures of low-income women during transition to motherhood  we interviewed 10 women and their 14 supporters during the transition. Our findings suggest that support needs and structures of mothers evolve during transition  and that they also vary by socio-economic contexts. In this paper  we detail our study design and findings. Informed by our findings  we posit that all life-transitions are not the same  and that therefore  the optimal support intervention point varies for different life transitions. Currently there are no tools available to identify optimal support intervention points during life transitions. To this end  we also introduce a preliminary framework - the Strength-Stress-Analysis (SSA) framework - to identify optimal support intervention points during life-transitions.
144,Accessing a New Land: Designing for a Social Conceptualisation of Access,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Gala,Lizzie Coles-Kemp  Royal Holloway University of London Rikke Bjerg Jensen  Royal Holloway University of London,"This paper presents a study of mobile phone use by people settling in a new land to access state provided digital services. It shows that digital literacy and access to technology are not the only resources and capabilities needed to successfully access digital services and do not guarantee a straightforward resettlement process. Using creative engagement methods  the research involved 132 ""newcomers"" seeking to settle in Sweden. Ribot and Peluso's theory of access (2003) was employed to examine the complex web of access experienced by our participants. We uncover that when communities are dealing with high levels of precarity  their primary concerns are related to accessing the benefits of a service  rather than controlling access. Broadening the HCI framework  the paper concludes that a sociotechnical model of access needs to connect access control and access benefit to facilitate the design of an effective digital service."
145,I Bought This for Me to Look More Ordinary: A Study of Blind People Doing Online Shopping,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Gala,Guanhong Liu  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Xianghua Ding  Fudan University Chun Yu  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education Lan Gao  Beihang University Xingyu Chi  Kensington Park School Yuanchun Shi  Tsinghua University & Ministry of Education,Online shopping  by reducing the needs for traveling  has become an essential part of lives for people with visual impairments. However  in HCI  research on online shopping for them has only been limited to the analysis of accessibility and usability issues. To develop a broader and better understanding of how visually impaired people shop online and design accordingly  we conducted a qualitative study with twenty blind people. Our study highlighted that blind people's desire of being treated as ordinary had significantly shaped their online shopping practices: very attentive to the visual appearance of the goods even they themselves could not see and taking great pain to find and learn what commodities are visually appropriate for them. This paper reports how their trying to appear ordinary is manifested in online shopping and suggests design implications to support these practices.
146,I was really  really nervous posting it: Communicating about Invisible Chronic Illnesses across Social Media Platforms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Gala,Shruti Sannon  Cornell University Elizabeth Murnane  Stanford University Natalya N. Bazarova  Cornell University Geri Gay  Cornell University,People with invisible chronic illnesses (ICIs) can use social media to seek both informational and emotional support  but these individuals also face social and health-related challenges in posting about their often-stigmatized conditions online. To understand how they evaluate different platforms for disclosure  we interviewed 19 people with ICIs who post on general social media about their illnesses  such as Facebook  Instagram  and Twitter. We present a cross-platform analysis of how platforms varied in their suitability to achieve participants' goals  as well as the challenges posed by each platform. We also found that as participants' ICIs progressed  their goals  challenges  and social media use similarly evolved over time. Our findings highlight how people with ICIs select platforms from a broader ecology of social media and suggest a general need to understand shifts in social media use for populations with chronic but changing health concerns.
147,Exploring How Privacy and Security Factor into IoT Device Purchase Behavior,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Pardis Emami-Naeini  Carnegie Mellon University Henry Dixon  Carnegie Mellon University Yuvraj Agarwal  Carnegie Mellon University Lorrie Faith Cranor  Carnegie Mellon University,Despite growing concerns about security and privacy of Internet of Things (IoT) devices  consumers generally do not have access to security and privacy information when purchasing these devices. We interviewed 24 participants about IoT devices they purchased. While most had not considered privacy and security prior to purchase  they reported becoming concerned later due to media reports  opinions shared by friends  or observing unexpected device behavior. Those who sought privacy and security information before purchase  reported that it was difficult or impossible to find. We asked interviewees to rank factors they would consider when purchasing IoT devices; after features and price  privacy and security were ranked among the most important. Finally  we showed interviewees our prototype privacy and security label. Almost all found it to be accessible and useful  encouraging them to incorporate privacy and security in their IoT purchase decisions.
148,Defending My Castle: A Co-Design Study of Privacy Mechanisms for Smart Homes,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Yaxing Yao  Syracuse University Justin Reed Basdeo  Syracuse University Smirity Kaushik  Syracuse University Yang Wang  Syracuse University,"Home is a person's castle  a private and protected space. Internet-connected devices such as locks  cameras  and speakers might make a home ""smarter"" but also raise privacy issues because these devices may constantly and inconspicuously collect  infer or even share information about people in the home. To explore user-centered privacy designs for smart homes  we conducted a co-design study in which we worked closely with diverse groups of participants in creating new designs. This study helps fill the gap in the literature between studying users' privacy concerns and designing privacy tools only by experts. Our participants' privacy designs often relied on simple strategies  such as data localization  disconnection from the Internet  and a private mode. From these designs  we identified six key design factors: data transparency and control  security  safety  usability and user experience  system intelligence  and system modality. We discuss how these factors can guide design for smart home privacy."

Thus  shoulder-surfing is a serious threat. To address this threat  we present the first investigation of shoulder-surfing resistant text password entry on gamepads by (1) identifying the requirements of this context; (2) assessing whether shoulder-surfing resistant authentication schemes proposed in non-gamepad contexts can be viably adapted to meet these requirements; (3) proposing ""Colorwheels""  a novel shoulder-surfing resistant authentication scheme specifically geared towards this context; (4) using two different methodologies proposed in the literature for evaluating shoulder-surfing resistance to compare ""Colorwheels""  on-screen keyboards (the de facto standard in this context)  and an existing shoulder-surfing resistant scheme which we identified during our assessment and adapted for the gamepad context; (5) evaluating all three schemes regarding their usability. Having applied different methodologies to measure shoulder-surfing resistance  we discuss their strengths and pitfalls and derive recommendations for future research."
150,Voice Presentation Attack Detection through Text-Converted Voice Command Analysis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 1,Il-Youp Kwak  Samsung Research Jun Ho Huh  Samsung Research Seung Taek Han  Samsung Research Iljoo Kim  Samsung Research Jiwon Yoon  Korea University,Voice assistants are quickly being upgraded to support advanced  security-critical commands such as unlocking devices  checking emails  and making payments. In this paper  we explore the feasibility of using users' text-converted voice command utterances as classification features to help identify users' genuine commands  and detect suspicious commands. To maintain high detection accuracy  our approach starts with a globally trained attack detection model (immediately available for new users)  and gradually switches to a user-specific model tailored to the utterance patterns of a target user. To evaluate accuracy  we used a real-world voice assistant dataset consisting of about 34.6 million voice commands collected from 2.6 million users. Our evaluation results show that this approach is capable of achieving about 3.4% equal error rate (EER)  detecting 95.7% of attacks when an optimal threshold value is used. As for those who frequently use security-critical (attack-like) commands  we still achieve EER below 5%.
151,Mapping the Margins: Navigating the Ecologies of Domestic Violence Service Provision,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Rosanna Bellini  Newcastle University Angelika Strohmayer  Newcastle University Patrick Olivier  Monash University Clara Crivellaro  Newcastle University,Work addressing the negative impacts of domestic violence on victim-survivors and service providers has slowly been contributing to the HCI discourse. However  work discussing the necessary  pre-emptive steps for researchers to enter these spaces sensitively and considerately  largely remains opaque. Heavily-politicised specialisms that are imbued with conflicting values and practices  such as domestic violence service delivery can be especially difficult to navigate. In this paper  we report on a mixed methods study consisting of interviews  a design dialogue and an ideation workshop with domestic violence service providers to explore the potential of an online service directory to support their work. Through this three-stage research process  we were able to characterise this unique service delivery landscape and identify tensions in services' access  understandings of technologies and working practices. Drawing from our findings  we discuss opportunities for researchers to work with and sustain complex information ecologies in sensitive settings.
152,Technologies for Social Justice: Lessons from Sex Workers on the Front Lines,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Angelika Strohmayer  Newcastle University Jenn Clamen  Stella  l'amie de Maimie Mary Laing  Northumbria University,This paper provides analysis and insight from a collaborative process with a Canadian sex worker rights organization called Stella  l'amie de Maimie  where we reflect on the use of and potential for digital technologies in service delivery. We analyze the Bad Client and Aggressor List – a reporting tool co-produced by sex workers in the community and Stella staff to reduce violence against sex workers. We analyze its current and potential future formats as an artefact for communication  in a context of sex work criminalization and the exclusion of sex workers from traditional routes for reporting violence and accessing governmental systems for justice. This paper addresses a novel aspect of HCI research that relates to digital technologies and social justice. Reflecting on the Bad Client and Aggressor List  we discuss how technologies can interact with justice-oriented service delivery and develop three implications for design.
153,Street-Level Algorithms: A Theory at the Gaps Between Policy and Decisions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Hall 2,Ali Alkhatib  Stanford University Michael S. Bernstein  Stanford University,Errors and biases are earning algorithms increasingly malignant reputations in society. A central challenge is that algorithms must bridge the gap between high-level policy and on-the-ground decisions  making inferences in novel situations where the policy or training data do not readily apply. In this paper  we draw on the theory of street-level bureaucracies  how human bureaucrats such as police and judges interpret policy to make on-the-ground decisions. We present by analogy a theory of street-level algorithms  the algorithms that bridge the gaps between policy and decisions about people in a socio-technical system. We argue that unlike street-level bureaucrats  who reflexively refine their decision criteria as they reason through a novel situation  street-level algorithms at best refine their criteria only after the decision is made. This loop-and-a-half delay results in illogical decisions when handling new or extenuating circumstances. This theory suggests designs for street-level algorithms that draw on historical design patterns for street-level bureaucracies  including mechanisms for self-policing and recourse in the case of error.

In the present work  we introduce a novel approach to address this problem: using psychologically ""embedded'' CAPTCHAs containing stimuli intended to prime positive emotions and mindsets. An exploratory randomized experiment (N = 454 Mechanical Turk workers) tested the impact of eight new CAPTCHA designs implemented on a simulated  politically charged comment thread. Results revealed that the two interventions that were the most successful at activating positive affect also significantly increased the positivity of tone and analytical complexity of argumentation in participants' responses. A focused follow-up experiment (N = 120 Mechanical Turk workers) revealed that exposure to CAPTCHAs featuring image sets previously validated to evoke low-arousal positive emotions significantly increased the positivity of sentiment and the levels of complexity and social connectedness in participants' posts. We offer several explanations for these results and discuss the practical and ethical implications of designing interfaces to influence discourse in online forums."

Lee  New Jersey Institute of Technology Viktoria Pammer-Schindler  Graz University of Technology Amy Ogan  Carnegie Mellon University Joseph Jay Williams  University of Toronto,In this SIG  we propose a gathering of researchers and practitioners thinking about HCI in learning and educational contexts to foster an ongoing Learning and Education community at CHI. With the recent increase in CHI submissions relating to learning (40% more submissions than previous CHI)  this SIG is an opportunity to foster an inclusive dialogue on designing and studying phenomena  tools  and processes related to learning and education. This SIG will bring together researchers  educators  and practitioners with three goals in mind: (1) discussing more inclusive cross-disciplinary perspectives on learning; (2) defining future directions and standards for learning and education contributions in CHI; and (3) building community across research/practice boundaries.
156,Ethical Mediation in UX Practice,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Lomond,Colin M. Gray  Purdue University Shruthi Sai Chivukula  Purdue University,HCI scholars have become increasingly interested in describing the complex nature of UX practice. In parallel  HCI and STS scholars have sought to describe the ethical and value-laden relationship between designers and design outcomes. However  little research describes the ethical engagement of UX practitioners as a form of design complexity  including the multiple mediating factors that impact ethical awareness and decision-making. In this paper  we use a practice-led approach to describe ethical complexity  presenting three varied cases of UX practitioners based onin situ observations and interviews. In each case  we describe salient factors relating to ethical mediation  including organizational practices  self-driven ethical principles  and unique characteristics of specific projects the practitioner is engaged in. Using the concept of mediation from activity theory  we provide a rich account of practitioners' ethical decision making. We propose future work on ethical awareness and design education based on the concept of ethical mediation.
157,An Exploration of Bitcoin Mining Practices: Miners' Trust Challenges and Motivations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Lomond,Irni Eliana Khairuddin  Universiti Teknologi MARA Corina Sas  Lancaster University,Bitcoin blockchain technology is a distributed ledger of nodes authorizing transactions between anonymous parties. Its key actors are miners using computational power to solve mathematical problems for validating transactions. By sharing blockchain's characteristics  mining is a decentralized  transparent and unregulated practice  less explored in HCI  so we know little about miners' motivations and experiences  and how these may impact on different dimensions of trust. This paper reports on interviews with 20 bitcoin miners about their practices and trust challenges. Findings contribute to HCI theories by extending the exploration of blockchain's characteristics relevant to trust with the competitiveness dimension underpinning the social organization of mining. We discuss the risks of collaborative mining due to centralization and dishonest administrators  and conclude with design implications highlighting the need for tools monitoring the distribution of rewards in collaborative mining  tools tracking data centers' authorization and reputation  and tools supporting the development of decentralized pools.
158,Analyzing Value Discovery in Design Decisions Through Ethicography,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Lomond,Shruthi Sai Chivukula  Purdue University Colin M. Gray  Purdue University Jason A. Brier  Purdue University,HCI scholarship is increasingly concerned with the ethical impact of socio-technical systems. Current theoretically driven approaches that engage with ethics generally prescribe only abstract approaches by which designers might consider values in the design process. However  there is little guidance on methods that promote value discovery  which might lead to more specific examples of relevant values in specific design contexts. In this paper  we elaborate a method for value discovery  identifying how values impact the designer's decision making. We demonstrate the use of this method  called Ethicography  in describing value discovery and use throughout the design process. We present analysis of design activity by user experience (UX) design students in two lab protocol conditions  describing specific human values that designers considered for each task  and visualizing the interplay of these values. We identify opportunities for further research  using the Ethicograph method to illustrate value discovery and translation into design solutions.
159,Autonomous Distributed Energy Systems: Problematising the Invisible through Design  Drama and Deliberation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 11:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 12:20,Lomond,Larissa Pschetz  University of Edinburgh Kruakae Pothong  University College London Chris Speed  University of Edinburgh,Technologies such as blockchains  smart contracts and programmable batteries facilitate emerging models of energy distribution  trade and consumption  and generate a considerable number of opportunities for energy markets. However  these developments complicate relationships between stakeholders  disrupting traditional notions of value  control and ownership. Discussing these issues with the public is particularly challenging as energy consumption habits often obscure the competing values and interests that shape stakeholders' relationships. To make such difficult discussions more approachable and examine the missing relational aspect of autonomous energy systems  we combined the design of speculative hairdryers with performance and deliberation. This integrated method of inquiry makes visible the competing values and interests  eliciting people's wishes to negotiate these terms. We argue that the complexity of mediated energy distribution and its convoluted stakeholder relationships requires more sophisticated methods of inquiry to engage people in debates concerning distributed energy systems.

The rapid pace of change leaves some tools and technologies behind. We must focus our attention primarily on current developments. Why look in the rear-view mirror? Some topics that are being actively explored now will soon be of less interest  so career planning benefits from thoughtfully identifying trajectories. To make use of relevant information in other fields you must understand how their terminologies  priorities  and methods evolved. We will cover the history of several HCI fields and discuss opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Software evolved from passively reacting to human input to today's dynamic partnership. In some areas HCI advanced steadily  elsewhere it reached dead ends or seemed to go in circles. Understanding these patterns will prepare you to respond to unexpected developments in years to come. The forces that shaped HCI in computer science  human factors  information systems  information science  and design are covered  with examples and implications for our new era.

Drucker  Microsoft Research Eytan Adar  University of Michigan,Despite the availability of software to support Affinity Diagramming (AD)  practitioners still largely favor physical sticky-notes. Physical notes are easy to set-up  can be moved around in space and offer flexibility when clustering un-structured data. However  when working with mixed data sources such as surveys  designers often trade off the physicality of notes for analytical power. We propose AffinityLens  a mobile-based augmented reality (AR) application for Data-Assisted Affinity Diagramming (DAAD). Our application provides just-in-time quantitative insights overlaid on physical notes. Affinity Lens uses several different types of AR overlays (called lenses) to help users find specific notes  cluster information  and summarize insights from clusters. Through a formative study of AD users  we developed design principles for data-assisted AD and an initial collection of lenses. Based on our prototype  we find that Affinity Lens supports easy switching between qualitative and quantitative 'views' of data  without surrendering the lightweight benefits of existing AD practice.

When documents are presented on digital devices  however  they can provide unique functionality to users  such as the ability to search  view dynamic multimedia content  and make use of indexing. This work explores the fusion of physical and digital paper documents. It first presents the results of a study that probed how users perform document-intensive analytical tasks when both physical and digital versions of documents were available. The study findings then informed the design of HoloDoc  a mixed reality system that augments physical artifacts with rich interaction and dynamic virtual content. Finally  we present the interaction techniques that HoloDoc affords  and the results of a second study that assessed HoloDoc's utility when working with digital and physical copies of academic articles.

Thomas  University of South Australia Mark Billinghurst  University of South Australia,We propose a multi-scale Mixed Reality (MR) collaboration between the Giant  a local Augmented Reality user  and the Miniature  a remote Virtual Reality user  in Giant-Miniature Collaboration (GMC). The Miniature is immersed in a 360-video shared by the Giant who can physically manipulate the Miniature through a tangible interface  a combined 360-camera with a 6 DOF tracker. We implemented a prototype system as a proof of concept and conducted a user study (n=24) comprising of four parts comparing: A) two types of virtual representations  B) three levels of Miniature control  C) three levels of 360-video view dependencies  and D) four 360-camera placement positions on the Giant. The results show users prefer a shoulder mounted camera view  while a view frustum with a complimentary avatar is a good visualization for the Miniature virtual representation. From the results  we give design recommendations and demonstrate an example Giant-Miniature Interaction.
166,DMove: Directional Motion-based Interaction for Augmented Reality Head-Mounted Displays,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 1,Wenge Xu  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Hai-Ning Liang  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Yuxuan Zhao  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Difeng Yu  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Diego Monteiro  Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,We present DMove  directional motion-based interaction for Augmented Reality (AR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) that is both hands- and device-free. It uses directional walk-ing as a way to interact with virtual objects. To use DMove  a user needs to perform directional motions such as mov-ing one foot forward or backward. In this research  we first investigate the recognition accuracy of the motion direc-tions of our method and the social acceptance of this type of interactions together with users' comfort rating for each direction. We then optimize its design and conduct a sec-ond study to compare DMove in task performance and user preferences (workload  motion sickness  user experience)  with two approaches—Hand interaction (Meta 2-like) and Head+Hand interaction (HoloLens-like) for menu selection tasks. Based on the results of these two studies  we provide a set of guidelines for DMove and further demonstrate two applications that utilize directional motions.
167,Spaces and Traces: Implications of Smart Technology in Public Housing,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Sandjar Kozubaev  Georgia Institute of Technology Fernando Rochaix  Georgia Statue University Carl DiSalvo  Georgia Institute of Technology Christopher A. Le Dantec  Georgia Institute of Technology,Smart home technologies are beginning to become more widespread and common  even as their deployment and implementation remain complex and spread across different competing commercial ecosystems. Looking beyond the middle-class  single-family home often at the center of the smart home narrative  we report on a series of participatory design workshops held with residents and building managers to better understand the role of smart home technologies in the context of public housing in the U.S. The design workshops enabled us to gather insight into the specific challenges and opportunities of deploying smart home technologies in a setting where issues of privacy  data collection and ownership  and autonomy collide with diverse living arrangements  where income  age  and the consequences of monitoring and data aggregation setup an expanding collection of design implications in the ecosystems of smart home technologies.
168,My Naturewatch Camera: Disseminating Practice Research with a Cheap and Easy DIY Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,William Gaver  Goldsmiths  University of London Andy Boucher  Goldsmiths  University of London Michail Vanis  Goldsmiths  University of London Andy Sheen  Goldsmiths  University of London Dean Brown  Goldsmiths  University of London Liliana Ovalle  Goldsmiths  University of London Naho Matsuda  Goldsmiths  University of London Amina Abbas-Nazari  Royal College of Art Robert Phillips  Royal College of Art,My Naturewatch Camera is an inexpensive wildlife camera that we designed for people to make themselves as a way of promoting engagement with nature and digital making. We aligned its development to the interests of the BBC's Natural History Unit as part of an orchestrated engagement strategy also involving our project website and outreach to social media. Since June 2018  when the BBC featured the camera on one of their Springwatch 2018 broadcasts  over 1000 My Naturewatch Cameras have been constructed using instructions and software from our project website and commercially available components  without direct contact with our studio. In this paper  we describe the project and outcomes with a focus on its success in promoting engagement with nature  engagement with digital making  and the effectiveness of this strategy for sharing research products outside traditional commercial channels.
169,Life-Affirming Biosensing in Public: Sounding Heartbeats on a Red Bench,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Noura Howell  University of California  Berkeley Greg Niemeyer  University of California  Berkeley Kimiko Ryokai  University of California  Berkeley,"Smart city narratives promise IoT data-driven innovations leveraging biosensing technologies. We argue this overlooks a potential benefit of city living: affirmation. We designed the Heart Sounds Bench  which amplifies the heart sounds of those sitting on it  as well as recording and playing back the heart sounds of previous sitters. We outline our design intent to invite rest  reflection  and recognition of others' lives in public space. We share results from a study with 19 participants. Participants expressed feeling connected to a shared life energy including others and the environment  and described heart sounds as feeling intimate yet anonymous. Finally  we elaborate the concept of life-affirmation in terms of recognition of others' lives  feeling connection  and respecting untranslatable differences with opacity  as a way of helping ""smart city"" designs embrace a multiplicity of desires."
170,City Explorer: The Design and Evaluation of a Location-Based Community Information System,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Alsh 2,Carolyn Pang  Simon Fraser University Rui Pan  Simon Fraser University Carman Neustaedter  Simon Fraser University Kate Hennessy  Simon Fraser University,Many working professionals commute via public transit  yet they have limited tools for learning about their urban neighborhoods and fellow commuters. We designed a location-based game called City Explorer to investigate how transit commuters capture  share  and view community information that is specifically tied to locations. Through a four-week field study  we found that participants valued the increased awareness of their personal travel routines that they gained through City Explorer. When viewing community information  they preferred information that was factual rather than opinion-based and was presented at the start and end of their commutes. Participants found less value in connecting with other transit riders because transit rides were often seen as opportunities to disengage from others. We discuss how location-based technologies can be designed to display factual community information before  during  and at the end of transit commutes.
171,Participatory Design of a Virtual Reality-Based Reentry Training with a Women's Prison,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Melissa Qingqing Teng  Emerson College James Hodge  Newcastle University Eric Gordon  Emerson College,This study examines the participatory design process of a virtual reality (VR) reentry training program with a women's prison. Conceptually drawing on previous work in VR exposure training  this prototype consists of guided  first-person 3D-360° video episodes that depict psychologically stressful situations that women commonly face when returning home. Critical story and production elements  including screenplay  acting  and narration  were created with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women. The institutional  technological  and cultural restrictions of prison  combined with the tensions of making media with often exploited groups  forced adaptations of participatory design methods. The inclusion of incarcerated female voices resulted in an immersive narrative that reflects this group's specific challenges. The next phase is to evaluate its efficacy against non-immersive comparative trainings for reentry-related anxieties.
172,A Change of Perspective: Designing the Automated Vehicle as a New Social Actor in a Public Space,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Lenja Sorokin  BMW Group Ronee Chadowitz  BMW Group Nina Kauffmann  BMW Group,With the rise of automated vehicles  a new road user had to be designed  an autonomous system that needs to integrate into an ecosystem of human-human interaction. Traditionally automotive UX is focused on the interaction between the driver and the vehicle. This new design challenge however comprised a change of perspective from driver/inside to road user/outside and from a system that is steered by a human being to an intelligent system that proactively makes decisions in a public space. A new approach was necessary to handle this change of perspective in the design process and to instill it into the heads of the stakeholders. We modified a user centered process to satisfy the challenge of designing the automated vehicle as a social actor. For example  we designed for acceptance by defining a character based on hopes and concerns of the public. The flow of communication was analyzed and intent based visual and acoustic signals were designed and evaluated in a purpose-built simulator. The lessons we learned from this process might also be applicable to the design of other autonomous  public facing systems.
173,Understanding Abusive Behaviour Between Online and Offline Group Discussions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Abdulwhab Alkharashi  University of Glasgow Tim Storer  University of Glasgow Joemon Jose  University of Glasgow Andrew Hoskins  University of Glasgow Catherine Happer  University of Glasgow,Online discussion platforms can face multiple challenges of abusive behaviour. In order to understand the reasons for persisting such behaviour  we need to understand how users behave inside and outside a community. In this paper  we propose a novel methodology to generate a dataset from offline and online group discussion conversations. We advocate an empirical-based approach to explore the space of abusive behaviour. We conducted a user-study (N = 15) to understand what factors facilitate or amplify forms of behaviour in cases of online conversation that are less likely to be tolerated in face-to-face. The preliminary analysis validates our approach to analyse large-scale conversation dataset.
174,Lab Hackathons to Overcome Laboratory Equipment Shortages in Africa: Opportunities and Challenges,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Argyll 1 CROWNE,Helena Webb  University of Oxford Jason R.C. Nurse  University of Kent Louise Bezuidenhout  University of Oxford Marina Jirotka  University of Oxford,Equipment shortages in Africa undermine Science  Technology  Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education. We have pioneered the LabHackathon (LabHack): a novel initiative that adapts the conventional hackathon and draws on insights from the Open Hardware movement and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). LabHacks are fun  educational events that challenge student participants to build frugal and reproducible pieces of laboratory equipment. Completed designs are then made available to others. LabHacks can therefore facilitate the open and sustainable design of laboratory equipment  in situ  in Africa. In this case study we describe the LabHackathon model  discuss its application in a pilot event held in Zimbabwe and outline the opportunities and challenges it presents.

177,Beautiful Seams: Strategic Revelations and Concealments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Sarah Inman  University of Washington David Ribes  University of Washington,This paper tracks a debate that occurred  first  within the field of Ubiquitous Computing but quickly spread to CHI and beyond  in which design scholars argued that seamlessness had long been an implicit and privileged design virtue  often at the expense of seamfulness. Seamless design emphasizes clarity  simplicity  ease of use  and consistency to facilitate technological interaction. Seamful design emphasizes configurability  user appropriation  and revelation of complexity  ambiguity or inconsistency. Here we review these literatures together and argue that  rather than rival approaches  seamful and seamless design are complements  each emphasizing different aspects of downstream user agency. Ultimately  we situate this debate within the larger  perennial discussion about the strategic revelation and concealment of human and technological operations  and therein the role of design.
178,Designing for the Infrastructure of the Supply Chain of Malay Handwoven Songket in Terengganu,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Min Zhang  Lancaster University Corina Sas  Lancaster University Zoe Lambert  Lancaster University Masitah Ahmad  Universiti Teknologi MARA,The growing HCI interest in developing contexts and cultural craft practices is ripe to focus on their under-explored homegrown sociotechnical infrastructures. This paper explores the creative infrastructural actions embedded within the practices of songket's supply chain in Terengganu  Malaysia. We report on contextual interviews with 92 participants including preparation workers  weavers  designers  merchants  and customers. Findings indicate that increased creative infrastructural actions are reflected in these actors' resourcefulness for mobilizing information  materials  and equipment  and for making creative artifacts through new technologies weaved within traditional practices. We propose two novel approaches to design in this craft-based infrastructure. First  we explore designing for the social layer of infrastructure and its mutually advantageous exploitative relationships rooted in culture and traditions. Second  we suggest designing for roaming value-creation artifacts  which blend physical and digital materializations of songket textile design. Developed through a collaborative and asynchronous process  we argue that these artifacts represent less-explored vehicles for value co-creation  and that sociotechnical infrastructures as emerging sites of innovation could benefit from HCI research.
179,Multi-plié: A Linear Foldable and Flattenable Interactive Display to Support Efficiency  Safety and Collaboration,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Sylvain Pauchet  University of Toulouse - ENAC & Astrolab Jean-Luc Vinot  University of Toulouse - ENAC Catherine Letondal  University of Toulouse - ENAC Alexandre Lemort  Ingenuity i/o Claire Lavenir  Intactile Design Timothée Lecomte  University of Toulouse - ENAC Stéphanie Rey  Berger-Levrault Valentin Becquet  University of Toulouse - ENAC Guillaume Crouzet  University of Toulouse - ENAC,We present the design concept of an accordion-fold interactive display to address the limits of touch-based interaction in airliner cockpits. Based on an analysis of pilot activity  tangible design principles for this design concept are identified. Two resulting functional prototypes are explored during participatory workshops with pilots  using activity scenarios. This exploration validated the design concept by revealing its ability to match pilot responsibilities in terms of safety  efficiency and collaboration. It provides an efficient visual perception of the system for real-time collaborative operations and tangible interaction to strengthen the perception of action and to manage safety through anticipation and awareness. The design work and insights enabled to specify further our needs regarding flexible screens. They also helped to better characterize the design concept as based on continuity of a developed surface  predictability of aligned folds and pleat face roles  embodied interactive properties  and flexibility through affordable reconfigurations.
180,FiberWire: Embedding Electronic Function into 3D Printed Mechanically Strong  Lightweight Carbon Fiber Composite Objects,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 1,Saiganesh Swaminathan  Carnegie Mellon University Kadri Bugra Ozutemiz  Carnegie Mellon University Carmel Majidi  Carnegie Mellon University Scott Hudson  Carnegie Mellon University,3D printing offers significant potential in creating highly customized interactive and functional objects. However  at present ability to manufacture functional objects is limited by available materials (e.g.  various polymers) and their process properties. For instance  many functional objects need stronger materials which may be satisfied with metal printers. However  to create wholly interactive devices  we need both conductors and insulators to create wiring  and electronic components to complete circuits. Unfortunately  the single material nature of metal printing  and its inherent high temperatures  preclude this. Thus  in 3D printed devices  we have had a choice of strong materials  or embedded interactivity  but not both. In this paper  we introduce a set of techniques we call FiberWire  which leverages a new commercially available capability to 3D print carbon fiber composite objects. These objects are light weight and mechanically strong  and our techniques demonstrate a means to embed circuitry for interactive devices within them. With FiberWire  we describe a fabrication pipeline takes advantage of laser etching and fiber printing between layers of carbon-fiber composite to form low resistance conductors  thereby enabling the fabrication of electronics directly embedded into mechanically strong objects. Utilizing the fabrication pipeline  we show a range of sensor designs  their performance characterization on these new materials and finally three fully printed example object that are both interactive and mechanically strong -- a bicycle handle bar with interactive controls  a swing and impact sensing golf club and an interactive game controller (Figure 1).
181,Sensory Alignment in Immersive Entertainment,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Joe Marshall  University of Nottingham Steve Benford  University of Nottingham Richard Byrne  RMIT University Paul Tennent  University of Nottingham,When we use digital systems to stimulate the senses  we typically stimulate only a subset of users' senses  leaving other senses stimulated by the physical world. This creates potential for misalignment between senses  where digital and physical stimulation give conflicting signals to users. We synthesize knowledge from HCI  traditional entertainments  and underlying sensory science research relating to how senses work when given conflicting signals. Using this knowledge we present a design dimension of sensory alignment  and show how this dimension presents opportunities for a range of creative strategies ranging from full alignment of sensory stimulation  up to extreme conflict between senses.
182,A Framework for the Experience of Meaning in Human-Computer Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Elisa D. Mekler  University of Basel Kasper Hornbæk  University of Copenhagen,The view of quality in human-computer interaction continuously develops  having in past decades included consistency  transparency  usability  and positive emotions. Recently  meaning is receiving increased interest in the user experience literature and in industry  referring to the end  purpose or significance of interaction with computers. However  the notion of meaning remains elusive and a bewildering number of senses are in use. We present a framework of meaning in interaction  based on a synthesis of psychological meaning research. The framework outlines five distinct senses of the experience of meaning: connectedness  purpose  coherence  resonance  and significance. We illustrate the usefulness of the framework by analyzing a selection of recent papers at the CHI conference and by raising a series of open research questions about the interplay of meaning  user experience  reflection  and well-being.
183,Understanding the Impact of Information Representation on Willingness to Share Information,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Stefan Schneegass  University of Duisburg-Essen Romina Poguntke  University of Stuttgart Tonja Machulla  LMU Munich,Since the release of the first activity tracker  there has been a steady increase in the number of sensors embedded in wearable devices and with it in the amount and diversity of information that can be derived from these sensors. This development leads to novel privacy threats for users. In a web survey with 248 participants  we explored whether users' willingness to share private data is dependent on how the data is requested by an application. Specifically  requests can be formulated as access to sensor data or as access to information derived from the sensor data (e.g.  accelerometer vs. sleep quality). We show that non-expert users lack an understanding of how the two representation levels relate to each other. The results suggest that the willingness to share sensor data over derived information is governed by whether the derived information has positive or negative connotations (e.g.  training intensity vs. life expectancy). Using the results of the survey  we derive implications for supporting users in protecting their private data collected via wearable sensors.
184,Making Sense of Human-Food Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Boisdale 2,Ferran Altarriba Bertran  University of California  Santa Cruz Samvid Jhaveri  University of California  Santa Cruz Rosa Lutz  University of California  Santa Cruz Katherine Isbister  University of California  Santa Cruz Danielle Wilde  University of Southern Denmark,Activity in Human-Food Interaction (HFI) research is skyrocketing across a broad range of disciplinary interests and concerns. The dynamic and heterogeneous nature of this emerging field presents a challenge to scholars wishing to critically engage with prior work  identify gaps and ensure impact. It also challenges the formation of community. We present a Systematic Mapping Study of HFI research and an online data visualisation tool developed to respond to these issues. The tool allows researchers to engage in new ways with the HFI literature  propose modifications and additions to the review  and thereby actively engage in community-making. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we characterize the state of HFI  reporting trends  challenges and opportunities; (2) we provide a taxonomy and tool for diffractive reading of the literature; and (3) we offer our approach for adaptation by research fields facing similar challenges  positing value of the tool and approach beyond HFI.
185,Communication Cost of Single-user Gesturing Tool in Laparoscopic Surgical Training,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Yuanyuan Feng  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Katie Li  Pomona College Azin Semsar  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Hannah McGowan  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Jacqueline Mun  Vassar College H. Reza Zahiri  Anne Arundel Medical Center Ivan George  Johns Hopkins University Adrian Park  Anne Arundel Medical Center Andrea Kleinsmith  University of Maryland  Baltimore County Helena M. Mentis  University of Maryland  Baltimore County,Multi-user input over a shared display has been shown to support group process and improve performance. However  current gesturing systems for instructional collaborative tasks limit the input to experts and overlook the needs of novices in making references on a shared display. In this paper  we investigate the effects of a single-user gesturing tool on the communication between trainer and trainees in a laparoscopic surgical training. By comparing the communication structure and content between the trainings with and without the gesturing tool  we show that the communication becomes more imbalanced and the trainees become less active when using the single-user gesturing tool. Our findings highlight the needs to grant all parties the same level of access to a shared display and suggest further directions in designing a shared display for instructional collaborative tasks.
186,An Autonomy-Perspective on the Design of Assistive Technology Experiences of People with Multiple Sclerosis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Florian Güldenpfennig  New Design University and Technische Universität Wien Peter Mayer  Technische Universität Wien Paul Panek  Technische Universität Wien Geraldine Fitzpatrick  Technische Universität Wien,In HCI and Assistive Technology design  autonomy is regularly equated with independence. This is a shortcut and leaves out design opportunities by omitting a more nuanced idea of autonomy. To improve our understanding of how people with severe physical disabilities experience autonomy  particularly in the context of Assistive Technologies  we engaged in in-depth fieldwork with 15 people with Multiple Sclerosis who were used to assistive devices. We constructed a grounded theory from a series of interviews  focus groups and observations  pointing to strategies in which participants sought autonomy either in the short-term (managing their daily energy reserve) or in the long-term (making future plans). The theory shows how factors like enabling technologies  capital (human  social  psychological resources)  and compatibility with daily practices facilitated a sense of being in control for our participants. Moreover  we show how over-ambitious or bad design (e.g.  paternalism) can lead to opposite results and restrict autonomy.
187,Exploring the Opportunities for Technologies to Enhance Quality of Life with People who have Experienced Vision Loss,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Rachel Bartlett  University of Iowa Yi Xuan Khoo  University of Iowa Juan Pablo Hourcade  University of Iowa Kyle K. Rector  University of Iowa,Research predicts that 196 million people will be diagnosed with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) by 2020. People who experience AMD and other vision loss face barriers that affect their Quality of Life (QoL). People experience only modest improvement from technologies (e.g.  screen readers  CCTV)  tools (e.g.  magnifying glasses  tactile buttons)  and human help (e.g.  friends  blindness organizations). Further  there are issues to accessing these resources based on one's place of residence. To explore these challenges and determine design implications to support people who have experienced vision loss (PVL)  we conducted a qualitative semi-structured interview study exploring QoL with 10 PVL. We uncovered themes of supporting creative work  recognizing the impact of one's living in a non-urban setting on QoL  and increasing efficiency at accomplishing tasks. We motivate the inclusion of PVL in the design process because they learned skills while sighted and are now low vision or blind.
188,Seekers  Providers  Welcomers  and Storytellers: Modeling Social Roles in Online Health Communities,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 1,Diyi Yang  Carnegie Mellon University Robert E. Kraut  Carnegie Mellon University Tenbroeck Smith  American Cancer Society  Inc. Elijah Mayfield  Carnegie Mellon University Dan Jurafsky  Stanford University,Participants in online communities often enact different roles when participating in their communities. For example  some in cancer support communities specialize in providing disease-related information or socializing new members. This work clusters the behavioral patterns of users of a cancer support community into specific functional roles. Based on a series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations  this research identified eleven roles that members occupy  such as welcomer and story sharer. We investigated role dynamics  including how roles change over members' lifecycles  and how roles predict long-term participation in the community. We found that members frequently change roles over their history  from ones that seek resources to ones offering help  while the distribution of roles is stable over the community's history. Adopting certain roles early on predicts members' continued participation in the community. Our methodology will be useful for facilitating better use of members' skills and interests in support of community-building efforts.
189,Augmenting Couples' Communication with Lifelines: Shared Timelines of Mixed Contextual Information,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Carla F. Griggio  University Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria & Université Paris-Saclay Midas Nouwens  Aarhus University & University Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay Joanna McGrenere  University of British Columbia & University Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay Wendy E. Mackay  Inria & Université Paris-Saclay,Couples exhibit special communication practices  but apps rarely offer couple-specific functionality. Research shows that sharing streams of contextual information (e.g. location  motion) helps couples coordinate and feel more connected. Most studies explored a single  ephemeral stream; we study how couples' communication changes when sharing multiple  persistent streams. We designed Lifelines  a mobile-app technology probe that visualizes up to six streams on a shared timeline: closeness to home  battery level  steps  media playing  texts and calls. A month-long study with nine couples showed that partners interpreted information mostly from individual streams  but also combined them for more nuanced interpretations. Persistent streams allowed missing data to become meaningful and provided new ways of understanding each other. Unexpected patterns from any stream can trigger calls and texts  whereas seeing expected data can replace direct communication  which may improve or disrupt established communication practices. We conclude with design implications for mediating awareness within couples.
190,Understanding Digitally-Mediated Empathy: An Exploration of Visual  Narrative  and Biosensory Informational Cues,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Max T. Curran  University of California  Berkeley Jeremy Raboff Gordon  University of California  Berkeley Lily Lin  University of California  Berkeley Priyashri Kamlesh Sridhar  Singapore University of Technology and Design John Chuang  University of California  Berkeley,"Digitally sharing our experiences engages a process of empathy shaped by available informational cues. Biosensory data is one informative cue  but the relationship to empathy is underexplored. In this study  we investigate this process by showing a video of a ""target'' person's visual perspective watching a virtual reality film to sixty ""observers''. We vary information available to observers via three experimental conditions: a baseline unmodified video  video with narrative text  or with a graph of electrodermal activity (EDA) of the target. Compared to baseline  narrative text increased empathic accuracy (EA) while EDA had an opposite  negative effect. Qualitatively  observers describe their empathic processes as using their own feelings supplemented with the information presented depending on the interpretability of that information. Both narration and EDA prompted observers to reconsider assumptions about another's experience. Our findings lead to a discussion of digitally-mediated empathy with implications for associated research and product development."
191,Reveal: Investigating Proactive Location-Based Reminiscing with Personal Digital Photo Repositories,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 2,David McGookin  Aalto University,Recording experiences and memories is an important role for digital photography  with smartphone cameras leading to individuals taking increasing numbers of pictures of everyday experiences. Increasingly  these are automatically stored in personal  cloud-backed  photo repositories. However  such experiences can be forgotten quickly  with images 'lost' within the user's library  loosing their role in supporting reminiscing. We investigate how users might be provoked to view these images and the benefits they bring through the development and evaluation of a proactive  location-based reminiscing tool  called Reveal. We outline how a location-based approach allowed participants to reflect more widely on their photo practice  and the potential of such reminiscing tools to support effective management and curation of individual's increasingly large personal photo collections.
192,Emotional Utility and Recall of the Facebook News Feed,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Carron 2,Pawarat Nontasil  University of Bath Stephen J. Payne  University of Bath,We report a laboratory study (N=53) in which participants browsed their own Facebook news feeds for 10-15 minutes  choosing exactly when to quit  and later rated the overall emotional utility of the episode before attempting to recall threads. Finally  the emotional utility of each encountered thread was rated while looking over a recording of the interaction. We report that Facebook browsing was  overall  an emotionally positive experience; that recall of threads exhibited classic primacy and recency serial order effects; that recalled threads were both more positive and more valenced (less neutral) on average  than forgotten threads; and that overall emotional valence judgments were predicted  statistically  by the peak and end thread judgments. We find no evidence that local quit decisions were driven by the emotional utility of threads. In the light of these findings  we discuss the suggestion that emotional utility might partly explain the attractiveness of reading the news feed  and that an emotional memory bias might further increase the attractiveness of the newsfeed in prospect.
193,Sketching in HCI: Hands-on Course of Sketching Techniques,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,Makayla Lewis  Brunel University London Miriam Sturdee  University of Calgary Nicolai Marquardt  University College London,Freehand sketching is a valuable process  input  output  and tool  often used by people to communicate and express ideas  as well as document  explore and describe concepts between researcher  user  or client. Sketches are fast  easy to create  and – by varying their fidelity – can be used in all areas of HCI. Sketching in HCI will explore and demonstrate themes around sketching in HCI with the aim of producing tangible outputs. Attendees will leave the course with the confidence to engage actively with sketching on an everyday basis in their research practice.
194,How to Write CHI Papers (Third Edition),Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Lennart E. Nacke  University of Waterloo,We base everything that we do as researchers on what we write. Primarily for graduate students and young researchers  it is hard to turn a research project into a successful CHI publication. This struggle continues for postdocs and young professors trying to author excellent reviews for the CHI community that pinpoint flaws and improvements in research papers. This third edition of the successful CHI paper writing course offers hands-on advice and more in-depth tutorials on how to write papers with clarity  substance  and style. It is structured into three 80-minute units with a focus on writing CHI papers.
195,Professional Presentation Training: Improve the User Experience of your CHI Presentation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Castle 3 CROWNE,Ash Brown  Bloomberg L.P.

196,Preemptive Action: Accelerating Human Reaction using Electrical Muscle Stimulation Without Compromising Agency,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Shunichi Kasahara  Sony CSL & University of Tokyo Jun Nishida  University of Chicago Pedro Lopes  University of Chicago,We enable preemptive force-feedback systems to speed up human reaction time without fully compromising the user's sense of agency. Typically these interfaces actuate by means of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) or mechanical actuators; they preemptively move the user to perform a task  such as to improve movement performance (e.g.  EMS-assisted drumming). Unfortunately  when using preemptive force-feedback users do not feel in control and loose their sense of agency. We address this by actuating the user's body  using EMS  within a particular time window (160 ms after visual stimulus)  which we found to speed up reaction time by 80 ms in our first study. With this preemptive timing  when the user and system move congruently  the user feels that they initiated the motion  yet their reaction time is faster than usual. As our second study demonstrated  this particular timing significantly increased agency when compared to the current practice in EMS-based devices. We conclude by illustrating  using examples from the HCI literature  how to leverage our findings to provide more agency to automated haptic interfaces.
197,ChewIt. An Intraoral Interface for Discreet Interactions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Pablo Gallego Cascón  The University of Auckland Denys J.C. Matthies  Auckland Bioengineering Institute Sachith Muthukumarana  The University of Auckland Suranga Nanayakkara  Auckland Bioengineering Institute  The University of Auckland,Sensing interfaces relying on head or facial gestures provide effective solutions for hands-free scenarios. Most of these interfaces utilize sensors attached to the face  as well as into the mouth  being either obtrusive or limited in input bandwidth. In this paper  we propose ChewIt -- a novel intraoral input interface. ChewIt resembles an edible object that allows users to perform various hands-free input operations  both simply and discreetly. Our design is informed by a series of studies investigating the implications of shape  size  locations for comfort  discreetness  maneuverability  and obstructiveness. Additionally  we evaluated potential gestures that users could use to interact with such an intraoral interface.
198,Clench Interface: Novel Biting Input Techniques,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Xuhai Xu  University of Washington & Tsinghua University Chun Yu  Tsinghua University Anind K. Dey  University of Washington Jennifer Mankoff  University of Washington,People eat every day and biting is one of the most fundamental and natural actions that they perform on a daily basis. Existing work has explored tooth click location and jaw movement as input techniques  however clenching has the potential to add control to this input channel. We propose clench interaction that leverages clenching as an actively controlled physiological signal that can facilitate interactions. We conducted a user study to investigate users' ability to control their clench force. We found that users can easily discriminate three force levels  and that they can quickly confirm actions by unclenching (quick release). We developed a design space for clench interaction based on the results and investigated the usability of the clench interface. Participants preferred the clench over baselines and indicated a willingness to use clench-based interactions. This novel technique can provide an additional input method in cases where users' eyes or hands are busy  augment immersive experiences such as virtual/augmented reality  and assist individuals with disabilities.
199,Interferi: Gesture Sensing using On-Body Acoustic Interferometry,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Clyde Auditorium,Yasha Iravantchi  Carnegie Mellon University Yang Zhang  Carnegie Mellon University Evi Bernitsas  Carnegie Mellon University Mayank Goel  Carnegie Mellon University Chris Harrison  Carnegie Mellon University,Interferi is an on-body gesture sensing technique using acoustic interferometry. We use ultrasonic transducers resting on the skin to create acoustic interference patterns inside the wearer's body  which interact with anatomical features in complex  yet characteristic ways. We focus on two areas of the body with great expressive power: the hands and face. For each  we built and tested a series of worn sensor configurations  which we used to identify useful transducer arrangements and machine learning fea-tures. We created final prototypes for the hand and face  which our study results show can support eleven- and nine-class gestures sets at 93.4% and 89.0% accuracy  re-spectively. We also evaluated our system in four continu-ous tracking tasks  including smile intensity and weight estimation  which never exceed 9.5% error. We believe these results show great promise and illuminate an inter-esting sensing technique for HCI applications.
200,Printer Pals: Experience-Centered Design to Support Agency for People with Dementia,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Sarah Foley  University College Cork Daniel Welsh  Newcastle University Nadia Pantidi  University College Cork Kellie Morrissey  Newcastle University Thomas Nappey  Newcastle University John McCarthy  University College Cork,Whereas there have been significant improvements in the quality of care provided for people with dementia  limited attention to the importance for people with dementia being enabled to make positive social contributions within care home contexts can restrict their sense of agency. In this paper we describe the design and deployment of 'Printer Pals' a receipt-based print media device  which encourages social contribution and agency within a care home environment. The design followed a two-year ethnography  from which the need for highlighting participation and supporting agency for residents within the care home became clear. The residents use of Printer Pals mediated participation in a number of different ways  such as engaging with the technology itself  offering shared experiences and participating in co-constructive and meaningful ways  each of which is discussed. We conclude with a series of design consideration to support agentic and caring interactions through inclusive design practices.
201,Towards Enabling Blind People to Independently Write on Printed Forms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Shirin Feiz  Stony Brook University Syed Masum Billah  Stony Brook University Vikas Ashok  Stony Brook University Roy Shilkrot  Stony Brook University IV Ramakrishnan  Stony Brook University,Filling out printed forms (e.g.  checks) independently is currently impossible for blind people  since they cannot pinpoint the locations of the form fields  and quite often  they cannot even figure out what fields (e.g.  name) are present in the form. Hence  they always depend on sighted people to write on their behalf  and help them affix their signatures. Extant assistive technologies have exclusively focused on reading  with no support for writing. In this paper  we introduce WiYG  a Write-it-Yourself guide that directs a blind user to the different form fields  so that she can independently fill out these fields without seeking assistance from a sighted person. Specifically  WiYG uses a pocket-sized custom 3D printed smartphone attachment  and well-established computer vision algorithms to dynamically generate audio instructions that guide the user to the different form fields. A user study with 13 blind participants showed that with WiYG  users could correctly fill out the form fields at the right locations with an accuracy as high as 89.5%.
202,ALAP: Accessible LaTeX Based Mathematical Document Authoring and Presentation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Ahtsham Manzoor  Lahore University of Management Sciences Safa Arooj  Lahore University of Management Sciences Shaban Zulfiqar  Lahore University of Management Sciences Murayyiam Parvez  Lahore University of Management Sciences Suleman Shahid  Lahore University of Management Sciences Asim Karim  Lahore University of Management Sciences,Assistive technologies such as screen readers and text editors have been used in past to improve the accessibility and authoring of scientific and mathematical documents. However  most screens readers fail to narrate complex mathematical notations and expressions as they skip symbols and necessary information required for the accurate narration of mathematical content. This study aims at evaluating a new Accessible LaTeX Based Mathematical Document Authoring and Presentation (ALAP) tool  which assist people with visual impairments in reading and writing mathematical documents. ALAP includes features like  assistive debugging  Math Mode for reading and writing mathematical notations  and automatic generation of an accessible PDF document. These features aim to improve the LaTeX debugging experience and make it simple for blind users to author mathematical content by narrating it in natural language through the use of integrated text to speech (TTS) engine. We evaluated ALAP by conducting a study with 18 visually impaired LaTeX users. The results showed that users preferred ALAP over another comparable LaTeX based authoring tool and were relatively more comfortable in completing the tasks while using ALAP.
203,Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 1,Shaomei Wu  Facebook Lindsay Reynolds  Facebook Xian Li  Facebook Francisco Guzmán  Facebook,People with dyslexia face challenges expressing themselves in writing on social networking sites (SNSs). Such challenges come from not only the technicality of writing  but also the self-representation aspect of sharing and communicating publicly on social networking sites such as Facebook. To empower people with dyslexia-style writing to express them-selves more confidently on SNSs  we designed and implemented Additional Writing Help(AWH) - a writing assistance tool to proofread text produced by users with dyslexia before they post on Facebook. AWH was powered by a neural machine translation (NMT) model that translates dyslexia style to non-dyslexia style writing. We evaluated the performance and the design of AWH through a week-long field study with 19 people with dyslexia and received highly positive feedback. Our field study demonstrated the value of providing better and more extensive writing support on SNSs  and the potential of AI for building a more inclusive Internet.
204,Signal Appropriation of Explicit HIV Status Disclosure Fields in Sex-Social Apps used by Gay and Bisexual Men,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Mark Warner  University College London Juan Fernando Maestre  Indiana University Bloomington Jo Gibbs  University College London Chia-Fang Chung  Indiana University Ann Blandford  University College London,"HIV status disclosure fields in online sex-social applications (""apps"") are designed to help increase awareness  reduce stigma  and promote sexual health. Public disclosure could also help those diagnosed relate to others with similar statuses to feel less isolated. However  in our interview study (n=28) with HIV positive and negative men who have sex with men (MSM)  we found some users preferred to keep their status private  especially when disclosure could stigmatise and disadvantage them  or risk revealing their status to someone they knew offline in a different context. How do users manage these tensions between health  stigma  and privacy? We analysed our interview data using signalling theory as a conceptual framework and identify participants developing 'signal appropriation' strategies  helping them manage the disclosure of their HIV status. Additionally  we propose a set of design considerations that explore the use of signals in the design of sensitive disclosure fields."
205,Local Standards for Anonymization Practices in Health  Wellness  Accessibility  and Aging Research at CHI,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Jacob Abbott  Indiana University Bloomington Haley MacLeod  Indiana University Bloomington Novia Nurain  Indiana University Bloomington Gustave Ekobe  Indiana University Bloomington Sameer Patil  Indiana University Bloomington,When studying technologies pertaining to health  wellness  accessibility  and aging  researchers are often required to perform a balancing act between controlling and sharing sensitive data of the people in their studies and protecting the privacy of these participants. If the data can be anonymized and shared  it can boost the impact of the research by facilitating replication and extension. Despite anonymization  data reporting and sharing may lead to re-identification of participants  which can be particularly problematic when the research deals with sensitive topics  such as health. We analyzed 509 CHI papers in the domains of health  wellness  accessibility  and aging to examine data reporting and sharing practices. Our analysis revealed notable patterns and trends regarding the reporting of age  gender  participant types  sample sizes  methodology  ethical considerations  anonymization techniques  and data sharing. Based on our findings  we propose several suggestions for community standards and practices that could facilitate data reporting and sharing while limiting the privacy risks for study participants.
206,"Emotion and Experience in Negotiating HIV-Related Digital Resources: ""It's not just a runny nose!""",Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Aneesha Singh  University College London Jo Gibbs  University College London Ann Blandford  University College London,While digital technologies are increasingly being used to provide support and diagnoses remotely  it is unclear whether they offer adequate emotional support and appropriate messages in navigating complex  stigmatised and sensitive conditions that can have a momentous impact on people's lives. In this paper  we investigate how and why people access existing HIV resources  and their experiences of using these resources through a survey with 197 respondents and an interview and think-aloud study with 28 participants. Our findings indicate that many HIV-related resources do not address the anxiety-provoking reasons for access  reinforce stigma and neglect to provide important information and emotional support. We finally discuss potential ways of addressing these issues in the current environment where more sexual health services are being delivered online.
207,This Girl is on Fire Sensemaking in an Online Health Community for Vulvodynia,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Dochart 2,Alyson L. Young  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Andrew D. Miller  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,Online health communities (OHCs) allow people living with a shared diagnosis or medical condition to connect with peers for social support and advice. OHCs have been well studied in conditions like diabetes and cancer  but less is known about their role in enigmatic diseases with unknown or complex causal mechanisms. In this paper  we study one such condition: Vulvodynia  a chronic pain syndrome of the vulvar region. Through observations of and interviews with members of a vulvodynia Facebook group  we found that while the interaction types are broadly similar to those found in other OHCs  the women spent more time seeking basic information and building individualized management plans. They also encounter significant emotional and interpersonal challenges  which they discuss with each other. We use this study to extend the field's understanding of OHCs  and to propose implications for the design of self-tracking tools to support sensemaking in enigmatic conditions.

209,SIGCHI Lifetime Research Award Talk: Making Digital Tangible,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Forth,Hiroshi Ishii  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Today's mainstream Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research primarily addresses functional concerns – the needs of users  practical applications  and usability evaluation. Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms are driven by vision and carried out with an artistic approach. While today's technologies will become obsolete in one year  and today's applications will be replaced in 10 years  true visions – we believe – can last longer than 100 years. Tangible Bits (3  4) seeks to realize seamless interfaces between humans  digital information  and the physical environment by giving physical form to digital information and computation  making bits directly manipulatable and perceptible both in the foreground and background of our consciousness (peripheral awareness). Our goal is to invent new design media for artistic expression as well as for scientific analysis  taking advantage of the richness of human senses and skills we develop throughout our lifetime interacting with the physical world  as well as the computational reflection enabled by real-time sensing and digital feedback. Radical Atoms (5) leaps beyond Tangible Bits by assuming a hypothetical generation of materials that can change form and properties dynamically  becoming as reconfigurable as pixels on a screen. Radical Atoms is the future material that can transform its shape  conform to constraints  and inform the users of their affordances. Radical Atoms is a vision for the future of Human-Material Interaction  in which all digital information has a physical manifestation  thus enabling us to interact directly with it.
210,SIGCHI Lifetime Practice Award Talk The Business of UX,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Forth,Daniel J. Rosenberg  San Jose State University,"After four decades of practice  User Experience design has reached a maturity level integral to the success of every business venture. Whether the product or service provided competes in the consumer  enterprise or medical sector  UX quality is known to directly impact effectiveness  efficiency and satisfaction  the combination of which determines consumer acceptance. However  great design alone is not sufficient to achieve meaningful impact. Products with high usability lab ratings have been rejected in the crucible of real-life usage because they don't add sufficient value for either the consumer or company that delivers them to market. The failure of these so called ""great designs"" reduces them at best to museum or portfolio pieces. True impact is only achieved when the designed artifact reaches a critical level of market adoption. The service benchmarks today are Facebook with over two billion active users and Google with 1.2 trillion searches a year. Achieving significant market adoption is difficult. It requires not only delightfully fulfilling users' needs but also a UX strategy and design optimization to fit corporate business models and marketing channels  both characterized by substantial financial risk. If there is no ROI for the product  then by association there is no ROI for design or the UX team itself. UX earns a ""seat at the table"" by simultaneously delivering value for both the business and the user. Owning the Business of UX role contains strategy and management challenges. Mastering them can bring UX to corporate parity with the more established engineering and marketing professions."
211,Monotasking or Multitasking: Designing for Crowdworkers' Preferences,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Gala,Laura Lascau  University College London Sandy J. J. Gould  University of Birmingham Anna L. Cox  University College London Elizaveta Karmannaya  University College London Duncan P. Brumby  University College London,Crowdworkers receive no formal training for managing their tasks  time or working environment. To develop tools that support such workers  an understanding of their preferences and the constraints they are under is essential. We asked 317 experienced Amazon Mechanical Turk workers about factors that influence their task and time management. We found that a large number of the crowdworkers score highly on a measure of polychronicity; this means that they prefer to frequently switch tasks and happily accommodate regular work and non-work interruptions. While a preference for polychronicity might equip people well to deal with the structural demands of crowdworking platforms  we also know that multitasking negatively affects workers' productivity. This puts crowdworkers' working preferences into conflict with the desire of requesters to maximize workers' productivity. Combining the findings of prior research with the new knowledge obtained from our participants  we enumerate practical design options that could enable workers  requesters and platform developers to make adjustments that would improve crowdworkers' experiences.
212,Cicero: Multi-Turn  Contextual Argumentation for Accurate Crowdsourcing,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Gala,Quanze Chen  University of Washington Jonathan Bragg  University of Washington Lydia B. Chilton  Columbia University Dan S. Weld  University of Washington,Traditional approaches for ensuring high quality crowdwork have failed to achieve high-accuracy on difficult problems. Aggregating redundant answers often fails on the hardest problems when the majority is confused. Argumentation has been shown to be effective in mitigating these drawbacks. However  existing argumentation systems only support limited interactions and show workers general justifications  not context-specific arguments targeted to their reasoning. This paper presents Cicero  a new workflow that improves crowd accuracy on difficult tasks by engaging workers in multi-turn  contextual discussions through real-time  synchronous argumentation. Our experiments show that compared to previous argumentation systems which only improve the average individual worker accuracy by 6.8 percentage points on the Relation Extraction domain  our workflow achieves 16.7 percentage point improvement. Furthermore  previous argumentation approaches don't apply to tasks with many possible answers; in contrast  Cicero works well in these cases  raising accuracy from 66.7% to 98.8% on the Codenames domain.
213,Rehumanized Crowdsourcing: A Labeling Framework Addressing Bias and Ethics in Machine Learning,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Gala,Natã M. Barbosa  Syracuse University & Figure Eight Inc. Monchu Chen  Figure Eight Technologies  INC.,The increased use of machine learning in recent years led to large volumes of data being manually labeled via crowdsourcing microtasks completed by humans. This brought about dehumanization effects  namely  when task requesters overlook the humans behind the task  leading to issues of ethics (e.g.  unfair payment) and amplification of human biases  which are transferred into training data and affect machine learning in the real world. We propose a framework that allocates microtasks considering human factors of workers such as demographics and compensation. We deployed our framework to a popular crowdsourcing platform and conducted experiments with 1 919 workers collecting 160 345 human judgments. By routing microtasks to workers based on demographics and appropriate pay  our framework mitigates biases in the contributor sample and increases the hourly pay given to contributors. We discuss potential extensions and how it can promote transparency in crowdsourcing.
214,The Gendered Geography of Contributions to OpenStreetMap: Complexities in Self-Focus Bias,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Gala,Maitraye Das  Northwestern University Brent Hecht  Northwestern University Darren Gergle  Northwestern University,Millions of people worldwide contribute content to peer production repositories that serve human information needs and provide vital world knowledge to prominent artificial intelligence systems. Yet  extreme gender participation disparities exist in which men significantly outnumber women. A central concern has been that due to self-focus bias  these disparities can lead to corresponding gender content disparities  in which content of interest to men is better represented than content of interest to women. This paper investigates the relationship between participation and content disparities in OpenStreetMap. We replicate findings that women are dramatically under-represented as OSM contributors  and observe that men and women contribute different types of content and do so about different places. However  the character of these differences confound simple narratives about self-focus bias: we find that on a proportional basis  men produced a higher proportion of contributions in feminized spaces compared to women  while women produced a higher proportion of contributions in masculinized spaces compared to men.
215,Multilayer Haptic Feedback for Pen-Based Tablet Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Ernst Kruijff  Simon Fraser University & University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg Saugata Biswas  Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences Christina Trepkowski  Institute of Visual Computing Jens Maiero  Institue of Visual Computing George Ghinea  Brunel University London Wolfgang Stuerzlinger  Simon Fraser University,We present a novel  multilayer interaction approach that enables state transitions between spatially above-screen and 2D on-screen feedback layers. This approach supports the exploration of haptic features that are hard to simulate using rigid 2D screens. We accomplish this by adding a haptic layer above the screen that can be actuated and interacted with (pressed on) while the user interacts with on-screen content using pen input. The haptic layer provides variable firmness and contour feedback  while its membrane functionality affords additional tactile cues like texture feedback. Through two user studies  we look at how users can use the layer in haptic exploration tasks  showing that users can discriminate well between different firmness levels  and can perceive object contour characteristics. Demonstrated also through an art application  the results show the potential of multilayer feedback to extend on-screen feedback with additional widget  tool and surface properties  and for user guidance.
216,Magnetact: Magnetic-sheet-based Haptic Interfaces for Touch Devices,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Kentaro Yasu  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,We describe a method for rapid prototyping of haptic interfaces for touch devices. A sheet-like touch interface is constructed from magnetic rubber sheets and conductive materials. The magnetic sheet is thin  and the capacitive sensor of the touch device can still detect the user's finger above the sheet because of the rubber's dielectric nature. Furthermore  tactile feedback can be customized with ease by using our magnetizing toolkit to change the magnetic patterns. Using the magnetizing toolkit  we investigated the appropriate size and thickness of haptic interfaces and demonstrated several interfaces such as buttons  sliders  switches  and dials. Our method is an easy and convenient way to customize the size  shape  and haptic feedback of a wide variety of interfaces.
217,Aarnio: Passive Kinesthetic Force Output for Foreground Interactions on an Interactive Chair,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Shan-Yuan Teng  National Taiwan University Da-Yuan Huang  National Chiao Tung University Chi Wang  National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Jun Gong  Dartmouth College Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary Xing-Dong Yang  Dartmouth College Bing-Yu Chen  National Taiwan University,We propose a new type of haptic output for foreground interactions on an interactive chair  where input is carried out explicitly in the foreground of the user's consciousness. This type of force output restricts a user's motion by modulating the resistive force when rotating a seat  tilting the backrest  or rolling the chair. These interactions are useful for many applications in a ubiquitous computing environment  ranging from immersive VR games to rapid and private query of information for people who are occupied with other tasks (e.g. in a meeting). We carefully designed and implemented our proposed haptic force output on a standard office chair and determined the recognizability of five force profiles for rotating  tilting  and rolling the chair. We present the result of our studies  as well as a set of novel interaction techniques enabled by this new force output for chairs.
218,HaptiVec: Presenting Haptic Feedback Vectors in Handheld Controllers using Embedded Tactile Pin Arrays,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 1,Daniel K.Y. Chen  Shanghai Jiao Tong University Jean-Baptiste Chossat  Shanghai Jiao Tong University Peter B. Shull  Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"HaptiVec is a new haptic feedback paradigm for handheld controllers which allows users to feel directional haptic pressure vectors on their fingers and hands while interacting with virtual environments. We embed a 3 by 5 tactile pin array (with an average pin spacing of 25 mm) into the handles of two custom VR type controllers. By presenting directional pressure vectors in eight cardinal directions (N  NE  E  SE  S  SW  W  NW) to users without prior training  they were able to distinguish the correct direction with an accuracy of at least 79%. We illustrate two applications where our device enhances virtual experiences over traditional vibrotactile feedback. In the first application  through the classic first-person shooter Doom  we demonstrate that users can receive directional pressure feedback corresponding to the direction of incident enemy projectiles. In the second application  we demonstrate how our controller can create a more immersive experience by allowing the user to feel their virtual climate by randomizing the directional vectors and presenting the user with ""haptic rain"" which adapts with the intensity of the rainfall."
219,Context-Informed Scheduling and Analysis: Improving Accuracy of Mobile Self-Reports,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Niels van Berkel  The University of Melbourne Jorge Goncalves  The University of Melbourne Peter Koval  The University of Melbourne Simo Hosio  University of Oulu Tilman Dingler  University of Melbourne Denzil Ferreira  University of Oulu Vassilis Kostakos  University of Melbourne,Mobile self-reports are a popular technique to collect participant labelled data in the wild. While literature has focused on increasing participant compliance to self-report questionnaires  relatively little work has assessed response accuracy. In this paper  we investigate how participant context can affect response accuracy and help identify strategies to improve the accuracy of mobile self-report data. In a 3-week study we collect over 2 500 questionnaires containing both verifiable and non-verifiable questions. We find that response accuracy is higher for questionnaires that arrive when the phone is not in ongoing or very recent use. Furthermore  our results show that long completion times are an indicator of a lower accuracy. Using contextual mechanisms readily available on smartphones  we are able to explain up to 13% of the variance in participant accuracy. We offer actionable recommendations to assist researchers in their future deployments of mobile self-report studies.
220,Investigating the Effect of Orientation and Visual Style on Touchscreen Slider Performance,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Ashley Colley  University of Lapland Sven Mayer  University of Stuttgart Niels Henze  University of Regensburg,Sliders are one of the most fundamental components used in touchscreen user interfaces (UIs). When entering data using a slider  errors occur due e.g. to visual perception  resulting in inputs not matching what is intended by the user. However  it is unclear if the errors occur uniformly across the full range of the slider or if there are systematic offsets. We conducted a study to assess the errors occurring when entering values with horizontal and vertical sliders as well as two common visual styles. Our results reveal significant effects of slider orientation and style on the precision of the entered values. Furthermore  we identify systematic offsets that depend on the visual style and the target value. As the errors are partially systematic  they can be compensated to improve users' precision. Our findings provide UI designers with data to optimize user experiences in the wide variety of application areas where slider based touchscreen input is used.
221,LocknType: Lockout Task Intervention for Discouraging Smartphone App Use,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Jaejeung Kim  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Joonyoung Park  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Hyunsoo Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Minsam Ko  Hanyang University Uichin Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Instant access and gratification make it difficult for us to self-limit the use of smartphone apps. We hypothesize that a slight increase in the interaction cost of accessing an app could successfully discourage app use. We propose a proactive intervention that requests users to perform a simple lockout task (e.g.  typing a fixed length number) whenever a target app is launched. We investigate how a lockout task with varying workloads (i.e.  pause only without number input  10-digit input  and 30-digit input) influence a user's decision making  by a 3-week  in-situ experiment with 40 participants. Our findings show that even the pause-only task that requires a user to press a button to proceed discouraged an average of 13.1% of app use  and the 30-digit-input task discouraged 47.5%. We derived determinants of app use and non-use decision making for a given lockout task. We further provide implications for persuasive technology design for discouraging undesired behaviors.
222,Diagnosing and Coping with Mode Errors in Korean-English Dual-language Keyboard,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Hall 2,Sangyoon Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Jaeyeon Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Geehyuk Lee  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,In countries where languages with non-Latin characters are prevalent  people use a keyboard with two language modes namely  the native language and English  and often experience mode errors. To diagnose the mode error problem  we conducted a field study and observed that 78% of the mode errors occurred immediately after application switching. We implemented four methods (Auto-switch  Preview  Smart-toggle  and Preview & Smart-toggle) based on three strategies to deal with the mode error problem and conducted field studies to verify their effectiveness. In the studies considering Korean-English dual input  Auto-switch was ineffective. On the contrary  Preview significantly reduced the mode errors from 75.1% to 41.3%  and Smart-toggle saved typing cost for recovering from mode errors. In Preview & Smart-toggle  Preview reduced mode errors and Smart-toggle handled 86.2% of the mode errors that slipped past Preview. These results suggest that Preview & Smart-toggle is a promising method for preventing mode errors for the Korean-English dual-input environment.

Walter Lee  University of Minnesota,Augmenting grassroots community policing (CP) efforts with technologies that assist citizens is a promising strategy for reducing real and perceived fear of crime. We used a human-centered design approach  working with residents of the St. Paul Summit-University neighborhood  to discern abstract functionalities for developing new CP technology. We then created and evaluated NeighBoard (Figure 1)  which aims to enhance the social fabric of communities by letting citizens implement their own strategies for preventing crime and maintaining safety in their neighborhood.

Joseph  National Institute of Design Lamha Bijili  National Institute of Design Md. Aasif Anwar  National Institute of Design Urvi  National Institute of Design,The current Indian education system promotes competition among students  emphasizing highly on ranks and marks scored. As a consequence  students tend to drift away from a collaborative mindset to a competitive one. The learning gap is even larger in schools catering to lower income groups due to the absence of digital infrastructure and digital knowledge. As a result  a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge  the internet  causing the gap to increase between students in the society. With co ed  we attempt to bridge these gaps by providing a platform to foster mutual learning as well as combining digital mediums and the long-established pen and paper in a seamless manner.
226,SDC03: Drawxi: An Accessible Drawing Tool for Collaboration,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Suraj Chiplunkar  Indiana University Anany Maini  Indiana University Dinesh Ram  Indiana University Zixuan Zheng  Indiana University Yaxin Zheng  Indiana University Bloomington,Visual impairment can profoundly impact well-being and social advancement. Current solutions for accessing graphical information fail to provide an affordable  user-friendly collaborative platform for visually impaired and sighted people to work together. Therefore  sighted users tend to have low expectations from visually impaired people while working in a team. Hence  visually impaired people feel discouraged to participate in a mixed population collaborative environment. Consequently  their generative capabilities remain devalued. In this paper  we propose an audio-haptic enabled tool (Drawxi) for free-form sketching and sharing simple diagrams (processes  workflows  ideas  perspectives  etc.). It provides a common platform for visually-impaired and sighted people to work together by communicating each other's ideas visually. Thus  enabling the discovery of generative capabilities in a hands-on way. We relied upon participatory research methods (Contextual inquiry  Co-Design) involving visually impaired participants throughout the design process. We evaluated our proposed design through usability testing which revealed that collaboration between visually impaired and sighted people benefits from the use of common tools and platforms. Thereby  enhancing the degree of their participation in a collaborative environment and quality of co-creation activities.

While people are constantly suffering from body shape anxiety  they do not realize that beauty standard is not an absolute truth and that it is changing and depends on time and space. To help people free from the constraint imposed by social beauty standards and connect those who have concerns over their body shape  we devised a technological solution named ""Shadoji""  which can bring people a new perspective on their body shapes  give them a chance to create their unique body shape emoji  and to explore diverse body shapes from users around the world."

We collected data through 18 semi-structured interviews with primary family and respite caregivers and qualitatively analyzed the interviews to extract common needs. Participants identified three main needs that our designs address: building trust through status updates  learning routines & care management  and accessing technology. Based on those needs  we designed a prototype of an application which connects primary family caregivers with respite caregivers and facilitates communication between the involved parties. This design can serve as a framework for future work designed to improve elder care in general  the well-being of caregivers  and the effectiveness of respite care.

Sharing feelings  emotions  thoughts  activities  and even finances enables couples to spend quality time with each other. In particular  financial management plays an important role in relationship quality of emerging adult couples. We present Amor  a mobile application that bridges emerging adult couples closely to pool and spend their money together for a common goal. Amor also allows the couples to explore activities that harmonize with their characteristics as well as an encouragement for the two to achieve their desired goals.

Reconnect with Yourself to Better Connect with Others,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Audrey Drolet  Université Laval Thomas Lemonde-Marzell  Université Laval Pablo Matos Da Silva  Université Laval Kim Lamontagne  Université Laval Marjorie Bédard  Université Laval,Occidental societies are becoming increasingly demanding. Citizens often feel overwhelmed and feel the need to rest  which they do so by isolating themselves from others. Individuals who use this time alone to reflect on their situation find that this reflection helps create deeper connections with others afterwards. With this in mind  we developed Senti?  a solution that aims to encourage people to take time for themselves in hopes that it will lead them to be more open-minded when interacting with others. The solution helps people focus on bodily sensations and generates a comfortable and effortless time for introspection. Senti? uses the subconscious benefits of perceiving one's heartbeat to foster personal reflection.

Care staff and family members want to be able to connect with residents/loved ones but have limitations (time constraints  unsure how)  and it can be challenging to feel a connection to another resident who has differing abilities. We propose that through sharing strong positive memories  members of a nursing home community (residents  care staff  and families) will be able to build empathy for one another and thus strengthen their community bonds. By applying multi-modal technologies to a familiar medium  the book  we provided a means by which intergenerational users  from various backgrounds  could interact with and gain meaning from the content.

Loss of local activities and mobility may leave children prepared for transitions to adulthood and make them less independent and may have negative health effects. In this paper  we discuss the findings of our research on children's unsupervised play in their neighborhoods. We propose HelloBox  a system including an app  wearable RFID tags  and check-in stations to keep track of children when they are outside without an adult. HelloBox lets parents know where their children are without restricting their independence and builds community between local families. The project focuses on improving children's independent mobility and encouraging social interactions between families within neighborhoods.
233,SDC10: HearU: An Integrated System to Raise Awareness of Hearing Loss,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Beijia Wang  University of Washington Mengxiao Song  University of Washington Yuting Han  University of Washington Duo Wang  University of Washington,Hearing loss is a prevalent public health crisis that often goes unnoticed in public eye due to its invisibility. People who are hard of hearing (HH) often experience social isolation caused by the lack of understanding from the hearing community. Our research revealed that there is a communication gap between the hearing and HH communities. The current state of art tends to focus on assisting HH people to participate in conversations  which places more responsibility on the HH community. There is a lack of responsibility of people in the hearing community. However  communication works in two directions; it requires both parties to take responsibility. In this paper  we present HearU - an integrated  multichannel system that includes public interaction. Through the creation of an immersive experience that increases people's awareness of hearing loss  we aim to use HearU as a medium to weave these two communities together as a whole.

Our research found that people with ALS express a lack of connection with other people with the disease  and that the general public lacks awareness about ALS. We also identified an engagement problem with the currently available resources to connect and support people with ALS. To address these issues  we introduce 'PALS' - an accessible crowdsourcing and connection quilt  first hung like a tapestry in the ALS clinic  then later used as an interactive public display. The quilt offers the opportunity to access crowdsourced information concerning individual experiences of ALS. Our work offers three primary contributions: 1) adding to limited HCI research concerning the ALS community by establishing the needs  2) applying the 'PALS' quilt design solution to these needs  and 3) combining three modalities: crowdsourcing  tangible tapestry displays  and interactive waiting education in a unique way.
235,SDC12: TechBuddies: Engaging Students to Teach Retirees about Technology,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Island B CROWNE,Jim Philippe Neussl  University College London Rebecca Zheng  University College London George Hanson  University College London Boyin Yang  University College London,Retirees suffer from impaired mobility  loss of friends and family  and loneliness. Although these problems could be mitigated through the use of digital communication devices and the internet  many retirees lack the skill and confidence to use them effectively. The existing community initiatives that aim to help retirees understand technology often lack volunteers to teach them. This is why we developed TechBuddies  a two-component system aimed at engaging more students as volunteers. The first component consists of an interactive display that raises awareness about volunteering opportunities by simulating an interaction between a retiree and the potential volunteer. The second component involves an app-based platform that facilitates communication about events and encourages long-term engagement. TechBuddies raises awareness about and provides a platform for inter-generational interactions between students and retirees who are a part of the same local community.
236,Neighborhood Perception in Bar Charts,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Lomond,Mingqian Zhao  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Huamin Qu  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Michael Sedlmair  University of Stuttgart,In this paper  we report three user experiments that investigate in how far the perception of a bar in a bar chart changes based on the height of its neighboring bars. We hypothesized that the perception of the very same bar  for instance  might differ when it is surrounded by the top highest vs. the top lowest bars. Our results show that such neighborhood effects exist: a target bar surrounded by high neighbor bars  is perceived to be lower as the same bar surrounded with low neighbors. Yet  the effect size of this neighborhood effect is small compared to other data-inherent effects: the judgment accuracy largely depends on the target bar rank  number of data items  and other data characteristics of the dataset. Based on the findings  we discuss design implications for perceptually optimizing bar charts.
237,Ranked-List Visualization: A Graphical Perception Study,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Lomond,Pranathi Mylavarapu  University of Maryland  College Park Adil Yalcin  Keshif  LLC. Xan Gregg  SAS Institute  Inc. Niklas Elmqvist  University of Maryland  College Park,Visualization of ranked lists is a common occurrence  but many in-the-wild solutions fly in the face of vision science and visualization wisdom. For example  treemaps and bubble charts are commonly used for this purpose  despite the fact that the data is not hierarchical and that length is easier to perceive than area. Furthermore  several new visual representations have recently been suggested in this area  including wrapped bars  packed bars  piled bars  and Zvinca plots. To quantify the differences and trade-offs for these ranked-list visualizations  we here report on a crowdsourced graphical perception study involving six such visual representations  including the ubiquitous scrolled barchart  in three tasks: ranking (assessing a single item)  comparison (two items)  and average (assessing global distribution). Results show that wrapped bars may be the best choice for visualizing ranked lists  and that treemaps are surprisingly accurate despite the use of area rather than length to represent value.
238,Saliency Deficit and Motion Outlier Detection in Animated Scatterplots,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Lomond,Rafael Veras  University of Ontario Institute of Technology Christopher Collins  University of Ontario Institute of Technology,We report the results of a crowdsourced experiment that measured the accuracy of motion outlier detection in multivariate  animated scatterplots. The targets were outliers either in speed or direction of motion  and were presented with varying levels of saliency in dimensions that are irrelevant to the task of motion outlier detection (e.g.  color  size  position). We found that participants had trouble finding the outlier when it lacked irrelevant salient features and that visual channels contribute unevenly to the odds of an outlier being correctly detected. Direction of motion contributes the most to accurate detection of speed outliers  and position contributes the most to accurate detection of direction outliers. We introduce the concept of saliency deficit in which item importance in the data space is not reflected in the visualization due to a lack of saliency. We conclude that motion outlier detection is not well supported in multivariate animated scatterplots.
239,Measuring the Separability of Shape  Size  and Color in Scatterplots,Monday  May 06  2019 - 14:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 15:20,Lomond,Stephen Smart  University of Colorado Boulder Danielle Albers Szafir  University of Colorado Boulder,Scatterplots commonly use multiple visual channels to encode multivariate datasets. Such visualizations often use size  shape  and color as these dimensions are considered separable--dimensions represented by one channel do not significantly interfere with viewers' abilities to perceive data in another. However  recent work shows the size of marks significantly impacts color difference perceptions  leading to broader questions about the separability of these channels. In this paper  we present a series of crowdsourced experiments measuring how mark shape  size  and color influence data interpretation in multiclass scatterplots. Our results indicate that mark shape significantly influences color and size perception  and that separability among these channels functions asymmetrically: shape more strongly influences size and color perceptions in scatterplots than size and color influence shape. Models constructed from the resulting data can help designers anticipate viewer perceptions to build more effective visualizations.

Such a system can enable easy and large-scale deployment for multi-user tracking and sensing without the need for additional sensors through the use of existing WiFi devices (e.g.  desktops  laptops and smart appliances). The basic idea is to identify and extract the signal reflection corresponding to each individual user with the help of multiple WiFi links and all the available WiFi channels at 5GHz. Given the extracted signal reflection of each user  MultiTrack examines the path of the reflected signals at multiple links to simultaneously track multiple users. It further reconstructs the signal profile of each user as if only a single user has performed activity in the environment to facilitate multi-user activity recognition. We evaluate MultiTrack in different multipath environments with up to 4 users for multi-user tracking and up to 3 users for activity recognition. Experimental results show that our system can achieve decimeter localization accuracy and over 92% activity recognition accuracy under multi-user scenarios.
243,SurfaceSight: A New Spin on Touch  User  and Object Sensing for IoT Experiences,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 1,Gierad Laput  Carnegie Mellon University Chris Harrison  Carnegie Mellon University,"IoT appliances are gaining consumer traction  from smart thermostats to smart speakers. These devices generally have limited user interfaces  most often small buttons and touchscreens  or rely on voice control. Further  these devices know little about their surroundings – unaware of objects  people and activities happening around them. Consequently  interactions with these ""smart"" devices can be cumbersome and limited. We describe SurfaceSight  an approach that enriches IoT experiences with rich touch and object sensing  offering a complementary input channel and increased contextual awareness. For sensing  we incorporate LIDAR into the base of IoT devices  providing an expansive  ad hoc plane of sensing just above the surface on which devices rest. We can recognize and track a wide array of objects  including finger input and hand gestures. We can also track people and estimate which way they are facing. We evaluate the accuracy of these new capabilities and illustrate how they can be used to power novel and contextually-aware interactive experiences."

For example  social researchers are interested in studying domestic abuse  and healthcare professionals are interested in caregiver-patient interaction. Today  such studies rely on diaries and questionnaires  which are subjective  erroneous  and hard to sustain in longitudinal studies. We introduce Marko  a system that automatically collects behavior-related data  without asking people to write diaries or wear sensors. Marko transmits a low power wireless signal and analyses its reflections from the environment. It maps those reflections to how users interact with the environment (e.g.  access to medication cabinet) and with each other (e.g.  watch TV together). It provides novel algorithms for identifying who-does-what  and bootstrapping the system in new homes without asking users for new annotations. We evaluate Marko with a one-month deployment in six homes  and demonstrate its value for studying couple relationships and caregiver-patient interaction.
245,MilliSonic: Pushing the Limits of Acoustic Motion Tracking,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 1,Anran Wang  University of Washington Shyamnath Gollakota  University of Washington,Recent years have seen interest in device tracking and localization using acoustic signals. State-of-the-art acoustic motion tracking systems however do not achieve millimeter accuracy and require large separation between microphones and speakers  and as a result  do not meet the requirements for many VR/AR applications. Further  tracking multiple concurrent acoustic transmissions from VR devices today requires sacrificing accuracy or frame rate. We present MilliSonic  a novel system that pushes the limits of acoustic based motion tracking. Our core contribution is a novel localization algorithm that can provably achieve sub-millimeter 1D tracking accuracy in the presence of multipath  while using only a single beacon with a small 4-microphone array.Further  MilliSonic enables concurrent tracking of up to four smartphones without reducing frame rate or accuracy. Our evaluation shows that MilliSonic achieves 0.7mm median 1D accuracy and a 2.6mm median 3D accuracy for smartphones  which is 5x more accurate than state-of-the-art systems. MilliSonic enables two previously infeasible interaction applications: a) 3D tracking of VR headsets using the smartphone as a beacon and b) fine-grained 3D tracking for the Google Cardboard VR system using a small microphone array.

Gordon  Stanford University Shumin Zhai  Google,We study the effects of haptic augmentation on tapping  path following  and drag & drop tasks based on a recent flagship smartphone with refined touch sensing and haptic actuator technologies. Results show actuated haptic confirmation on tapping targets was subjectively appreciated by some users but did not improve tapping speed or accuracy. For drag & drop  a clear performance improvement was measured when haptic feedback is applied to target boundary crossing  particularly when the targets are small. For path following tasks  virtual haptic feedback improved accuracy at a reduced speed in a sitting condition. Stronger results were achieved in a physical haptic mock-up. Overall  we found actuated touchscreen haptic feedback particularly effective when the touched object was visually interfered by the finger. Participants subjective experience of haptic feedback in all tasks tended to be more positive than their time or accuracy performance suggests. We compare and discuss these findings with previous results on early generations of devices. The work provides an empirical foundation to product design and future research of touch input and haptic systems.
247,Effect of Orientation on Unistroke Touch Gestures,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Sven Mayer  University of Stuttgart Valentin Schwind  University of Stuttgart Huy Viet Le  University of Stuttgart Dominik Weber  University of Stuttgart Jonas Vogelsang  University of Stuttgart Johannes Wolf  University of Stuttgart Niels Henze  University of Regensburg,As touchscreens are the most successful input method of current mobile devices  touch gestures became a widely used input technique. While gestures provide users with advantages to express themselves  they also introduce challenges regarding accuracy and memorability. In this paper  we investigate the effect of a gesture's orientation on how well the gesture can be performed. We conducted a study in which participants performed systematically rotated unistroke gestures. For straight lines as well as for compound lines  we found that users tend to align gestures with the primary axes. We show that the error can be described by a Clausen function with R² = .93. Based on our findings  we suggest design implications and highlight the potential for recognizing flick gestures  visualizing gestures and improving recognition of compound gestures.
248,An Evaluation of Touch Input at the Edge of a Table,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Nikhita Joshi  University of Waterloo Daniel Vogel  University of Waterloo,Tables  desks  and counters are often nearby  motivating their use as interactive surfaces. However  they are typically cluttered. As an alternative  we explore touch input along the 'edge' of table-like surfaces. The performance of tapping  crossing  and dragging is tested along the two ridges and front face of a table edge. Results show top ridge movement time is comparable to the top face when tapping or dragging. When crossing  both ridges are at least 11% faster than the top face. Effective width analysis is used to model performance and provide recommended target sizes. Based on observed user behaviour  variations of top and bottom ridge crossing are explored in a second study  and design recommendations with example applications are provided.
249,Modeling Fully and Partially Constrained Lasso Movements in a Grid of Icons,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Alsh 2,Shota Yamanaka  Yahoo Japan Corporation Wolfgang Stuerzlinger  Simon Fraser University,Lassoing objects is a basic function in illustration software and presentation tools. Yet  for many common object arrangements lassoing is sometimes time-consuming to perform and requires precise pen operation. In this work  we studied lassoing movements in a grid of objects similar to icons. We propose a quantitative model to predict the time to lasso such objects depending on the margins between icons  their sizes  and layout  which all affect the number of stopping and crossing movements. Results of two experiments showed that our models predict fully and partially constrained movements with high accuracy. We also analyzed the speed profiles and pen stroke trajectories and identified deeper insights into user behaviors  such as that an unconstrained area can induce higher movement speeds even in preceding path segments.

253,PersonalTouch: Improving Touchscreen Usability by Personalizing Accessibility Settings based on Individual User's Touchscreen Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 1,Yi-Hao Peng  National Taiwan University Muh-Tarng Lin  National Taiwan University Yi Chen  National Taiwan University TzuChuan Chen  National Taiwan University Pin Sung Ku  National Taiwan University Paul Taele  Texas A&M University Chin Guan Lim  National Taiwan University Mike Y. Chen  National Taiwan University,Modern touchscreen devices have recently introduced customizable touchscreen settings to improve accessibility for users with motor impairments. For example  iOS 10 introduced the following four Touch Accommodation settings: 1) Hold Duration  2) Ignore Repeat  3) Tap Assistance  and 4) Tap Assistance Gesture Delay. These four independent settings lead to a total of more than 1 million possible configurations  making it impractical to manually determine the optimal settings. We present PersonalTouch  which collects and analyzes touchscreen gestures performed by individual users  and recommends personalized  optimal touchscreen accessibility settings. Results from our user study show that PersonalTouch significantly improves touch input success rate for users with motor impairments (20.2%  N=12  p=.00054) and for users without motor impairments (1.28%  N=12  p=.032).
254,Cluster Touch: Improving Touch Accuracy on Smartphones for People with Motor and Situational Impairments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 1,Martez E. Mott  University of Washington Jacob O. Wobbrock  University of Washington,We present Cluster Touch  a combined user-independent and user-specific touch offset model that improves the accuracy of touch input on smartphones for people with motor impairments  and for people experiencing situational impairments while walking. Cluster Touch combines touch examples from multiple users to create a shared user-independent touch model  which is then updated with touch examples provided by an individual user to make it user-specific. Owing to this combination  Cluster Touch allows people to quickly improve the accuracy of their smartphones by providing only 20 touch examples. In a user study with 12 people with motor impairments and 12 people without motor impairments  but who were walking  Cluster Touch improved touch accuracy by 14.65% for the former group and 6.81% for the latter group over the native touch sensor. Furthermore  in an offline analysis of existing mobile interfaces  Cluster Touch improved touch accuracy by 8.21% and 4.84% over the native touch sensor for the two user groups  respectively.
255,Accessible Gesture Typing for Non-Visual Text Entry on Smartphones,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 1,Syed Masum Billah  Stony Brook University Yu-Jung Ko  Stony Brook University Vikas Ashok  Stony Brook University Xiaojun Bi  Stony Brook University IV Ramakrishnan  Stony Brook University,Gesture typing--entering a word by gliding the finger sequentially over letter to letter-- has been widely supported on smartphones for sighted users. However  this input paradigm is currently inaccessible to blind users: it is difficult to draw shape gestures on a virtual keyboard without access to key visuals. This paper describes the design of accessible gesture typing  to bring this input paradigm to blind users. To help blind users figure out key locations  the design incorporates the familiar screen-reader supported touch exploration that narrates the keys as the user drags the finger across the keyboard. The design allows users to seamlessly switch between exploration and gesture typing mode by simply lifting the finger. Continuous touch-exploration like audio feedback is provided during word shape construction that helps the user glide in the right direction of the key locations constituting the word. Exploration mode resumes once word shape is completed. Distinct earcons help distinguish gesture typing mode from touch exploration mode  and thereby avoid unintended mix-ups. A user study with 14 blind people shows 35% increment in their typing speed  indicative of the promise and potential of gesture typing technology for non-visual text entry.
256,Stroke-Gesture Input for People with Motor Impairments: Empirical Results & Research Roadmap,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 1,Radu-Daniel Vatavu  University Ştefan cel Mare of Suceava Ovidiu-Ciprian Ungurean  University Ştefan cel Mare of Suceava,We examine the articulation characteristics of stroke-gestures produced by people with upper body motor impairments on touchscreens as well as the accuracy rates of popular classification techniques  such as the $-family  to recognize those gestures. Our results on a dataset of 9 681 gestures collected from 70 participants reveal that stroke-gestures produced by people with motor impairments are recognized less accurately than the same gesture types produced by people without impairments  yet still accurately enough (93.0%) for practical purposes; are similar in terms of geometrical criteria to the gestures produced by people without impairments; but take considerably more time to produce (3.4s vs. 1.7s) and exhibit lower consistency (-49.7%). We outline a research roadmap for accessible gesture input on touchscreens for users with upper body motor impairments  and we make our large gesture dataset publicly available in the community.
257,Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Filip Škola  Faculty of Informatics  Masaryk University Fotis Liarokapis  Faculty of Informatics  Masaryk University,Virtual reality (VR) can be immersive to such a degree that users sometimes report feeling tactile sensations based on visualization of the touch  without any actual physical contact. This effect is not only interesting for studies of human perception  but can also be leveraged to improve the quality of VR by evoking tactile sensations without usage of specialized equipment. The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch  transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG)  that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain  as well as to identify its neural correlates. Results confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation  and some of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.
258,To Repeat or Not to Repeat? Redesigning Repeating Auditory Alarms Based on EEG Analysis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Yi-Chen Lee  National Chiao Tung University Fu-Yin Cherng  National Chiao Tung University Jung-Tai King  National Chaio Tung Univerity Wen-Chieh Lin  National Chiao Tung University,Auditory alarms that repeatedly interrupt users until they react are common  especially in the context of alarms. However  when an alarm repeats  our brains habituate to it and perceive it less and less  with reductions in both perception and attention-shifting: a phenomenon known as the repetition-suppression effect (RS). To retain users' perception and attention  this paper proposes and tests the use of pitch- and intensity-modulated alarms. Its experimental findings suggest that the proposed modulated alarms can reduce RS  albeit in different patterns  depending on whether pitch or intensity is the focus of the modulation. Specifically  pitch-modulated alarms were found to reduce RS more when the number of repetitions was small  while intensity-modulated alarms reduced it more as the number of repetitions increased. Based on these results  we make several recommendations for the design of improved repeating alarms  based on which modulation approach should be adopted in various situations.
259,Detecting Visuo-Haptic Mismatches in Virtual Reality using the Prediction Error Negativity of Event-Related Brain Potentials,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Lukas Gehrke  Technical University of Berlin Sezen Akman  Technical University of Berlin Pedro Lopes  University of Chicago & Hasso Plattner Institute  University of Potsdam Albert Chen  University of Chicago Avinash Kumar Singh  National Chiao Tung University Hsiang-Ting Chen  University of Technology Sydney Chin-Teng Lin  University of Technology Sydney Klaus Gramann  University of California  San Diego & Technische Universität Berlin,Designing immersion is the key challenge in virtual reality; this challenge has driven advancements in displays  rendering and recently  haptics. To increase our sense of physical immersion  for instance  vibrotactile gloves render the sense of touching  while electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) renders forces. Unfortunately  the established metric to assess the effectiveness of haptic devices relies on the user's subjective interpretation of unspecific  yet standardized  questions. Here  we explore a new approach to detect a conflict in visuo-haptic integration (e.g.  inadequate haptic feedback based on poorly configured collision detection) using electroencephalography (EEG). We propose analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) during interaction with virtual objects. In our study  participants touched virtual objects in three conditions and received either no haptic feedback  vibration  or vibration and EMS feedback. To provoke a brain response in unrealistic VR interaction  we also presented the feedback prematurely in 25% of the trials. We found that the early negativity component of the ERP (so called prediction error) was more pronounced in the mismatch trials  indicating we successfully detected haptic conflicts using our technique. Our results are a first step towards using ERPs to automatically detect visuo-haptic mismatches in VR  such as those that can cause a loss of the user's immersion.
260,Measuring the Influences of Musical Parameters on Cognitive and Behavioral Responses to Audio Notifications Using EEG and Large-scale Online Studies,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Boisdale 2,Fu-Yin Cherng  National Chiao Tung University Yi-Chen Lee  National Chiao Tung University Jung-Tai King  National Chaio Tung Univerity Wen-Chieh Lin  National Chiao Tung University,Prior studies have evaluated various designs for audio notifications. However  calls for more in-depth research on how such notifications work  especially at the level of users' cognitive states  have gone unanswered; and studies evaluating audio notifications with large numbers of participants in multiple environments have been rare. This study conducted an electroencephalography study (N=20) and an online study (N=967) to enhance understandings of how three musical parameters – melody (simple  complex)  pitch (high  low)  and tempo (fast  slow) – influenced users' cognition and behaviors. There are eight different notifications with different combinations of these parameters. The online study analyzed the effects of user-specific and environmental information on users' behaviors while they listened to these notifications. The results revealed that tempo and pitch have the main effect on the speed and strength (accuracy) of users' cognition and behaviors. The users' characteristics and environments influenced the effects of these musical parameters.
261,Personal Health Oracle: Explorations of Personalized Predictions in Diabetes Self-Management,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Pooja M. Desai  Columbia University Teachers College Elliot G. Mitchell  Columbia University Medical Center Maria L. Hwang  Fashion Institute of Technology Matthew E. Levine  California Institute of Technology David J. Albers  University of Colorado Medicine; Columbia University Medical Center Lena Mamykina  Columbia University Medical Center,The increasing availability of health data and knowledge about computationally modeling human physiology opens new opportunities for personalized predictions in health. Yet little is known about how individuals interact and reason with personalized predictions. To explore these questions  we developed a smartphone app  GlucOracle  that uses self-tracking data of individuals with type 2 diabetes to generate personalized forecasts for post-meal blood glucose levels. We pilot-tested GlucOracle with two populations: members of an online diabetes community  knowledgeable about diabetes and technologically savvy; and individuals from a low socio-economic status community  characterized by high prevalence of diabetes  low literacy and limited experience with mobile apps. Individuals in both communities engaged with personal glucose forecasts and found them useful for adjusting immediate meal options  and planning future meals. However  the study raised new questions as to appropriate time  form  and focus of forecasts and suggested new research directions for personalized predictions in health.
262,Communicating Uncertainty in Fertility Prognosis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Hanna Schneider  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Julia Wayrauther  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Mariam Hassib  Bundeswehr University Munich Andreas Butz  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich,Communicating uncertainty has been shown to provide positive effects on user understanding and decision-making. Surprisingly however  most personal health tracking applications fail to disclose the accuracy of their measurements and predictions. In the case of fertility tracking applications (FTAs)  inaccurate predictions have already led to numerous unwanted pregnancies and law suits. However  integrating uncertainty into FTAs is challenging: Prediction accuracy is hard to understand and communicate  and its effect on users' trust and behavior is not well understood. We created a prototype for uncertainty visualizations for FTAs and evaluated it in a four-week field study with real users and their own data (N=9). Our results uncover far-reaching effects of communicating uncertainty: For example  users interpreted prediction accuracy as a proxy for their cycle health and as a security indicator for contraception. Displaying predicted and detected fertile phases next to each other helped users to understand uncertainty without negative emotional effects.
263,A Wee Bit More Interaction: Designing and Evaluating an Overactive Bladder App,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Ana-Maria Salai  Heriot-Watt University Lynne Baillie  Heriot-Watt University,Overactive Bladder (OAB) is a widespread condition  affecting 20% of the population. Even though it is a treatable condition  people often do not seek treatment. In this paper  we describe how we co-designed and evaluated with 30 stakeholders (9 medical professionals and 21 end-users) an OAB mobile health application that aims to increase adherence to self-managed treatment. Our results support previous research that visualizing progress  setting goals  receiving reminders and feedback increases use. We discovered that games could be used successfully as a distraction technique for urge suppression. Contrary to the current research direction  automatically calculated features could be a detriment to app interaction. Regarding evaluation  we found that designers may not want to rely only on questionnaires when assessing the success of a game and its emotional impact on users.
264,My blood sugar is higher on the weekends: Finding a Role for Context and Context-Awareness in the Design of Health Self-Management Technology,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 1,Shriti Raj  University of Michigan Kelsey Toporski  University of Michigan Ashley Garrity  University of Michigan Joyce M. Lee  University of Michigan Mark W. Newman  University of Michigan,Tools for self-care of chronic conditions often do not fit the contexts in which self-care happens because the influence of context on self-care practices is unclear. We conducted a diary study with 15 adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes and their caregivers to understand how context affects self-care. We observed different contextual settings  which we call contextual frames  in which diabetes self-management varied depending on certain factors - physical activity  food  emotional state  insulin  people  and attitudes. The relative prevalence of these factors across contextual frames impacts self-care necessitating different types of support. We show that contextual frames  as phenomenological abstractions of context  can help designers of context-aware systems systematically explore and model the relation of context with behavior and with technology supporting behavior. Lastly  considering contextual frames as sensitizing concepts  we provide design direction for using context in technology design.
265,Springlets: Expressive  Flexible and Silent On-Skin Tactile Interfaces,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Nur Al-huda Hamdan  RWTH Aachen University Adrian Wagner  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jürgen Steimle  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,We introduce Springlets  expressive  non-vibrating mechanotactile interfaces on the skin. Embedded with shape memory alloy springs  we implement Springlets as thin and flexible stickers to be worn on various body locations  thanks to their silent operation even on the neck and head. We present a technically simple and rapid technique for fabricating a wide range of Springlet interfaces and computer-generated tactile patterns. We developed Springlets for six tactile primitives: pinching  directional stretching  pressing  pulling  dragging  and expanding. A study placing Springlets on the arm and near the head demonstrates Springlets' effectiveness and wearability in both stationary and mobile situations. We explore new interactive experiences in tactile social communication  physical guidance  health interfaces  navigation  and virtual reality gaming  enabled by Springlets' unique and scalable form factor.
266,Magnetips: Combining Fingertip Tracking and Haptic Feedback for Around-Device Interaction,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Jess McIntosh  University of Copenhagen Paul Strohmeier  University of Copenhagen Jarrod Knibbe  Monash University Sebastian Boring  University of Copenhagen Kasper Hornbæk  University of Copenhagen,Around-device interaction methods expand the available interaction space for mobile devices; however  there is currently no way to simultaneously track a user's input and provide haptic feedback at the tracked point away from the device. We present Magnetips  a simple  mobile solution for around-device tracking and mid-air haptic feedback. Magnetips combines magnetic tracking and electromagnetic feedback that works regardless of visual occlusion  through most common materials  and at a size that allows for integration with mobile devices. We demonstrate: (1) high-frequency around-device tracking and haptic feedback; (2) the accuracy and range of our tracking solution which corrects for the effects of geomagnetism  necessary for enabling mobile use; and (3) guidelines for maximising strength of haptic feedback  given a desired tracking frequency. We present technical and usability evaluations of our prototype  and demonstrate four example applications of its use.
267,Pulp Friction: Exploring the Finger Pad Periphery for Subtle Haptic Feedback,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Alix Goguey  Swansea University Deepak Ranjan Sahoo  Swansea University Simon Robinson  Swansea University Jennifer Pearson  Swansea University Matt Jones  Swansea University,Current haptic feedback techniques on handheld devices are applied to the finger pad or the palm of the user. These state-of-the-art approaches are coarse-grained and tend to be intrusive  rather than subtle. In contrast  we present a new feedback technique that applies stimuli around the periphery of the finger pulp  demonstrating how this can provide rich  nuanced haptic information. We use a reconfigurable haptic device employing a ferromagnetic marble for back-of-the device handheld use  which  for the first time  probes  without instrumenting the user  the periphery of the distal phalanx with localised stimulation. We present the design-space afforded by this new technique and evaluate the human-factors of finger-peripheral touch interaction in a controlled user-study. We report results with marbles of different diameters  speeds and a combination of poking  lateral vibration and patterns; present the resulting design guidelines for finger-periphery haptic feedback; and  illustrate its potential with use case scenarios.
268,Leveraging Distal Vibrotactile Feedback for Target Acquisition,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Carron 2,Jay Henderson  University of Waterloo Jeff Avery  University of Waterloo Laurent Grisoni  University of Lille Edward Lank  INRIA & University of Waterloo,Many touch based interactions provide limited opportunities for direct tactile feedback; examples include multi-user touch displays  augmented reality based projections on passive surfaces  and mid-air input. In this paper  we consider distal feedback  through vibrotactile stimulation on a smart-watch placed on the user's non-dominant wrist  as an alternative feedback mechanism to interaction location vibrotactile feedback  under the user's finger. We compare the effectiveness of interaction location feedback vs. distal feedback through a Fitts's Law task completed on a smartphone. Results show that distal and interaction location feedback both reduce errors in target acquisition and exhibit statistically comparable performance  suggesting that distal vibrotactile feedback is a suitable alternative when interaction location feedback is not readily available.
269,Sketching in HCI: Hands-on Course of Sketching Techniques,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Castle 1 CROWNE,Makayla Lewis  Brunel University London Miriam Sturdee  University of Calgary Nicolai Marquardt  University College London,Freehand sketching is a valuable process  input  output  and tool  often used by people to communicate and express ideas  as well as document  explore and describe concepts between researcher  user  or client. Sketches are fast  easy to create  and – by varying their fidelity – can be used in all areas of HCI. Sketching in HCI will explore and demonstrate themes around sketching in HCI with the aim of producing tangible outputs. Attendees will leave the course with the confidence to engage actively with sketching on an everyday basis in their research practice.
270,How to Write CHI Papers (Third Edition),Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Castle 2 CROWNE,Lennart E. Nacke  University of Waterloo,We base everything that we do as researchers on what we write. Primarily for graduate students and young researchers  it is hard to turn a research project into a successful CHI publication. This struggle continues for postdocs and young professors trying to author excellent reviews for the CHI community that pinpoint flaws and improvements in research papers. This third edition of the successful CHI paper writing course offers hands-on advice and more in-depth tutorials on how to write papers with clarity  substance  and style. It is structured into three 80-minute units with a focus on writing CHI papers.

272,SottoVoce: An Ultrasound Imaging-Based Silent Speech Interaction Using Deep Neural Networks,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Naoki Kimura  The University of Tokyo Michinari Kono  The University of Tokyo Jun Rekimoto  The University of Tokyo & Sony Computer Science Laboratories  Inc.,The availability of digital devices operated by voice is expanding rapidly. However  the applications of voice interfaces are still restricted. For example  speaking in public places becomes an annoyance to the surrounding people  and secret information should not be uttered. Environmental noise may reduce the accuracy of speech recognition. To address these limitations  a system to detect a user's unvoiced utterance is proposed. From internal information observed by an ultrasonic imaging sensor attached to the underside of the jaw  our proposed system recognizes the utterance contents without the user's uttering voice. Our proposed deep neural network model is used to obtain acoustic features from a sequence of ultrasound images. We confirmed that audio signals generated by our system can control the existing smart speakers. We also observed that a user can adjust their oral movement to learn and improve the accuracy of their voice recognition.
273,VoiceAssist: Guiding Users to High-Quality Voice Recordings,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Prem Seetharaman  Northwestern University Gautham J. Mysore  Adobe Research Bryan Pardo  Northwestern University Paris Smaragdis  University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Celso Gomes  Adobe Research,Voice recording is a challenging task with many pitfalls due to sub-par recording environments  mistakes in recording setup  microphone quality  etc. Newcomers to voice recording often have difficulty recording their voice  leading to recordings with low sound quality. Many amateur recordings of poor quality have two key problems: too much reverberation (echo)  and too much background noise (e.g. fans  electronics  street noise). We present VoiceAssist  a system that helps inexperienced users produce high quality recordings by providing real-time visual feedback on audio quality. We integrate modern audio quality measures into an interactive human-machine feedback loop  so that the audio quality can be maximized at capture-time. We demonstrate the utility of this feedback for improving the recording quality with a user study. When presented with visual feedback about recording quality  users produced recordings that were strongly preferred by third-party listeners  when compared to recordings made without this feedback.
274,Vocal Shortcuts for Creative Experts,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Yea-Seul Kim  University of Washington Mira Dontcheva  Adobe Research Eytan Adar  University of Michigan Jessica Hullman  Northwestern University,Vocal shortcuts  short spoken phrases to control interfaces  have the potential to reduce cognitive and physical costs of interactions. They may benefit expert users of creative applications (e.g.  designers  illustrators) by helping them maintain creative focus. To aid the design of vocal shortcuts and gather use cases and design guidelines for speech interaction  we interviewed ten creative experts. Based on our findings  we built VoiceCuts  a prototype implementation of vocal shortcuts in the context of an existing creative application. In contrast to other speech interfaces  VoiceCuts targets experts' unique needs by handling short and partial commands and leverages document model and application context to disambiguate user utterances. We report on the viability and limitations of our approach based on feedback from creative experts.
275,VARI-SOUND: A Varifocal Lens for Sound,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Clyde Auditorium,Gianluca Memoli  University of Sussex Letizia Chisari  University of Sussex Jonathan P. Eccles  University of Sussex Mihai Caleap  University of Bristol Bruce W. Drinkwater  University of Bristol Sriram Subramanian  University of Sussex,"Centuries of development in optics have given us passive devices (i.e. lenses  mirrors and filters) to enrich audience immersivity with light effects  but there is nothing similar for sound. Beam-forming in concert halls and outdoor gigs still requires a large number of speakers  while headphones are still the state-of-the-art for personalized audio immersivity in VR. In this work  we show how 3D printed acoustic meta-surfaces  assembled into the equivalent of optical systems  may offer a different solution. We demonstrate how to build them and how to use simple design tools  like the thin-lens equation  also for sound. We present some key acoustic devices  like a ""collimator""  to transform a standard computer speaker into an acoustic ""spotlight""; and a ""magnifying glass""  to create sound sources coming from distinct locations than the speaker itself. Finally  we demonstrate an acoustic varifocal lens  discussing applications equivalent to auto-focus cameras and VR headsets and the limitations of the technology."
276,Engaging High School Students in Cameroon with Exam Practice Quizzes via SMS and WhatsApp,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Anthony Poon  Cornell University Sarah Giroux  Cornell University Parfait Eloundou-Enyegue  Cornell University François Guimbretière  Cornell University Nicola Dell  Cornell Tech,We created a quiz-based intervention to help secondary school students in Cameroon with exam practice. We sent regularly-spaced  multiple-choice questions to students' own mobile devices and examined factors which influenced quiz participation. These quizzes were delivered via either SMS or WhatsApp per each student's preference. We conducted a 3-week deployment with 546 students at 3 schools during their month of independent study prior to their graduating exam. We found that participation rates were heavily impacted by trust in the intervening organization and perceptions of personal security in the socio-technical environment. Parents also played a key gate-keeping role on students' digital activities. We describe how this role - along with different perceptions of smartphones versus basic phones - may manifest in lower participation rates among WhatsApp-based users as compared to SMS. Finally  we discuss design implications for future educational interventions that target students' personal cellphones outside of the classroom.
277,Voice-Based Quizzes for Measuring Knowledge Retention in Under-Connected Populations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Agha Ali Raza  Information Technology University Zain Tariq  Information Technology University Shan Randhawa  Information Technology University Bilal Saleem  Information Technology University Awais Athar  European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) Umar Saif  Information Technology University Roni Rosenfeld  Carnegie Mellon University,Information dissemination using automated phone calls allows reaching low-literate and tech-naive populations. Open challenges include rapid verification of expected knowledge gaps in the community  dissemination of specific information to address these gaps  and follow-up measurement of knowledge retention. We report Sawaal  a voice-based telephone service that uses audio-quizzes to address these challenges. Sawaal allows its open community of users to post and attempt multiple-choice questions and to vote and comment on them. Sawaal spreads virally as users challenge friends to quiz competitions. Administrator-posted questions allow confirming specific knowledge gaps  spreading correct information and measuring knowledge retention via rephrased  repeated questions. In 14 weeks and with no advertisement  Sawaal reached 3 433 users (120 119 calls) in Pakistan  who contributed 13 276 questions that were attempted 455 158 times by 2 027 users. Knowledge retention remained significant for up to two weeks. Surveys revealed that 71% of the mostly low-literate  young  male users were blind.
278,Freedom to Personalize My Digital Classroom: Understanding Teachers' Practices and Motivations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Laton Vermette  Simon Fraser University Joanna McGrenere  University of British Columbia Colin Birge  Microsoft Corporation Adam Kelly  Microsoft Corporation Parmit K. Chilana  Simon Fraser University,Although modern classrooms are increasingly moving towards digital immersion and personalized learning  we have few insights into K-12 teachers' current practices  motivations  and barriers in setting up their digital classroom ecosystems. We interviewed 20 teachers on their process of discovering and integrating a vast range of productivity software and educational platforms in their classrooms  with a particular focus on how they personalize the UI and content of these tools (e.g.  with plugins  templates  or option menus). We found that teachers largely depended on their own experimentation and professional circles to find  personalize  and troubleshoot software tools to support student needs or their own preferences. Teachers were often hesitant to attempt more advanced personalizations due to concerns over student confusion and increased troubleshooting load. We derive several design implications for HCI to better support teachers in sharing their personalized setups and helping their students benefit from digital immersion.
279,Designing Interactive 3D Printed Models with Teachers of the Visually Impaired,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 1,Lei Shi  Cornell University Holly Lawson  Portland State University Zhuohao Zhang  Zhejiang University Shiri Azenkot  Cornell University & Cornell Tech,Students with visual impairments struggle to learn various concepts in the academic curriculum because diagrams  images  and other visual are not accessible to them. To address this  researchers have design interactive 3D printed models (I3Ms) that provide audio descriptions when a user touches components of a model. In prior work  I3Ms were designed on an ad hoc basis  and it is currently unknown what general guidelines produce effective I3M designs. To address this gap  we conducted two studies with Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVIs). First  we led two design workshops with 35 TVIs  who modified sample models and added interactive elements to them. Second  we worked with three TVIs to design three I3Ms in an iterative instructional design process. At the end of this process  the TVIs used the I3Ms we designed to teach their students. We conclude that I3Ms should (1) have effective tactile features (e.g.  distinctive patterns between components)  (2) contain both auditory and visual content (e.g.  explanatory animations)  and (3) consider pedagogical methods (e.g.  overview before details).
280,How Users Interpret Bugs in Trigger-Action Programming,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Will Brackenbury  University of Chicago Abhimanyu Deora  University of Chicago Jillian Ritchey  University of Chicago Jason Vallee  University of Chicago Weijia He  University of Chicago Guan Wang  Brown University Michael L. Littman  Brown University Blase Ur  University of Chicago,Trigger-action programming (TAP) is a programming model enabling users to connect services and devices by writing if-then rules. As such systems are deployed in increasingly complex scenarios  users must be able to identify programming bugs and reason about how to fix them. We first systematize the temporal paradigms through which TAP systems could express rules. We then identify ten classes of TAP programming bugs related to control flow  timing  and inaccurate user expectations. We report on a 153-participant online study where participants were assigned to a temporal paradigm and shown a series of pre-written TAP rules. Half of the rules exhibited bugs from our ten bug classes. For most of the bug classes  we found that the presence of a bug made it harder for participants to correctly predict the behavior of the rule. Our findings suggest directions for better supporting end-user programmers.
281,Evaluating the Effect of Feedback from Different Computer Vision Processing Stages: A Comparative Lab Study,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Jacob Kittley-Davies  University of Southampton Ahmed Alqaraawi  University College London Rayoung Yang  University College London Enrico Costanza  University College London Alex Rogers  University of Oxford Sebastian Stein  University of Southampton,Computer vision and pattern recognition are increasingly being employed by smartphone and tablet applications targeted at lay-users. An open design challenge is to make such systems intelligible without requiring users to become technical experts. This paper reports a lab study examining the role of visual feedback. Our findings indicate that the stage of processing from which feedback is derived plays an important role in users' ability to develop coherent and correct understandings of a system's operation. Participants in our study showed a tendency to misunderstand the meaning being conveyed by the feedback  relating it to processing outcomes and higher level concepts  when in reality the feedback represented low level features. Drawing on the experimental results and the qualitative data collected  we discuss the challenges of designing interactions around pattern matching algorithms.

Bennett  Microsoft Kori Inkpen  Microsoft Jaime Teevan  Microsoft Ruth Kikin-Gil  Microsoft Eric Horvitz  Microsoft,Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades  but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge  highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations  we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies  and to researchers interested in the further development of human-AI interaction design principles.
283,Toward Algorithmic Accountability in Public Services: A Qualitative Study of Affected Community Perspectives on Algorithmic Decision-making in Child Welfare Services,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Dochart 2,Anna Brown  College of Creative Arts  Massey University Alexandra Chouldechova  Carnegie Mellon University & Microsoft Research Emily Putnam-Hornstein  University of Southern California Andrew Tobin  College of Creative Arts  Massey University Rhema Vaithianathan  Auckland University of Technology,Algorithmic decision-making systems are increasingly being adopted by government public service agencies. Researchers  policy experts  and civil rights groups have all voiced concerns that such systems are being deployed without adequate consideration of potential harms  disparate impacts  and public accountability practices. Yet little is known about the concerns of those most likely to be affected by these systems. We report on workshops conducted to learn about the concerns of affected communities in the context of child welfare services. The workshops involved 83 study participants including families involved in the child welfare system  employees of child welfare agencies  and service providers. Our findings indicate that general distrust in the existing system contributes significantly to low comfort in algorithmic decision-making. We identify strategies for improving comfort through greater transparency and improved communication strategies. We discuss the implications of our study for accountable algorithm design for child welfare applications.

285,SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award: A Quantified Past,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Forth,Chris Elsden  Northumbria University,A 'data-driven life' has become an established feature of present and future technological visions. This dissertation interrogates the human experience of a data-driven life  by conceptualising  investigating  and speculating about personal informatics tools as new technologies of memory. I argue that the prevalence of quantified data and metrics is creating fundamentally new and distinct records of everyday life: a 'quantified past'. To address this  I conducted qualitative and idiographic fieldwork -- with long-term self-trackers  and subsequently with users of 'smart journals' -- to investigate how this data-driven record mediates the experience of remembering. Further  I undertook a speculative and design-led inquiry to explore the context of a 'quantified wedding'. Adopting a context where remembering is centrally valued  this Research through Design project demonstrated opportunities for the design of data-driven tools for remembering. Crucially  while speculative  this project maintained a central focus on individual experience  and introduced an innovative methodological approach 'Speculative Enactments' for engaging participants meaningfully in speculative inquiry.
286,SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award: Assignment Problems for Optimizing Text Input,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Forth,Anna Maria Feit  ETH Zurich,Text input methods are an integral part of our daily interaction with digital devices. However  their design poses a complex problem: for any method  we must decide which input action (a button press  a hand gesture  etc.) produces which symbol (e.g.  a character or word). With only 26 symbols and input actions  there are already more than 1026 distinct solutions  making it impossible to find the best one through manual design. Prior work has shown that we can use optimization methods to search such large design spaces efficiently and automatically find a good user interface with respect to the given objectives [6]. However  work in the text entry domain has been limited mostly to the performance optimization of (soft-)keyboards (see [2] for an overview). The Ph.D. thesis [2] advances the field of text-entry optimization by enlarging the space of optimizable text-input methods and proposing new criteria for assessing their optimality. Firstly  the design problem is formulated as an assignment problem for integer programming. This enables the use of standard mathematical solvers and algorithms for efficiently finding good solutions. Then  objective functions are developed  for assessing their optimality with respect to motor performance  ergonomics  and learnability. The corresponding models extend beyond interaction with soft keyboards  to consider multi-finger input  novel sensors  and alternative form factors. In addition  the thesis illustrates how to formulate models from prior work in terms of an assignment problem  providing a coherent theoretical basis for text entry optimization. The proposed objectives are applied in the optimization of three assignment problems: text input with multi-finger gestures in mid-air [8]  text input on a long piano keyboard [4]  and – for a contribution to the official French keyboard standard – input of special characters via a physical keyboard [3]. Combining the proposed models offers a multi-objective optimization approach able to capture the complex cognitive and motor processes during typing. . .
287,SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award: On-World Computing,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Forth,Robert Xiao  University of British Columbia,"Computers are now ubiquitous. However  computers and digital content have remained largely separate from the physical world – users explicitly interact with computers through small screens and input devices  and the ""virtual world"" of digital content has had very little overlap with the practical  physical world. My thesis work is concerned with helping computing escape the confines of screens and devices  spilling digital content out onto the physical world around us. In this way  I aim to help bridge the gap between the information-rich digital world and the familiar environment of the physical world and allow users to interact with digital content as they would ordinary physical content. I approach this problem from many angles: from the low-level work of providing high-fidelity touch interaction on everyday surfaces  easily transforming these surfaces into enormous touchscreens; to high-level questions surrounding the interaction design between physical and virtual realms. To achieve this end  building on my prior work  I developed two physical embodiments of this new mixed-reality design: a tiny  miniaturized projector and camera system providing the hardware basis for a projected on-world interface  and a head-mounted augmented-reality head-mounted display modified to support touch interaction on arbitrary surfaces."
288,The Adventures of Older Authors: Exploring Futures through Co-Design Fictions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Gala,Aloha Hufana Ambe  Queensland University of Technology Margot Brereton  Queensland University of Technology Alessandro Soro  Queensland University of Technology Laurie Buys  Queensland University of Technology Paul Roe  Queensland University of Technology,"This paper presents co-design fiction as an approach to engaging users in imagining  envisioning and speculating not just on future technology but future life through co-created fictional works. Design fiction in research is often created or written by researchers. There is relatively little critical discussion of how to co-create design fictions with end-users  with the concomitant opportunities and challenges this poses. To fill this gap in knowledge  we conducted co-design fiction workshops with nine older creative writers  utilising prompts to inspire discussion and engage their imaginative writing about the trend towards tracking and monitoring older people. Their stories revealed futures of neither dystopia nor utopia but of social and moral dilemmas narrating their wish not just to ""maintain their independence""  but a palpable desire for adventure and very nuanced senses of how they wish to take control. We discuss inherent tensions in the control of the co-design fiction process; balancing the author's need for freedom and creativity with the researcher's desire to guide the process toward the design investigation at hand."
289,HawkEye – Deploying a Design Fiction Probe,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Gala,Renee Noortman  Eindhoven University of Technology Britta F. Schulte  University College London Paul Marshall  University of Bristol Saskia Bakker  Eindhoven University of Technology Anna L. Cox  University College London,This paper explores how a design fiction can be designed to be used as a pragmatic user-centred design method to generate insights on future technology use. We built HawkEye  a design fiction probe that embodies a future fiction of dementia care. To learn how participants respond to the probe  we employed it with eight participants for three weeks in their own homes as well as evaluating it with six HCI experts in sessions of 1.5h. In addition to presenting the probe in detail  we share insights into the process of building it and discuss the utility of design fiction as a tool to elicit empathetic and rich discussions about potential outcomes of future technologies.
290,Smart Home Security Cameras and Shifting Lines of Creepiness: A Design-Led Inquiry,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Gala,James Pierce  California College of the Arts & University of California  Berkeley,Through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras  this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. Digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared  stolen  and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. Hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data  devices  and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them  often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. Foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology  thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. Developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations  this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security  anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use  and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.
291,What is Fair Shipping  Anyway?: Using Design Fiction to Raise Ethical Awareness in an Industrial Context,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Gala,Yiying Wu  Aalto University Sus Lyckvi  Chalmers University of Technology Virpi Roto  Aalto University,The HCI community cares for the human and social aspects of technologies. Ethical discussion on the social implications of new technologies often happen among researchers  but it is important to raise this discussion also in the industry that designs and implements new systems. In this paper  we introduce a case in which design fiction was used as an ethical discussion tool among company partners. We report the process of creating and prototyping a fictional world embedded with conflicting values that aimed to shift the focus from industrial merits towards societal values and raise discussion among participants. Moreover  we examine the challenges and propose suggestions in crafting critiques and friction to the industrial context. Our findings suggest why and how one should use design fiction as a means to raise ethical awareness in a technology- and profit-focused context  to support further activities on developing more humane technological futures.
292,Increasing the Transparency of Research Papers with Explorable Multiverse Analyses,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Pierre Dragicevic  Inria Yvonne Jansen  CNRS – Sorbonne Université Abhraneel Sarma  University of Michigan Matthew Kay  University of Michigan Fanny Chevalier  University of Toronto,We present explorable multiverse analysis reports  a new approach to statistical reporting where readers of research papers can explore alternative analysis options by interacting with the paper itself. This approach draws from two recent ideas: i) multiverse analysis  a philosophy of statistical reporting where paper authors report the outcomes of many different statistical analyses in order to show how fragile or robust their findings are; and ii) explorable explanations  narratives that can be read as normal explanations but where the reader can also become active by dynamically changing some elements of the explanation. Based on five examples and a design space analysis  we show how combining those two ideas can complement existing reporting approaches and constitute a step towards more transparent research papers.
293,Cross-Device Taxonomy: Survey  Opportunities and Challenges of Interactions Spanning Across Multiple Devices,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Frederik Brudy  University College London Christian Holz  Microsoft Research Roman Rädle  Aarhus University Chi-Jui Wu  Lancaster University Steven Houben  Lancaster University Clemens Klokmose  Aarhus University Nicolai Marquardt  University College London,Designing interfaces or applications that move beyond the bounds of a single device screen enables new ways to engage with digital content. Research addressing the opportunities and challenges of interactions with multiple devices in concert is of continued focus in HCI research. To inform the future research agenda of this field  we contribute an analysis and taxonomy of a corpus of 510 papers in the cross-device computing domain. For both new and experienced researchers in the field we provide: an overview  historic trends and unified terminology of cross-device research; discussion of major and under-explored application areas; mapping of enabling technologies; synthesis of key interaction techniques spanning across multiple devices; and review of common evaluation strategies. We close with a discussion of open issues. Our taxonomy aims to create a unified terminology and common understanding for researchers in order to facilitate and stimulate future cross-device research.
294,Anchoring Effects and Troublesome Asymmetric Transfer in Subjective Ratings,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Andy Cockburn  University of Canterbury Carl Gutwin  University of Saskatchewan,Within-subjects experiments are prone to asymmetric transfer  which confounds results interpretation. While HCI researchers routinely test asymmetric transfer in objective data  doing so for subjective data is rare. Yet literature suggests that anchoring effects should make subjective measures particularly susceptible to asymmetric transfer. We report on four analyses of NASA-TLX data from four previously published HCI papers  with four main findings. First  asymmetric transfer is common  occurring in 42% of tests analysed. Second  the data conforms to predictions of anchoring effects. Third  the magnitude of the anchor's effect correlates with the magnitude of the difference between the interface ratings -- that is  the anchor's 'pull' correlates with the anchoring stimulus. Fourth  several of the previously published findings are changed when data are reanalysed using between-subjects treatment. We urge caution when analysing within-subjects subjective measures and recommend that researchers test for and report the occurrence of asymmetric transfer.
295,Touchstone2: An Interactive Environment for Exploring Trade-offs in HCI Experiment Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 1,Alexander Eiselmayer  University of Zurich Chat Wacharamanotham  University of Zurich Michel Beaudouin-Lafon  Université Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay Wendy E. Mackay  Université Paris-Sud  CNRS  Inria  Université Paris-Saclay,Touchstone2 offers a direct-manipulation interface for generating and examining trade-offs in experiment designs. Based on interviews with experienced researchers  we developed an interactive environment for manipulating experiment design parameters  revealing patterns in trial tables  and estimating and comparing statistical power. We also developed TSL  a declarative language that precisely represents experiment designs. In two studies  experienced HCI researchers successfully used Touchstone2 to evaluate design trade-offs and calculate how many participants are required for particular effect sizes. We discuss Touchstone2's benefits and limitations  as well as directions for future research.
296,The Mental Image Revealed by Gaze Tracking,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Xi Wang  Technische Universität Berlin Andreas Ley  Technische Universität Berlin Sebastian Koch  Technische Universität Berlin David Lindlbauer  Technische Universität Berlin & ETH Zurich James Hays  Georgia Institute of Technology Kenneth Holmqvist  Universität Regensburg Marc Alexa  Technische Universität Berlin,Humans involuntarily move their eyes when retrieving an image from memory. This motion is often similar to actually observing the image. We suggest to exploit this behavior as a new modality in human computer interaction  using the motion of the eyes as a descriptor of the image. Interaction requires the user's eyes to be tracked but no voluntary physical activity. We perform a controlled experiment and develop matching techniques using machine learning to investigate if images can be discriminated based on the gaze patterns recorded while users merely think about image. Our results indicate that image retrieval is possible with an accuracy significantly above chance. We also show that this result generalizes to images not used during training of the classifier and extends to uncontrolled settings in a realistic scenario.
297,An Explanation of Fitts' Law-like Performance in Gaze-Based Selection Tasks Using a Psychophysics Approach,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Immo Schuetz  Facebook Reality Labs T. Scott Murdison  Facebook Reality Labs Kevin J. MacKenzie  Facebook Reality Labs Marina Zannoli  Facebook Reality Labs,"Eye gaze as an input method has been studied since the 1990s  to varied results: some studies found gaze to be more efficient than traditional input methods like a mouse  others far behind. Comparisons are often backed up by Fitts' Law without explicitly acknowledging the ballistic nature of saccadic eye movements. Using a vision science-inspired model  we here show that a Fitts'-like distribution of movement times can arise due to the execution of secondary saccades  especially when targets are small. Study participants selected circular targets using gaze. Seven different target sizes and two saccade distances were used. We then determined performance across target sizes for different sampling windows (""dwell times"") and predicted an optimal dwell time range. Best performance was achieved for large targets reachable by a single saccade. Our findings highlight that Fitts' Law  while a suitable approximation in some cases  is an incomplete description of gaze interaction dynamics."

We present CodeGazer  a prototype for source code navigation using eye gaze for common navigation functions. These functions include actions such as ""Go to Definition'' and ""Find All Usages'' of an identifier  navigate to files and methods  move back and forth between visited points in code and scrolling. We present user study results showing that many users liked and even preferred the gaze-based navigation  in particular the ""Go to Definition'' function. Gaze-based navigation is also holding up well in completion time when compared to traditional methods. We discuss how eye gaze can be integrated into traditional mouse & keyboard applications in order to make ""look up'' tasks more natural."
299,ReType: Quick Text Editing with Keyboard and Gaze,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Hall 2,Shyamli Sindhwani  University of Auckland Christof Lutteroth  University of Bath Gerald Weber  University of Auckland,When a user needs to reposition the cursor during text editing  this is often done using the mouse. For experienced typists especially  the switch between keyboard and mouse can slow down the keyboard editing workflow considerably. To address this we propose ReType  a new gaze-assisted positioning technique combining keyboard with gaze input based on a new 'patching' metaphor. ReType allows users to perform some common editing operations while keeping their hands on the keyboard. We present the result of two studies. A free-use study indicated that ReType enhances the user experience of text editing. ReType was liked by many participants  regardless of their typing skills. A comparative user study showed that ReType is able to match or even beat the speed of mouse-based interaction for small text edits. We conclude that the gaze-augmented user interface can make common interactions more fluent  especially for professional keyboard users.
300,Mini Living Lab: Improving Retention and Success for Women in Tech and Diverse Teams Through Redesigning the Critique Process,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Island A CROWNE,Karen Holtzblatt  InContext Enterprises Michael Ahmadi  University of Siegen Anne Weibert  University of Siegen Nicola Marsden  Heilbronn University,Gender disparity in high tech is a long-standing challenge. The number of women in tech is lower than 30 years ago; women leave the field 50% more often than men; attrition costs companies money and talent. This SIG addresses the issue of gender and retention by changing key work practices. As a maker community critique  giving and receiving feedback on one's work  is a necessary and everyday experience. Yet especially women lose self esteem when criticized. Since HCI professionals are key participants in critique it is a good place to start improving interactions within diverse teams. In this SIG we engage the community in a critical examination and reinvention of the critique process. Using a Mini Living Lab format  participants share experiences of their critique practices  brainstorm improvements  and try them out with a practice problem. The organizers share insights from their Living Lab company-research partnerships addressing gender and retention.
301,Online Grocery Delivery Services: An Opportunity to Address Food Disparities in Transportation-scarce Areas,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Lomond,Tawanna R. Dillahunt  University of Michigan Sylvia Simioni  University of Michigan Xuecong Xu  University of Michigan,Online grocery delivery services present new opportunities to address food disparities  especially in underserved areas. However  such services have not been systematically evaluated. This study evaluates such services' potential to provide healthy-food access and influence healthy-food purchases among individuals living in transportation-scarce and low-resource areas. We conducted a pilot experiment with 20 participants consisting of a randomly assigned group's 1-month use of an online grocery delivery service  and a control group's 1-month collection of grocery receipts  and a set of semi-structured interviews. We found that online grocery delivery services (a) serve as a feasible model to healthy-food access if they are affordable and amenable to multiple payment forms and (b) could lead to healthier selections. We contribute policy recommendations to bolster affordability of healthy-food access and design opportunities to promote healthy foods to support the adoption and use of these services among low-resource and transportation-scarce groups.
302,Reading Face  Reading Health: Exploring Face Reading Technologies for Everyday Health,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Lomond,Xianghua Ding  Fudan University Yanqi Jiang  Fudan University Xiankang Qin  Fudan University Yunan Chen  University of California  Irvine Wenqiang Zhang  Fudan University Lizhe Qi  Fudan University,With the recent advancement in computer vision  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  and mobile technologies  it has become technically feasible for computerized Face Reading Technologies (FRTs) to learn about one's health in everyday settings. However  how to design FRT-based applications for everyday health practices remains unexplored. This paper presents a design study with a technology probe called Faced  a mobile health checkup application based on the facial diagnosis method from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). A field trial of Faced with 10 participants suggests potential usage modes and highlights a number of critical design issues in the use of FRTs for everyday health  including adaptability  practicality  sensitivity  and trustworthiness. We end by discussing design implications to address the unique challenges of fully integrating FRTs into everyday health practices.

Many different mobile apps for breaking ""smartphone addiction"" and achieving ""digital wellbeing"" are available. However  it is still not clear whether and how such solutions work. Which functionality do they have? Are they effective and appreciated? Do they have a relevant impact on users' behavior? To answer these questions  (i) we reviewed the features of 42 digital wellbeing apps  (ii) we performed a thematic analysis on 1 128 user reviews of such apps  and (iii) we conducted a 3-week-long in-the-wild study of Socialize  an app that includes the most common digital wellbeing features  with 38 participants. We discovered that digital wellbeing apps are appreciated and useful for some specific situations. However  they do not promote the formation of new habits and they are perceived as not restrictive enough  thus not effectively helping users to change their behavior with smartphones."
304,Beyond Behavior: The Coach's Perspective on Technology in Health Coaching,Monday  May 06  2019 - 16:00:00,Monday  May 06  2019 17:20,Lomond,Heleen Rutjes  Eindhoven University of Technology Martijn C. Willemsen  Eindhoven University of Technology Wijnand A. IJsselsteijn  Technical university of Eindhoven,Rapid innovations in electronic healthcare and behavior tracking systems are challenging health coaches (dietitians  personal trainers  etc.) to rethink their traditional roles and healthcare practices. At the same time  many current e-coaching systems have been developed without explicitly incorporating the healthcare professionals' perspective into the design process. In the current paper  we present three consecutive qualitative studies  starting from the health coach's perspective on successful coaching  progressively zooming in on the potential role and impact of technology as part of the coaching process. Our main finding is that coaches are concerned that introducing technology in the coaching process puts too much emphasis on behavioral information  lowering the attention for the client's lived experience  while understanding those experiences is key for successful coaching. We summarize our insights in a multi-channel communication model and draw implications for the design of supporting technology in health coaching.
305,SRC01: Can Changes in Heart Rate Variability Represented in Sound be Identified by Non-Medical Experts?,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Mariam Bahameish  Queen Mary University of London,Heart rate variability (HRV) has become a wide-spread area for the investigation of the health and stress states of individuals. This paper aims at exploring the effectiveness of representing HRV measures with alternative modalities  other than visual displays  such as audio or haptics. Therefore  we undertook a preliminary study in which we applied a parameter mapping sonification approach to transform the HRV signal into an audible form. In this work  we sought to evaluate the human perception of the developed auditory interface. Hence  a dataset that involves interbeat interval measurements of individuals experiencing changes in mental state in the form of meditation was selected as the basis of the study. The HRV parameters of the dataset were mapped to acoustic features using a linear mapping technique. The feasibility of the system was assessed by measuring the learnability  performance  latency  and confidence aspects. The results suggest a great potential of incorporating auditory displays in the analysis of HRV. Participants were able to distinguish the different meditation states and types with minimal training time. However  further studies should be conducted on a larger population to provide verification of the findings of this preliminary study.
306,SRC02: Muse: Scaffolding Metacognitive Reflection in Design-Based Research,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Victoria Cabales  Northwestern University,While learning science research has explored approaches improving students' problem solving skills by introducing tools that support students in metacognitive reflection  this work has focused on problems with clear solutions  rather than addressing the question of how metacognitive reflection can help students develop their self-regulation skills  which help students understand and control their learning environment through planning  practice  and self-evaluation. This paper presents Muse  an in-action chatbot interface that prompts students to reflect metacognitively on their self-direction process in the midst of working on their independent research projects. Students participate in the Design  Technology  and Research (DTR) program  which provides several undergrads the opportunity to self-direct an independent research project by using the socio-technological model Agile Research Studios (ARS). Results from a case study suggest that Muse helps students identify time consuming habits and set aside less important tasks by giving participants the opportunity to act on their reflections and adjust aspects of their process that they deem less effective.
307,SRC03: Guidelines for Combining Storytelling and Gamification: Which Features Would Teenagers Desire to Have a More Enjoyable Museum Experience?,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Vanessa Cesário  University of Porto & Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute,While museums are often designed to engage and interest a wide variety of audiences  teenagers are a neglected segment. This PhD research in Digital Media explores how digital technologies can facilitate natural history museums in creating immersive museum experiences for teenagers (15–18 years old)  especially through digital storytelling and gamification frameworks. This contribution would be a set of guidelines that will aid in designing interactive experiences inside these museums. So far  we have involved a total of 155 teens through co-design sessions  130 in focus groups  and 98 in usability studies  as well as 3 museums  12 curators  and 17 master students. Through qualitative analysis  our preliminary findings suggest that teenagers value gamification and storytelling elements when thinking about enjoyable museum tours  while curators value story-based narratives as the most prominent method to provide enjoyable museum experience for teens. Based on the findings identified  and in collaboration with the Madeira-ITI  two interactive mobile experiences targeted at teenagers were developed for the Natural History Museum of Funchal  Portugal.
308,SRC04: Understanding the Occupational Therapists Method to Inform the Design of Technologies for People with Dementia,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Emma Dixon  University of Maryland  College Park,This paper describes a PhD research project involving people with dementia and practitioners who work primarily with people with dementia to support engagement in meaningful activities and activities of everyday living. The aim of this work is to develop a technology which adapts to changing cognitive demands of people with dementia in order to facilitate continuous engagement in meaningful activities. In depth  semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners to understand their methods for personalization of activities and the implications for design of future adaptive technologies. Preliminary results from interviews with Occupational Therapists are presented.
309,SRC05: Lake: A Digital Wizard of Oz Prototyping Tool,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Andrew Finke  Northwestern University,Mobile app designers aim to develop the best mobile software interfaces in the least amount of time  and rely on testing ideas with prototypes in lieu of building costly  fully functioning applications. Yet  designers cannot effectively prototype some complex app experiences  including augmented reality applications like Pokémon GO  because existing tools lack the needed features  or because prototyping in them is too time intensive to be feasible. To solve this problem  we introduce Lake  a mobile application prototyping tool that enables the creation of complex mobile applications with the same ease as paper prototyping. By leveraging the Wizard of Oz technique used in paper prototyping in our digital medium  we enable designers to prototype at the same low cost as paper  but at a much higher fidelity. Through a pilot study (N=6)  we find that designers are able to gather organic in-context feedback from complex prototypes made with Lake.
310,SRC06: Automatic Speech Recognition Services: Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Usability,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Abraham Glasser  Rochester Institute of Technology,Nowadays  speech is becoming a more common  if not standard  interface to technology. This can be seen in the trend of technology changes over the years. Increasingly  voice is used to control programs  appliances and personal devices within homes  cars  workplaces  and public spaces through smartphones and home assistant devices using Amazon's Alexa  Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri  and other proliferating technologies. However  most speech interfaces are not accessible for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) people. In this paper  performances of current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with voices of DHH speakers are evaluated. ASR has improved over the years  and is able to reach Word Error Rates (WER) as low as 5-6% [1][2][3]  with the help of cloud-computing and machine learning algorithms that take in custom vocabulary models. In this paper  a custom vocabulary model is used  and the significance of the improvement is evaluated when using DHH speech.
311,SRC07: Affordable Smart Wheelchair,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Isabella Gomez Torres  University of California  San Diego Gaurav Parmar  University of California  San Diego Sammarth Aggarwal  University of California  San Diego Nathaniel Mansur  University of California  San Diego Alec Guthrie  University California  San Diego,Power wheelchairs (PW) are an example of an assistive technology in that they are used to increase  maintain  or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities [6]. As seen in [5] [3]  the commercially available products do not provide any assistance beyond enhanced mobility. Furthermore  existing PW research fails at comprehensively noting an individual's challenges  such as navigating through narrow passages or fixing their broken wheelchairs. Instead  they focus mostly on novel interaction methods such as BCI  head and gaze control [9] [15]. In this paper  we explore these individual needs and show that PWs have the novel potential to become a smart wheelchair at an affordable price. Our research follows the double diamond (DD) process [2] and relies on the participatory design (PD) methodology [7]  which addresses all stakeholders involved. Namely  we consider individuals with wheelchairs  the assistive technology research community  and the PW industry. For further insight we also contacted medical doctors  healthcare professionals  and non- profit organizations. We spent time getting to know these communities through interviews  surveys  demonstrations  and continuous user inputs  aligning our work to the PD tools. We found that individuals using wheelchairs overall desire safety  accessibility  and a durable design. Guided by these results  we designed a proof of concept (POC) system called the Affordable Smart Wheelchair (ASW) for indoor use. This kit implements full-autonomy in the form of indoor navigation from one room to another and to predetermined docking locations through voice control. It also has semi-autonomous functions in the form of manual joystick control augmented with real-time collision avoidance and staircase detection.
312,SRC08: Math Graphs for the Visually Impaired: Audio Presentation of Elements of Mathematical Graphs,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jeongyeon Kim  Sogang University Yoonah Lee  Sogang University Inho Seo  Sogang University,The sense of sight takes a dominating role in learning mathematical graphs. Most visually impaired students drop out of mathematics because necessary content is inaccessible. Sonification and auditory graphs have been the primary methods of representing data through sound. However  the representation of mathematical elements of graphs is still unexplored. The experiments in this paper investigate optimal methods for representing mathematical elements of graphs with sound. The results indicate that the methods of design in this study are effective for describing mathematical elements of graphs  such as axes  quadrants and differentiability. These findings can help visually impaired learners to be more independent  and also facilitate further studies on assistive technology.
313,SRC09: I Am What You Eat: Effects of Social Influence on Meal Selection Online,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Maria D. Molina  Pennsylvania State University,The availability of mHealth technologies has increased exponentially  particularly fitness and calorie tracking applications. Recent studies and anecdotal evidence has highlighted the potential of these technologies to serve as tools of bad eating behavior due to its focus on self-monitoring and calorie counting. The current research investigates on the potential of using social-orienting features of technology  specifically bandwagon and identity cues  to incentivize food-based nutrition (FBN) rather than a calorie-only approach. For this purpose  a 2 x 2 mixed factorial online experiment was conducted with bandwagon cue as a within-subject factor and identity cue as a between-subject factor. Results reveal that 67.6% of participants selected high bandwagon cue meals  regardless of its nutritional value. Bandwagon perception was the only significant predictor of meal selection  indicating that an increase in one unit improved the odds of an individual choosing a high bandwagon meal by 69%.
314,SRC10: Designing Compassion Cultivating Interactions for New Mothers,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Annu Sible Prabhakar  University of Cincinnati & Indiana University,This paper describes a research project that aims to examine an unexplored design space-compassion cultivation for wellness. This project seeks to understand the components of compassionate interactions between new mothers and their proximate and primary supporters-partners -- to inform the design of compassion cultivating interventions for maternal wellness. A discussion of research activities undertaken thus far and preliminary results are presented.
315,SRC11: Family-Centered Exploration of the Benefits and Burdens of Digital Home Assistants,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Olivia K. Richards  Pennsylvania State University,Parents receive conflicting information on the benefits and burdens of children's technology use  especially novel technologies such as digital home assistants. To understand parents' views  we analyzed relevant Amazon Echo device product reviews posted to Amazon.com  and deployed a User Benefit and Burden Survey to 131 parents on Amazon Mechanical Turk to explore their perspectives of Amazon Echo digital home assistants. Our work explores parents' perceptions of the devices with regards to their children and families  in terms of attributes such as benefits and burdens. This study contributes an empirical  family-centered understanding of and design opportunities for whole home personal assistants in support of a diversity of families.
316,SRC12: Privacy Therapy with Aretha: What If Your Firewall Could Talk?,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,William Seymour  University of Oxford,The rapid adoption of smart home devices has brought with it a widespread lack of understanding amongst users over where their devices send data. Smart home ecosystems represent complex additions to existing wicked problems around network privacy and security in the home. This work presents the Aretha project  a device which combines the functionality of a firewall with the position of voice assistants as the hub of the smart home  and the sophistication of modern conversational voice interfaces. The result is a device which can engage users in conversation about network privacy and security  allowing for the forming and development of complex preferences that Aretha is then able to act upon.
317,SRC13: ParaXplore: Demystifying the Exploration of Large Design Spaces,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Naghmi Shireen  Simon Fraser University,Generative design tools together with large screen displays provide designers an opportunity to explore large numbers of design alternatives. There are numerous design studies on exploring multiple simultaneous designs  but few present interface solutions and system features for such exploration. To the best of my knowledge  no study probes exploring a large design space with multiple simultaneous states. The premise of my research is that  if designers can work directly with large numbers of designs with new representations and tools as part of the design workflow  we should expect new patterns and strategies to emerge and change the design process. Such task environments may present novel actions  task sequences  methods and techniques. What are new actions and techniques that would enable working seamlessly with multiple designs? My research aims to answer this (and similar) questions; and  more specifically  to uncover how designers' augment their work through spatial structuring of the task environment to reduce the cognitive cost of working with multiple simultaneous designs on a large work-surface. I conducted a lab experiment with nine designers. The results suggest design features for new front-end gallery interfaces for managing a large set of design variations while enabling simultaneous editing.
318,SRC14: Sense of Familiarity: Improving Older Adults' Adaptation to Exergames,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Hao Zhang  Nanyang Technological University,Exergames are proven to be effective in helping older adults improve their physical and mental capabilities. However  older adults' maladaptation to exergames may occur due to the complexity of game tasks and interfaces. In this work  we show that familiarity can improve older adults' adaptation to exergames. The results of our first study indicate that older adults with higher level of familiarity to exergames exhibit higher level of motivation and ability. To maximize the effectiveness of exergames  it is helpful to provide older adults exergames which they are more familiar with. To evaluate the familiarity level of exergames  we propose a novel familiarity model with five factors  namely prior experience  positive emotion  repeated time  level of processing  and retention rate. Results from our second study show that the identified five factors have significant positive correlations with familiarity and there is a high positive correlation between familiarity levels and participants' satisfaction to the exergames.
319,SRC15: GPK: An Efficient Special Symbol Input Method for Keyboards,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Xiyuan He  Zhejiang University Zhuohao Zhang  Zhejiang University,We introduce a novel typing technique for special symbols in the keyboard-only environment. The technique  called GPK (Gliding on Physical Keyboard)  consists of two steps for entering special symbols. First  a user draws the special symbol on the keyboard by gliding over keys; Second  the user can select the desired symbol from the predicted symbols generated by GPK. Users can also switch from this mode to normal typing mode. We also present an application of this input technique based on web browsers. A user study with nine participants who are familiar with keyboard input showed the input efficiency of GPK. We compared the typing efficiency of GPK with other special symbol typing methods. We could deploy this method to office environments where users have desktop computers with a keyboard only. It could also inspire future work of integrating this method into word processors  document preparation systems and web environments.
320,DC01: Designing for the Self: Enabling People to Design Behavioral Interventions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Elena Agapie  University of Washington,I investigate how individuals can employ human centered design techniques to adopt positive behaviors in their everyday life. I have designed and built a tool that supports individuals in planning physical activity using design processes such as understanding other people's behavioral needs  ideating behavioral interventions and prototyping behavioral solutions using evidence-based techniques. In my dissertation I will demonstrate how tools can support iterative behavioral design by evaluating behavioral solutions  drawing insights from testing  and making iterations to a behavioral solution. This work will result in new tools and design methods that enable people to adapt evidence-based techniques in a way that fits with their everyday needs.
321,DC02: Bridging Social Critique and Design: Building a Health Informatics Tool for Transgender Voice,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Alex A. Ahmed  Northeastern University,This project aims to develop a voice training application for transgender people. Voice training is typically conducted by a speech therapist  and consists of personalized sessions that support individuals in changing their voices (such as modifying pitch  resonance  or speech patterns). The reasons why people may pursue voice training are varied  but often includes discomfort with voice being misaligned with gender identity. Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus  a technological solution  as I propose in my research  is necessary. This project will address existing constraints to design a novel voice training application in partnership with community members  using a participatory research methodology and combining the fields of speech science  feminist and queer theory  and HCI.
322,DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
323,DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,"Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of ""futuring"" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities."
324,DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
325,DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
326,DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
327,DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.
328,DC09: Player Types of Gamers: Critical Evaluation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Suvi K. Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
329,DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
330,DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
331,DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
332,DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
333,DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
334,DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
335,DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
336,DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
337,DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
338,DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.

It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.

342,DC03: Bodily Connectedness: Designing Affective  Movement-based Communication Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Yulia Brazauskayte  University of New South Wales,This is a practice based PhD research that explores inter-affective movement-based communication as an approach to mediated connectedness (an immediate  felt experience of feeling close to another person) over distance in dyads. Inspired by recent socio-cognitive theories (e.g. enactive intersubjectivity [8]  synergistic approach [16]  in this thesis communication is viewed as a dynamic coordination between two holistic living bodies  rather than two abstract minds transmitting information from sender to receiver. The main hypothesis is that coordinated inter-affective movement can facilitate the feeling of connectedness in mediated settings. I will creatively explore this assumption by developing a sequence of experimental design artifacts.
343,DC04: HCI for Participatory Futuring in Sustainable Communities: Reconciling Visions with Everyday Practice,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Simran Chopra  Northumbria University,"Current food consumption patterns are unsustainable. The food system is globalized and dominated by a few large organisations  which dis-empowers people to make changes to it. However  grassroots communities are important in engendering positive change from the bottom up. Long-term thinking is a key to empowering these communities in transitioning towards sustainable food systems. This research is concerned with practices of ""futuring"" in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness  participation  and coordination in constructing visions of the future  and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities."
344,DC05: Reconnecting the Body and the Mind: Technology to Support Mindfulness for Stress,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Karen Anne Cochrane  University of Sydney,Mindfulness meditation has the potential to help practitioners cope with their stress. Currently  projects often use corrective feedback models to help people understand when they are out of a mindfulness state. My dissertation uses research by design to build a technology intervention for mindfulness meditation that adopts a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a natural soundscape that responds to the user's brainwave activity collected from the Muse EEG Headset.
345,DC06: User Adaptation to Constant Change in Algorithmically-Driven Social Platforms,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Michael A. DeVito  Northwestern University,Social platforms present a challenge for self-presentation and identity management by obscuring audiences behind algorithmic mechanisms. Users are increasingly aware of this and actively adapting through folk theorization  but we do not know how users are coping with the constant change endemic to these platforms  or how we can assist users in this coping process. My dissertation will examine how users perceive and adapt to the constantly-changing platform space using self-presentation and audience management as an illustrative case.
346,DC07: Algorithms  Oppression  and Mental Illness on Social Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jessica L. Feuston  Northwestern University,My research explores how individuals with mental illness express themselves online and off. Through digital ethnography  including interviews with Instagram users and manual collection of public content on Instagram  I have holistically examined the experience of mental illness as expressed through social media. This user-centric approach reveals and addresses the limitations of computational techniques  which my dissertation work will address by combining qualitative methods with generative algorithms to explore new 'ways of seeing' mental illness. I will create new tools enabling users to generate representations from their own posts in support of creating new representations of mental illness  advancing algorithmic fairness  and confronting technological forms of oppression online.
347,DC08: Languages & Visualizations to Enable Effective End User Programming,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jane Hoffswell  University of Washington,Programming requires expertise to employ effectively. My research aims to help end user programmers more effectively author  understand  and reuse code and data through the design of new languages and program visualization tools. New programming languages can raise the level of abstraction to focus on relevant domain-specific details. Improved tools can better align with and enrich end user programmers' mental models. Visualizing program state and behavior promotes program understanding  and can proactively surface surprising or incorrect results. My future work proposes to explore new visualization techniques and languages to facilitate understanding of constraint programming systems.
348,DC09: Player Types of Gamers: Critical Evaluation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Suvi K. Holm  University of Turku,The following extended abstract describes a research plan for and preliminary findings of a dissertation thesis on player types. The described four studies aim to answer to questions of what player types are  how it is possible to improve such categorizations  and whether player typologies based on self-reports can be validated by emotional responses during playing.
349,DC10: Designing Visual Communication of Everyday Illness Experiences in Pediatric Care,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Matthew K. Hong  Georgia Institute of Technology,In complex chronic care  patients' ongoing awareness of their health status and ability to articulate health needs are vital to active participation in care  yet they face various challenges that could thwart their potential to engage in such participation. My research explores how design methods in HCI can evolve to meet these challenges by engaging both adolescents and family caregivers throughout the process of tracking the patients' illness experiences and co-designing rich representations that are expected to support adolescents' communication of these experiences in care. This thesis will contribute 1) a critical understanding of the ways in which human-centered design can address primary challenges that adolescents face when engaging in care  2) a novel method for conducting co-design research with chronically ill patient families  and a 3) family-centered mobile health technology that demonstrates the feasibility of engaging pediatric patient families.
350,DC11: Designing for Visual Data Exploration in Multi-Device Environments,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tom Horak  Technische Universität Dresden,Multi-device environments have an enormous potential to enable more flexible workflows during our daily work. At the same time  visual data exploration is characterized as a fragmented sensemaking process requiring a high degree of flexibility. In my thesis  I am aiming to bring these two worlds into symbiosis  specifically for sensemaking with multivariate data visualizations and graph visualizations. This involves three main objectives: (i) understanding the devices' roles in dynamic device ensembles and their relations to exploration patterns  (ii) identifying mechanisms for adapting visualizations for different devices while preserving a consistent perception and interaction  and  finally  (iii) supporting users and developers in designing such distributed visualization interfaces  e.g.  through specific guidelines. As specific contributions  it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space  while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far  I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.
351,DC12: Expressive Biosignals: Authentic Social Cues for Social Connection,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Fannie Liu  Carnegie Mellon University,My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression  while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research  I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts  including interpersonal relationships and mental health.
352,DC13: Inventive Scaffolds Catalyze Creative Learning,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tricia J. Ngoon  University of California  San Diego,Creative problem-solving requires both exploratory and evaluative thinking skills. The contextual  open-ended nature of creative tasks makes them uniquely challenging to teach and learn. People tend to under-explore in problem-solving  using the most available representation of a problem and hindering potentially more creative solutions. My dissertation examines how inventive scaffolds provide feedback between the exploration and evaluation processes of creative problem-solving  potentially amplifying creativity of solutions. I investigate this through two interventions. First  interactive guidance and adaptive suggestions embodied in the CritiqueKit system to improve critique and evaluation of creative work. Second  problem-framing scaffolds to reduce fixation and enhance exploration. My research demonstrates methods for increasing human inventiveness with relevance in creative education and the design of creativity support interfaces.
353,DC14: Mobile Persuasive Technology: Promoting Positive Waste Management Behaviors in Developing African Nations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Makuochi Nkwo  Ebonyi State University,My research examines new ways of persuading citizens to change their behavior towards waste management  and protect the environment. As a first step towards contributing to research  I conducted a user-based study  to find what strategies could be used to motivate national citizens to adopt positive waste disposal behaviors. Mapping the results to their matching persuasive technology techniques and operationalizing them in a mobile web platform  I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to promote positive and environmentally responsible behaviors and protect the environment from pollution.
354,DC15: Technology Meets Fashion: Exploring Wearables  Fashion Tech and Haute Tech Couture,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Teddy Seyed  University of Calgary,The introduction of technology into the worlds of fashion and haute couture  has made it possible for fashion designers and technologists to create and experiment with garments and wearables in a variety of novel and expressive forms. Several of these haute couture garments infused with technology are shown on international runways and can ultimately influence the design of consumer fashion and wearable products. Within this context  I describe my dissertation which aims to explore and understand the role of technology throughout the process of design and fabrication in the haute tech couture domain and uncover broader implications for the design of wearables.
355,DC16: Collaborative Video Game Design Work and Diversity,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Rachel N. Simons  The University of Texas at Austin,This overview describes my ongoing dissertation research on diversity within collaborative video game design. First  I explain why research into daily work within this field is needed  especially with a focus on diversity. Next  I briefly review previous research and identify three key areas for considering diversity in the field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups  the structure of organizations  and collaborative work tool selection and use. I then outline my qualitative research approach of conducting semi-structured interviews with video game designers. Finally  I present some preliminary results and expected contributions for this research.
356,DC17: Exploring Future IoT for Families through End User Development: Applying Do-It-Together Practises to Reveal Family Dynamics in Technology Adoption,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,David Verweij  Northumbria University,Industry and research increasingly explore opportunities to make our homes smart  e.g. through the Internet of Things (IoT). Technological developments nurture this rise of smart products  seemingly corresponding to households' needs. Yet  these domestic environments remain a complex domain to study or design for. This work explores the understudied complexity of families' needs and values in relation to connected and smart technology  in particular as a multi-user group. By leveraging participatory and do-it-yourself practices  I aim to engage families in discussion - and empower them to externalize and reflect upon their views. As such  I can study their reflective practices to reveal (tacit) understandings and (latent) needs which informs future developments in smart home technologies.
357,DC18: Designing for Long-term Digital Data Management,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Francesco Vitale  University of British Columbia,Digital data is a pervasive component of modern society  with people managing a growing number of data types across many devices. My research explores people's choices on what to keep over the long-term and aims to design personalized data management tools. In a first study  I characterized individual differences in data preservation behaviors. I plan to use interviews  a survey  and probing methods to further extend this characterization and define a design space for long-term data management. Then  I plan to build and evaluate a prototype that synthesizes findings from all my studies.
358,DC19: Exploring Socially-Focused Technologies that Can Help Children with Cancer Feel More Like Children Despite their Disease  Treatment and Environment,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jillian L. Warren  Simon Fraser University,This describes the background and motivation for dedicating my PhD to the exploration of socially-focused technologies for childhood cancer patients. Very little work has been done  especially in the field of human and child computer interaction  to explore the ways in which the hospital context in conjunction with the cancer experience impact children's social and emotional well-being during middle childhood (ages 6-12)  and in turn how technology could improve their experience. My research seeks to (1) empower children with cancer by providing a platform for them to voice their own experiences with isolation  loneliness  and loss of a normal childhood  as well as how technology may better support their needs  (2) contribute design knowledge about how to support meaningful social interaction and play that is age and 'ability' appropriate  and (3) provide insight for future design and evaluation studies by better understanding constraints/opportunities for socially-focused technologies intended for use in a real world pediatric hospital environment.
359,DC20: Co-Designing Digital Technologies to Support Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Cara Wilson  Queensland University of Technology,This doctoral work considers how to best co-design with minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum in classroom contexts. It focuses on 1) leveraging personal interests and individual strengths to foster engagement  social interaction and self-expression through novel technologies and 2) child-centred  holistic methodological approaches to co-design work. This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.
360,INT001: ScaleDial: A Novel Tangible Device for Teaching Musical Scales & Triads,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Konstantin Klamka  Technische Universität Dresden Jannik Wojnar  Technische Universität Dresden Raimund Dachselt  Technische Universität Dresden,The teaching of harmonic foundations in music is a common learning objective in many education systems. However  music theory is often considered as a non-interactive subject matter that requires huge efforts to understand. With this work  we contribute a novel tangible device  called ScaleDial  that makes use of the relations between geometry and music theory to provide interactive  graspable and playful learning experiences. Therefore  we introduce an innovative tangible cylinder and demonstrate how harmonic relationships can be explored through a physical set of digital manipulatives  that can be arranged and stacked on top of an interactive chromatic circle. Based on the tangible interaction and further rich visual and auditory output capabilities  ScaleDial enables a better understanding of scales  pitch constellations  triads  as well as intervals. Further  we describe the technical realization of our advanced prototype and show how we fabricate the magnetic  capacitive and mechanical sensing.
361,INT002: ClassBeacons: Enhancing Reflection-in-Action of Teachers through Spatially Distributed Ambient Information,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Pengcheng An  Eindhoven University of Technology Saskia Bakker  Eindhoven University of Technology Sara Ordanovski  Utrecht University Ruurd Taconis  Eindhoven University of Technology Chris L. E. Paffen  Utrecht University Berry Eggen  Eindhoven University of Technology,Reflection-in-action (RiA) refers to teachers' reflections on their teaching performance during busy classroom routines. RiA is a demanding competence for teachers  but little has been known about how HCI systems could support teachers' RiA during their busy and intensive teaching. To bridge this gap  we design and evaluate an ambient information system named ClassBeacons. ClassBeacons aims to help teachers intuitively reflect-in-action on how to divide time and attention over pupils throughout a lesson. ClassBeacons subtly depicts teachers' division of time and attention over pupils through multiple light-objects distributed over students' desks. Each light-object indicates how long the teacher has been cumulatively around it (helping an adjacent student) by shifting color. A field evaluation with eleven teachers proved that ClassBeacons enhanced teachers' RiA by supporting their sensemaking of ongoing performance and modification of upcoming actions. Furthermore  ClassBeacons was experienced to unobtrusively fit into teachers' routines without overburdening teaching in progress.
362,INT003: Physical Programming for Blind and Low Vision Children at Scale,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Nicolas Villar  Microsoft Research Cecily Morrison  Microsoft Research Daniel Cletheroe  Microsoft Research Tim Regan  Microsoft Research Anja Thieme  Microsoft Research Greg Saul  Microsoft Research,There is a dearth of appropriate tools for young learners with mixed visual abilities to engage with computational learning. Addressing this gap  we present Project Torino  a physical programming language for teaching computational learning to children ages 7-11 regardless of level of vision. To create code  children connect and manipulate tactile objects to create music  audio stories  or poetry. Designed to be made and deployed at scale  Project Torino (along with a scheme of work) has been successfully used by 30 non-specialist teachers with 75 children across the UK over three months.
363,INT004: StringTouch: A Scalable Low-Cost Concept for Deformable Interfaces,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Beat Rossmy  LMU University of Munich Alexander Wiethoff  LMU University of Munich,This paper describes a demo prototype of a tangible user interface (TUI) concept that is derived from the expressive play of musical string instruments. We translated this interaction paradigm to an interactive demo which offers a novel gesture vocabulary (strumming  picking  etc.). In this work we present our interaction concepts  prototype description  technical details and insights on the rapid and low-cost manufacturing and design process.

364,INT005: Tangible Interactions with Acoustic Levitation,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Asier Marzo  Universidad Publica de Navarra Steven Kockaya  University of Bristol Euan Freeman  University of Glasgow Julie Williamson  University of Glasgow,Acoustic Levitation can hold millimetric objects in mid-air without any physical contact. This capability has been exploited to create displays since being able to position mid-air physical voxels enables for rich data representations. However  most of the times interesting features of acoustic levitation are not exploited. Acoustic Levitation is harmless and sound diffracts around objects  thus we can insert our hand inside the levitator and touch the levitated particles without harmful effect on us. In this demo  we showcase more tangible interactions with acoustically levitated particles by passing acoustically-transparent structures through the particles  manipulating particles in mid-air with wearable levitators or by moving multiple particles with direct manipulation. We hope that this demo provides a more tangible experience of acoustic levitation. Since all the presented devices are Do-It-Yourself  we encourage visitors to experiment further with acoustic levitation.
365,INT006: Three-in-one: Levitation  Parametric Audio  and Mid-Air Haptic Feedback,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Gözel Shakeri  University of Glasgow Euan Freeman  University of Glasgow William Frier  University of Sussex Michele Iodice  Ultrahaptics Benjamin Long  Ultrahaptics Ltd Orestis Georgiou  Ultrahaptics Ltd Carl Andersson  Applied Acoustics,Ultrasound enables new types of human-computer interfaces  ranging from auditory and haptic displays to levitation (visual). We demonstrate these capabilities with an ultrasonic phased array that allows users to interactively manipulate levitating objects with mid-air hand gestures whilst also receiving auditory feedback via highly directional parametric audio  and haptic feedback via focused ultrasound onto their bare hands. Therefore  this demo presents the first ever ultrasound rig which conveys information to three different sensory channels and levitates small objects simultaneously.
366,INT007: Demonstration of Refinity: An Interactive Holographic Signage for New Retail Shopping Experience,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jin Ryong Kim  Alibaba Group Stephanie Chan  Alibaba Group Xiangchao Huang  Alibaba Group Kenneth Ng  Alibaba Group Limin Paul Fu  Alibaba Group Chen Zhao  Alibaba Group,This demo presents Refinity - an interactive holographic signage for the new retail shopping experience. In our demo  we show a concept of futuristic shopping experience with a tangible 3D mid-air interface that allows customers to directly select and explore realistic virtual products using autostereoscopic 3D display combined with mid-air haptics and finger tracker. We also present an example of in-store shopping scenario for natural interactions with 3D. This shopping experience will engage users in producing a memorable in-store experience with the merging of digital and physical interactions.
367,INT008: Multimodal Representation of Complex Spatial Data,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Hrishikesh Rao  University of Michigan Sile O'Modhrain  University of Michigan,For blind users  spatial information is often presented in non-spatial form such as electronic speech.We explore the possibility of representing spatial data on refreshable tactile graphic displays in combination with audio feedback and utilizing both static and dynamic tactile information. We demonstrate an implementation of a New York Times style crossword puzzle  providing interactions to query location and stored data  ask for clues in across and down directions  edit and fill in the crossword puzzle using a Perkins style braille keyboard or a typewriter-style keyboard   and verify answers. Through our demonstration  we explore tradeoffs related to available tactile real estate  and overcrowding of the tactile image with a view toward reducing the cognitive workload involved in retaining a working mental model of the active grid  and the time to complete a letter placement task.

Depping  University of Saskatchewan Regan Mandryk  University of Saskatchewan James Collin Fey  University of California  Santa Cruz Katherine Isbister  University of California  Santa Cruz,Social closeness is important for an individual's health and well-being  and this is especially difficult to maintain over a distance. Games can help with this  to connect and strengthen relationships or create new ones by enabling shared playful experiences. The demo proposed is a game we designed called 'In the Same Boat'  a two-player game intended to foster social closeness between players over a distance. We leverage the synchronization of both players' physiological data (heart rate  breathing facial expressions) mapped to an input scheme to control the movement of a canoe down a river.
371,INT012: Slackliner 2.0: Real-time Training Assistance through Life-size Feedback,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Christian Murlowski  DFKI  Saarland Informatics Campus Florian Daiber  DFKI  Saarland Informatics Campus Felix Kosmalla  DFKI  Saarland Informatics Campus Antonio Krüger  DFKI  Saarland Informatics Campus,In this demo  we present Slackliner 2.0  an interactive slackline training assistant which features head and skeleton tracking  and real-time feedback through life-size projection. Like in other sports  proper training leads to a faster increase of skill and lessens the risk of injuries. We chose a set of exercises from slackline literature and implemented an interactive trainer which guides the user through the exercises giving feedback if the exercises were executed correctly. Based on lessons learned from our study and prior demonstrations we present a revised version of Slackliner that uses head tracking to better guide the user's attention and movements. Additionally a new visual indicator informs the trainee about her arm posture during the performance. This has been also included in an updated post-analysis view that provides the trainee with more detailed feedback about her performance. The present demo showcases an interactive sports training system that provides in-situ feedback while following a well-guided learning procedure.

Love  Abertay University Mona Bozdog  Abertay University,Ola De La Vida is a three-player cooperative game installation which is designed to harness the qualities of social play environment such as an arcade or play party (an event which mixes games  music  dance and socializing). Ola De La Vida uses physical and digital design techniques that consider the unique qualities of a social play space being sensitive to the complex personal  social and interpersonal aspects each player may experience. The game installation uses its scale to heighten the visibility of the game in a crowded play space  custom control methods to lower barriers to entry and costume to promote teamwork  collaboration and to lower social anxieties. These techniques  in partnership with the digital-physical nature of the game play aims to entice players and spectators in a social environment to participate. Through this installation we hope to encourage discussion around designing for participation and the challenges of social play.

Cormier  University of Waterloo Christian Hansen  Otto-von-Guericke Universität Edward Lank  University of Waterloo Lennart E. Nacke  University of Waterloo,We introduceCrushed It!  an interactive game on a sensor floor. This floor is combined with a multiple projector system to reduce occlusions from players' interactions with the floor. Individual displays  an HTC Vive to track player position  and smart watches were added to provide an extra layer of interactivity. We created this interactive experience to explore collaboration between people when interacting with large displays. We contribute a novel combination of different technologies for this game system and our studies showed this game is both entertaining and provides players with motivation to stay physically active. We believe presenting at interactivity would be a benefit to both our research and to the attendees of CHI 2019.
374,INT015: FoldTronics Demo: Creating 3D Objects with Integrated Electronics Using Foldable Honeycomb Structures,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Junichi Yamaoka  Massachusetts Institute of Technology & University of Tokyo Mustafa Doga Dogan  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Katarina Bulovic  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Kazuya Saito  University of Tokyo Yoshihiro Kawahara  University of Tokyo Yasuaki Kakehi  University of Tokyo Stefanie Mueller  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,We present FoldTronics  a 2D-cutting based fabrication technique to integrate electronics into 3D folded objects. The key idea is to cut and perforate a 2D sheet using a cutting plotter to make it foldable into a 3D honeycomb structure; before folding  users place the electronic components and circuitry onto the sheet. The fabrication process only takes a few minutes allowing to rapidly prototype functional interactive devices. The resulting objects are lightweight and rigid  thus allowing for weight-sensitive and force-sensitive applications. Due to the nature of honeycombs  the created objects can be folded flat along one axis and thus can be efficiently transported in this compact form factor.
375,INT016: Demonstrating Kyub: A 3D Editor for Modeling Sturdy Laser-Cut Objects,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Patrick Baudisch  Hasso Plattner Institute Arthur Silber  Hasso Plattner Institute Yannis Kommana  Hasso Plattner Institute Milan Gruner  Hasso Plattner Institute Ludwig Wall  Hasso Plattner Institute Kevin Reuss  Hasso Plattner Institute Lukas Heilmann  Hasso-Plattner-Institut Robert Kovacs  Hasso Plattner Institute Daniel Rechlitz  Hasso Plattner Institute Thijs Roumen  Hasso Plattner Institute,"We present an interactive editing system for laser cutting called kyub. Kyub allows users to create models efficiently in 3D  which it then unfolds into the 2D plates laser cutters expect. Unlike earlier systems  such as FlatFitFab  kyub affords construction based on closed box structures  which allows users to turn very thin material  such as 4mm plywood  into objects capable of withstanding large forces  such as chairs users can actually sit on. To afford such sturdy construction  every kyub project begins with a simple finger-joint ""boxel""—a structure we found to be capable of withstanding over 500kg of load. Users then extend their model by attaching additional boxels. Boxels merge automatically  resulting in larger  yet equally strong structures. While the concept of stacking boxels allows kyub to offer the strong affordance and ease of use of a voxel-based editor  boxels are not confined to a grid and readily combine with kuyb's various geometry deformation tools. In our technical evaluation  objects built with kyub withstood hundreds of kilograms of loads. We demonstrate the kyub software to the CHI audience and allow them to experience the resulting models first hand."

Much of this research focuses on elastomers or non-stretchy air bladders. In this work  we explore a series of design strategies for machine knitting actuated soft objects by integrating tendons with shaping and anisotropic texture design.
377,INT018: Painting with CATS: Camera-Aided Texture Synthesis,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Ticha Sethapakdi  Carnegie Mellon University James McCann  Carnegie Mellon University,We present CATS  a digital painting system that synthesizes textures from live video in real-time  short-cutting the typical brush- and texture- gathering workflow. Through the use of boundary-aware texture synthesis  CATS produces strokes that are non-repeating and blend smoothly with each other. This allows CATS to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. We evaluated the effectiveness of CATS by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that CATS is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings.
378,INT019: Flowboard: A Visual Flow-Based Programming Environment for Embedded Coding,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Anke Brocker  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Tony Zelun Zhang  RWTH Aachen University Mathis Müller  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,With Maker-friendly environments like the Arduino IDE  embedded programming has become an important part of STEM education. But learning embedded programming is still hard  requiring both coding and basic electronics skills. To understand if a different programming paradigm can help  we developed Flowboard  which uses Flow-Based Programming (FBP) rather than the usual imperative programming paradigm. Instead of command sequences  learners assemble processing nodes into a graph through which signals and data flow. Flowboard consists of a visual flow-based editor on an iPad  a hardware frame integrating the iPad  an Arduino board and two breadboards next to the iPad  letting learners connect their visual graphs seamlessly to the input and output electronics. Graph edits take effect immediately  making Flowboard a live coding environment.
379,INT020: Live Programming By Example,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Mark Santolucito  Yale University William T. Hallahan  Yale University Ruzica Piskac  Yale University,Live programming is a novel approach for programming practice. Programmers are given real-time feedback when writing code  traditionally via a graphical user interface. Despite live programming's practical values  such as providing an easier overview of code and better understanding of its structure  it is not yet widely used. In this work  we extend live programming to general purpose code editors  which allows for live programming to be used by programmers  and provides new interfaces for understanding and changing the functionality of code. To achieve this we extended a fully-featured IDE with the ability to show input/output examples of code execution  as the programmer is writing code. Furthermore  we integrate programming by example (PBE) synthesis into our tool by allowing the user to change the shown output  and have the code update automatically. Our goal is to use live programming to give novice programmers a new way to interact and understand programming  as well as being a useful development tool for more advanced programmers.
380,INT021: Dynamic Depth-of-Field Projection for 3D Projection Mapping,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Lihui Wang  University of Tokyo Hongjin Xu  University of Tokyo Yunpu Hu  University of Tokyo Satoshi Tabata  University of Tokyo Masatoshi Ishikawa  University of Tokyo,Demonstration for a dynamic depth-of-field projection mapping on a 3D moving object would be performed. Conventional projection mapping was limited on 2D space  due to their narrow depth-of-field projection range. Our system included a high-speed projector  a high-speed variable focus lens  a depth sensor by a stereo camera  so that the depth information would be detected and then served as feedback to correct the focal length of the projection. As a result  a projection mapping would be well-focused projected on a 3D dynamic moving object.
381,INT022: Demonstration of Springlets: Expressive  Flexible and Silent On-Skin Tactile Interfaces,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Nur Al-huda Hamdan  RWTH Aachen University Adrian Wagner  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University Jürgen Steimle  Saarland University  Saarland Informatics Campus,We present Springlets  expressive  non-vibrating mechanotactile interfaces on the skin. Embedded with shape memory alloy springs  we implement Springlets as thin and flexible stickers to be worn on various body locations  thanks to their silent operation even on the neck and head. We present a technically simple and rapid technique for fabricating a wide range of Springlet interfaces. We developed six modular Springlets: a pincher  a directional stretcher  a presser  a puller  a dragger  and an expander (Fig. 1). In our hands-on demonstration  we show our modular Springlets and several Springlet interfaces for tactile social communication  physical guidance  health interfaces  navigation  and virtual reality gaming. Attendees can wear the interfaces and explore their expressive variable force profiles and spatiotemporal patterns.
382,INT023: A Sensing Technique for Data Glove Using Conductive Fiber,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Ryosuke Takada  University of Tsukuba Junichiro Kadomoto  The Univesity of Tokyo Buntarou Shizuki  University of Tsukuba,We demonstrate a sensing technique for data gloves using conductive fiber. This technique enables us to estimate hand shapes (bend of a finger and contact between fingers) and differentiates a grabbing tag. To estimate how far each finger bends  the electrical resistance of the conductive fiber is measured; this resistance decreases as the finger bends because the surface of the glove short circuits. To detect contact between fingers  we apply alternating currents with different frequencies to each finger and measure the signal propagation between the fingers. This principle is also used to differentiate a grabbing tag (each tag has an alternating current with a unique frequency). We developed a prototype data glove based on this technique.

This interactive artwork is experienced through the HTC Vive headset  with movement and touch key elements to the aesthetic of this work. It combines both a physical and a digital sculpture and in doing so creates a mixed reality that plays on a disconnect between what we can see and what we can feel.
387,INT028: Hypercept: Speculating the Visual World Intervened by Digital Media,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jiabao Li  Harvard Graduate School of Design Honghao Deng  Harvard Graduate School of Design Panagiotis Michalatos  Harvard Graduate School of Design,Human perception has long been influenced by technological breakthroughs. An intimate mediation of technology lies in between our direct perceptions and the environment we perceive. Through three extreme ideal types of perceptual machines  this project defamiliarizes and questions the habitual ways in which we interpret  operate  and understand the visual world intervened by digital media. The three machines create: Hyper-sensitive vision – a speculation on social media's amplification effect and our filtered communication landscape. Hyper-focused vision – an analogue version of the searching behavior on the Internet. Hyper-commoditized vision – monetized vision that meditates on the omnipresent advertisement targeted all over our visual field. The site of intervention is the visual field in a technologically augmented society. All the three machines have both internal state and external signal.

389,INT030: Come Hither to Me: Performance of a Seductive Robot,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Sahar Sajadieh  University of California  Santa Barbara Hannah Wolfe  University of California  Santa Barbara,Come Hither to Me is an interactive robotic performance  which examines the emotive social interaction between an audience and a robot. Our interactive robot attempts to communicate and flirt with audience members in the gallery. The robot uses feedback from sensors  auditory data  and computer vision techniques to learn about the participants and inform its conversation. The female robot approaches the audience  picks her favorites  and starts charming them with seductive comments  funny remarks  backhanded compliments  and personal questions. We are interested in evoking emotions in the participating audience through their interactions with the robot. Come Hither to Me strives to invert gender roles and stereotypical expectations in flirtatious interactions. This performative piece explores the dynamics of social communication  objectification of women  and the gamification of seduction. The robot reduces flirtation to an algorithm  codifying pick-up lines and sexting paradigms.

392,INT033: Death Ground,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Christos Michalakos  Abertay University Bernt Isak Wærstad  Norwegian University of Science and Technology,Death Ground is a competitive musical installation-game for two players. The work is designed to provide the framework for the players/participants in which to perform game-mediated musical gestures against each-other. The main mechanic involves destroying the other player's avatar by outmaneuvering and using audio weapons and improvised musical actions against it. These weapons are spawned in an enclosed area during the performance and can be used by whoever is collects them first. There is a multitude of such power-ups  all of which have different properties  such as speed boost  additional damage  ground traps and so on. All of these weapons affect the sound and sonic textures that each of the avatars produce. Additionally  the players can use elements of the environment such as platforms  obstructions and elevation in order to gain competitive advantage  or position themselves strategically to access first the spawned power-ups.
393,INT034: Keycube is a Kind of Keyboard (k^(3)),Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Damien Brun  Université TÉLUQ Charles Gouin-Vallerand  Université TÉLUQ Sébastien George  Le Mans Université,Alternate realities through headsets  such as augmented  mixed and virtual reality are becoming part of people's everyday life. Except in some limited context  usual keyboards are inappropriate for such technological medium and alternative interfaces for text-entry must be explored. In this paper we present the keycube  a general-purpose cubic handheld device that goes beyond the text-entry interface by including multiple keys  a touch-screen  an inertial unit with six degrees-of-freedom and a vibrotactile feedback. Strong of its form factor and affordance  the keycube offers advantages with regards to mobility  comfort  learnability  privacy and playfulness. Thus  the combination creates a novel text-entry interface convenient for many use cases across the whole reality-virtuality continuum.

402,INT044: Multisensory Virtual Environment for Fire Evacuation Training,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tommy Nilsson  University of Nottingham Tessa Roper  University of Nottingham Emily Shaw  University of Nottingham Glyn Lawson  University of Nottingham Sue V. G. Cobb  University of Nottingham Hsieh Meng-Ko  University of Nottingham Daniel Miller  University of Nottingham James Khan  University of Nottingham,Growing organizational safety awareness is propelling the interest in development of novel solutions for fire training. Significant effort in this area has previously gone into designing various immersive virtual reality (VR) systems in hopes of enabling safe exploration and experiencing the consequences of ones actions in scenarios that would be too hazardous in the real life. Yet  the fact that VR generally lacks the sensory feedback of a real life fire situation has been found to impede a sense of realism and validity of such experiences. As part of our efforts to mitigate this issue  we now present a new prototype fire evacuation simulator designed to deliver not just audiovisual feedback  but likewise real-time heat and scent stimulation.
403,INT045: 3D Positional Movement Interaction with User-Defined  Virtual Interface for Music Software: MoveMIDI,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Timothy Arterbury  Baylor University G. Michael Poor  Baylor University,This paper describes progress made in design and development of a new digital musical instrument (MIDI controller)  MoveMIDI  and highlights its unique 3D positional movement interaction design differing from recent orientational and gestural approaches. A user constructs and interacts with MoveMIDI's virtual  3D interface using handheld position-tracked controllers to control music software  as well as non-musical technology such as stage lighting. MoveMIDI's virtual interface contributes to solving problems difficult to solve with hardware MIDI controller interfaces such as customized positioning and instantiation of interface elements  and accurate  simultaneous control of independent parameters. MoveMIDI's positional interaction mirrors interaction with some physical acoustic instruments and provides visualization for an audience. Beta testers of MoveMIDI have created emergent use cases for the instrument.
404,INT046: Are Drones Meditative?,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Joseph La Delfa  RMIT University Mehmet Aydin Baytas  Qualisys AB Olivia Wichtowski  RMIT University Rohit Ashok Khot  RMIT University Florian Floyd Mueller  RMIT University,Meditative movement involves regulating attention to the body whilst moving  to create a state of meditation. This can be difficult for beginners  we propose that drones can facilitate this as they can move with and give feedback to whole body movements. We present a demonstration that explores various ways drones could facilitate meditative movement by drawing attention to the body. We designed a two-handed control map for the drone that engages multiple parts of the body  a light foam casing to give the impression that the drone is floating and an onboard light which gives feedback to the speed of the movement. The user will experience both leading and following the drone to explore the interplay between mapping  form  feedback and instruction. The demonstration relates to an expansion of the attention regulation framework  which is used to inform the design of interactive meditative experiences and human-drone interactions.

407,INT049: Movie+: Towards Exploring Social Effects of Emotional Fingerprints for Video Clips and Movies,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Anton Fedosov  Università della Svizzera italiana Bianca Stancu  Università della Svizzera italiana Elena Di Lascio  Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) Davide Eynard  Università della Svizzera italiana Marc Langheinrich  Faculty of Computer Science,"Collaborative movie viewing with the loved ones increases connectedness and social bonds within family members and friends. Furthermore  with the rapid adoption of personal mobile devices  people often engage in this activity being geographically separated. However  conveying our feelings and emotions about a recently watched movie or a video clip is often limited to a post on social media or a short blurb on an instant messaging app. Drawing on the popular interest in quantified-self  which envisioned one collecting and sharing biophysical information from everyday routines (e.g.  workouts)  we have designed and developed Movie+  a mobile application  which utilizes personal biophysical data to construct an individual's ""emotional fingerprint"" while viewing a video clip. Movie+ allows the selective sharing of this information through different visualization options  as well as rendering others' emotional fingerprints over the same clip. In this submission  we outline the design rationale and briefly describe our application prototype."
408,INT050: PhotoFlow in Action: Picture-Mediated Reminiscence Supporting Family Socio-Connectivity,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Benett Axtell  University of Toronto Cosmin Munteanu  University of Toronto & University of Toronto Mississauga,Family connections are maintained through sharing reminiscences  often supported by family photographs which easily prompt memories. This is increasingly important as we age  as picture-based reminiscence has been shown to reduce older adults' social isolation. However  there is a gap between sharing memories from physical pictures and the limited support for oral social reminiscence afforded by digital tools. PhotoFlow supports older adults' picture-mediated social storytelling of family memories using an intuitive metaphor mirroring sharing physical family pictures on a table top. The app uses the speech of oral storytelling to automatically organize pictures based only on what has been said. This simplifies the overall process of family picture interactions by leveraging one enjoyable aspect to ease a more effortful one. In particular  the familiar table top interaction metaphor has the potential to bridge the gap between physical picture reminiscence and managing digital picture collections.
409,Empowering Expression for Users with Aphasia through Constrained Creativity,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Timothy Neate  City  University of London Abi Roper  City  University of London Stephanie Wilson  City  University of London Jane Marshall  City  University of London,Creative activities allow people to express themselves in rich  nuanced ways. However  being creative does not always come easily. For example  people with speech and language impairments  such as aphasia  face challenges in creative activities that involve language. In this paper  we explore the concept of constrained creativity as a way of addressing this challenge and enabling creative writing. We report an app  MakeWrite  that supports the constrained creation of digital texts through automated redaction. The app was co-designed with and for people with aphasia and was subsequently explored in a workshop with a group of people with aphasia. Participants were not only successful in crafting novel language  but  importantly  self-reported that the app was crucial in enabling them to do so. We refect on the potential of technology-supported constrained creativity as a means of empowering expression amongst users with diverse needs.
410,LBW2810: Minimalistic Explanations: Capturing the Essence of Decisions,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Martin Schuessler  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut Philipp Weiß  Technische Universität Berlin & Weizenbaum Institut,The use of complex machine learning models can make systems opaque to users. Machine learning research proposes the use of post-hoc explanations. However  it is unclear if they give users insights into otherwise uninterpretable models. One minimalistic way of explaining image classifications by a deep neural network is to show only the areas that were decisive for the assignment of a label. In a pilot study  20 participants looked at 14 of such explanations generated either by a human or the LIME algorithm. For explanations of correct decisions  they identified the explained object with significantly higher accuracy (75.64 % vs. 18.52 %). We argue that this shows that explanations can be very minimalistic while retaining the essence of a decision  but the decision-making contexts that can be conveyed in this manner is limited. Finally  we found that explanations are unique to the explainer and human-generated explanations were assigned 79 % higher trust ratings. As a starting point for further studies  this work shares our first insights into quality criteria of post-hoc explanations.
411,LBW2511: Supporting Data Workers To Perform Exploratory Programming,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Krishna Subramanian  RWTH Aachen University Ilya Zubarev  RWTH Aachen University Simon Voelker  RWTH Aachen University Jan Borchers  RWTH Aachen University,Data science is an open-ended task in whichexploratory programming is a common practice. Data workers often need faster and easier ways to explore alternative approaches to obtain insights from data  which frequently compromises code quality. To understand how well current IDEs support this exploratory workflow  we conducted an observational study with 19 data workers. In this paper  we present two significant findings from our analysis that highlight issues faced by data workers: (a)code hoarding and (b) excessivetask switching andcode cloning. To mitigate these issues  we provide design recommendations based on existing work  and propose to augment IDEs with an interactive visual plugin. This plugin parses source code to identify and visualize high-level task details. Data workers can use the resulting visualization to better understand and navigate the source code. As a realization of this idea  we presentAddIn  an add-in for RStudio that identifies and visualizes the hypotheses that a data worker is testing for statistical significance through her source code.
412,Voice-Based Quizzes for Measuring Knowledge Retention in Under-Connected Populations,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Agha Ali Raza  Information Technology University Zain Tariq  Information Technology University Shan Randhawa  Information Technology University Bilal Saleem  Information Technology University Awais Athar  European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) Umar Saif  Information Technology University Roni Rosenfeld  Carnegie Mellon University,Information dissemination using automated phone calls allows reaching low-literate and tech-naive populations. Open challenges include rapid verification of expected knowledge gaps in the community  dissemination of specific information to address these gaps  and follow-up measurement of knowledge retention. We report Sawaal  a voice-based telephone service that uses audio-quizzes to address these challenges. Sawaal allows its open community of users to post and attempt multiple-choice questions and to vote and comment on them. Sawaal spreads virally as users challenge friends to quiz competitions. Administrator-posted questions allow confirming specific knowledge gaps  spreading correct information and measuring knowledge retention via rephrased  repeated questions. In 14 weeks and with no advertisement  Sawaal reached 3 433 users (120 119 calls) in Pakistan  who contributed 13 276 questions that were attempted 455 158 times by 2 027 users. Knowledge retention remained significant for up to two weeks. Surveys revealed that 71% of the mostly low-literate  young  male users were blind.
413,SDC01: NeighBoard: Facilitating Community Policing with Embodied Tech Design,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Crystal Compton  University of Minnesota Ellen Dupler  University of Minnesota J. Walter Lee  University of Minnesota,Augmenting grassroots community policing (CP) efforts with technologies that assist citizens is a promising strategy for reducing real and perceived fear of crime. We used a human-centered design approach  working with residents of the St. Paul Summit-University neighborhood  to discern abstract functionalities for developing new CP technology. We then created and evaluated NeighBoard (Figure 1)  which aims to enhance the social fabric of communities by letting citizens implement their own strategies for preventing crime and maintaining safety in their neighborhood.
414,SDC02: Co ed: A Classroom Setup for Enhancing Cooperative Learning and Digital Literacy,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Anand Kishore  National Institute of Design Cletus V. Joseph  National Institute of Design Lamha Bijili  National Institute of Design Md. Aasif Anwar  National Institute of Design Urvi  National Institute of Design,The current Indian education system promotes competition among students  emphasizing highly on ranks and marks scored. As a consequence  students tend to drift away from a collaborative mindset to a competitive one. The learning gap is even larger in schools catering to lower income groups due to the absence of digital infrastructure and digital knowledge. As a result  a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge  the internet  causing the gap to increase between students in the society. With co ed  we attempt to bridge these gaps by providing a platform to foster mutual learning as well as combining digital mediums and the long-established pen and paper in a seamless manner.
415,SDC03: Drawxi: An Accessible Drawing Tool for Collaboration,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Suraj Chiplunkar  Indiana University Anany Maini  Indiana University Dinesh Ram  Indiana University Zixuan Zheng  Indiana University Yaxin Zheng  Indiana University Bloomington,Visual impairment can profoundly impact well-being and social advancement. Current solutions for accessing graphical information fail to provide an affordable  user-friendly collaborative platform for visually impaired and sighted people to work together. Therefore  sighted users tend to have low expectations from visually impaired people while working in a team. Hence  visually impaired people feel discouraged to participate in a mixed population collaborative environment. Consequently  their generative capabilities remain devalued. In this paper  we propose an audio-haptic enabled tool (Drawxi) for free-form sketching and sharing simple diagrams (processes  workflows  ideas  perspectives  etc.). It provides a common platform for visually-impaired and sighted people to work together by communicating each other's ideas visually. Thus  enabling the discovery of generative capabilities in a hands-on way. We relied upon participatory research methods (Contextual inquiry  Co-Design) involving visually impaired participants throughout the design process. We evaluated our proposed design through usability testing which revealed that collaboration between visually impaired and sighted people benefits from the use of common tools and platforms. Thereby  enhancing the degree of their participation in a collaborative environment and quality of co-creation activities.
416,SDC04: Shadoji: View Body Shapes from a Different Angle,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Xuan Jin  University of Michigan Peipei Nie  University of Michigan Xizi Wang  University of Michigan Zhuo Wang  University of Michigan Chunying Zhang  University of Michigan,"Body shape anxiety is one of the common problems distressing people around the world. While people are constantly suffering from body shape anxiety  they do not realize that beauty standard is not an absolute truth and that it is changing and depends on time and space. To help people free from the constraint imposed by social beauty standards and connect those who have concerns over their body shape  we devised a technological solution named ""Shadoji""  which can bring people a new perspective on their body shapes  give them a chance to create their unique body shape emoji  and to explore diverse body shapes from users around the world."
417,SDC05: Give Me a Break: Design for Communication Among Family Caregivers and Respite Caregivers,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Flannery Currin  Earlham College Gustavo Razo  University of California  Merced Aehong Min  Indiana University Bloomington,This study focuses on solutions to issues that arise from gaps in communication between primary family caregivers of older adults and respite caregivers. We collected data through 18 semi-structured interviews with primary family and respite caregivers and qualitatively analyzed the interviews to extract common needs. Participants identified three main needs that our designs address: building trust through status updates  learning routines & care management  and accessing technology. Based on those needs  we designed a prototype of an application which connects primary family caregivers with respite caregivers and facilitates communication between the involved parties. This design can serve as a framework for future work designed to improve elder care in general  the well-being of caregivers  and the effectiveness of respite care.
418,SDC06: Amor: Supporting Emerging Adult Couples to Manage Finances for a Common Goal,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Mintra Ruensuk  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Jayeong Yoon  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Cho eun Park  Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,A healthy romantic relationship is one of the life goals of many couples. Sharing feelings  emotions  thoughts  activities  and even finances enables couples to spend quality time with each other. In particular  financial management plays an important role in relationship quality of emerging adult couples. We present Amor  a mobile application that bridges emerging adult couples closely to pool and spend their money together for a common goal. Amor also allows the couples to explore activities that harmonize with their characteristics as well as an encouragement for the two to achieve their desired goals.
419,SDC07: SENTI? Reconnect with Yourself to Better Connect with Others,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Audrey Drolet  Université Laval Thomas Lemonde-Marzell  Université Laval Pablo Matos Da Silva  Université Laval Kim Lamontagne  Université Laval Marjorie Bédard  Université Laval,Occidental societies are becoming increasingly demanding. Citizens often feel overwhelmed and feel the need to rest  which they do so by isolating themselves from others. Individuals who use this time alone to reflect on their situation find that this reflection helps create deeper connections with others afterwards. With this in mind  we developed Senti?  a solution that aims to encourage people to take time for themselves in hopes that it will lead them to be more open-minded when interacting with others. The solution helps people focus on bodily sensations and generates a comfortable and effortless time for introspection. Senti? uses the subconscious benefits of perceiving one's heartbeat to foster personal reflection.
420,SDC08: Haptic Remembrance Book Series,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Elaine Czech  Keio University Mina Shibasaki  Keio University Keitaro Tsuchiya  Keio University,While having strong social networks is essential for good quality of life  socializing gets more difficult as we age even if we are surrounded by people in a nursing home setting. Care staff and family members want to be able to connect with residents/loved ones but have limitations (time constraints  unsure how)  and it can be challenging to feel a connection to another resident who has differing abilities. We propose that through sharing strong positive memories  members of a nursing home community (residents  care staff  and families) will be able to build empathy for one another and thus strengthen their community bonds. By applying multi-modal technologies to a familiar medium  the book  we provided a means by which intergenerational users  from various backgrounds  could interact with and gain meaning from the content.
421,SDC09: HelloBox: Creating Safer and Kid-friendly Communities,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Tab Zhang  University of Minnesota Yongle Zhang  University of Minnesota Leyi Sun  University of Minnesota Lily Dunk  University of Minnesota,Children's ability to walk to school or play around their neighborhoods without parental supervision has severely declined in the past decade. Loss of local activities and mobility may leave children prepared for transitions to adulthood and make them less independent and may have negative health effects. In this paper  we discuss the findings of our research on children's unsupervised play in their neighborhoods. We propose HelloBox  a system including an app  wearable RFID tags  and check-in stations to keep track of children when they are outside without an adult. HelloBox lets parents know where their children are without restricting their independence and builds community between local families. The project focuses on improving children's independent mobility and encouraging social interactions between families within neighborhoods.
422,SDC10: HearU: An Integrated System to Raise Awareness of Hearing Loss,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Beijia Wang  University of Washington Mengxiao Song  University of Washington Yuting Han  University of Washington Duo Wang  University of Washington,Hearing loss is a prevalent public health crisis that often goes unnoticed in public eye due to its invisibility. People who are hard of hearing (HH) often experience social isolation caused by the lack of understanding from the hearing community. Our research revealed that there is a communication gap between the hearing and HH communities. The current state of art tends to focus on assisting HH people to participate in conversations  which places more responsibility on the HH community. There is a lack of responsibility of people in the hearing community. However  communication works in two directions; it requires both parties to take responsibility. In this paper  we present HearU - an integrated  multichannel system that includes public interaction. Through the creation of an immersive experience that increases people's awareness of hearing loss  we aim to use HearU as a medium to weave these two communities together as a whole.
423,SDC11: PALS: Patching ALS through Crowdsourced Advice  Social Links & Public Awareness,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Richard Cave  University College London Karina Kocemba  University College London Svjetlana Dajic  University College London Holloe Bostock  University College London Alastair Cook  University College London,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a serious and poorly understood disease  impacting 50 000 people a year globally. Our research found that people with ALS express a lack of connection with other people with the disease  and that the general public lacks awareness about ALS. We also identified an engagement problem with the currently available resources to connect and support people with ALS. To address these issues  we introduce 'PALS' - an accessible crowdsourcing and connection quilt  first hung like a tapestry in the ALS clinic  then later used as an interactive public display. The quilt offers the opportunity to access crowdsourced information concerning individual experiences of ALS. Our work offers three primary contributions: 1) adding to limited HCI research concerning the ALS community by establishing the needs  2) applying the 'PALS' quilt design solution to these needs  and 3) combining three modalities: crowdsourcing  tangible tapestry displays  and interactive waiting education in a unique way.
424,SDC12: TechBuddies: Engaging Students to Teach Retirees about Technology,Monday  May 06  2019 - 17:30:00,Monday  May 06  2019 19:30,Hall 4,Jim Philippe Neussl  University College London Rebecca Zheng  University College London George Hanson  University College London Boyin Yang  University College London,Retirees suffer from impaired mobility  loss of friends and family  and loneliness. Although these problems could be mitigated through the use of digital communication devices and the internet  many retirees lack the skill and confidence to use them effectively. The existing community initiatives that aim to help retirees understand technology often lack volunteers to teach them. This is why we developed TechBuddies  a two-component system aimed at engaging more students as volunteers. The first component consists of an interactive display that raises awareness about volunteering opportunities by simulating an interaction between a retiree and the potential volunteer. The second component involves an app-based platform that facilitates communication about events and encourages long-term engagement. TechBuddies raises awareness about and provides a platform for inter-generational interactions between students and retirees who are a part of the same local community.
